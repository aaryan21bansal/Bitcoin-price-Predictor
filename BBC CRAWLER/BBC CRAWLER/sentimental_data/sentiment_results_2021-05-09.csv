"A cyber-criminal gang that took a major US fuel pipeline offline over the weekend has acknowledged the incident in a public statement. ""Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide wrote on its website. The US issued emergency legislation on Sunday after Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack. The pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel. The operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack. Work to restore service is continuing. How did cyber-attackers shut off a US pipeline? The ransomware surge ruining lives Travelex being held to ransom by hackers On Monday, the FBI officially confirmed that DarkSide was responsible for compromising Colonial Pipeline's networks, saying that it was continuing to work with the firm and other government agencies on the investigation. During a speech about the economy at the White House on Monday, US President Joe Biden said that he was being ""personally briefed"" on the situation with the pipeline each day. US President Joe Biden answers questions about the fuel pipeline cyber-attack during a speech about the economy at the White House ""The agencies across the government have acted quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply,"" he said. ""We're prepared to take additional steps depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back up to capacity."" A number of cyber-security researchers, including firms contacted by the BBC, have speculated that the cyber-criminal gang could be Russian, as their software avoids encrypting any computer systems where the language is set as Russian. Mr Biden said that the US government was concerned about this aspect of the cyber-attack. ""I'm gonna be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence, based on our intelligence people, that Russia is involved,"" he said. ""Although, there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia - they have some responsibility to deal with this."" DarkSide posted a statement on its website on Monday, describing itself as ""apolitical"". The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day ""We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,"" the group said. The group also indicated it had not been aware that Colonial was being targeted by one of its affiliates, saying: ""From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future."" US fuel prices at the pump rose six cents per gallon on the week to $2.967 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said on Monday, while Wall Street shares in US energy firms were up 1.5%. The AAA said prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014. On Sunday, the US governmentrelaxed rules on fuel being transported by road,externalto minimise disruption to supply. This allowed drivers in 18 states to work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products. However, there are fears that this could change if the shutdown is prolonged. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas. ""Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,"" said Mr Sharma. ""The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York."" He said oil futures traders were now ""scrambling"" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining. Demand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers. The temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned. Sources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday. The gang stole almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet. The FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond - the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported. On Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remained offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational. ""Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,""the firm said,external. It added it would bring its full system back online ""only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations"". An example of a DarkSide ransomware notice that appears on victims' computer screens The incident highlightsthe risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure,external, not just businesses. In addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted. The gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a ""personal leak page"" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up. DarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network. According to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm,DarkSide operates like a business,external. A redacted screenshot of DarkSide's website on the dark web details its success in attacking a large US manufacturer The gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies. It then provides ransomware to ""affiliates"" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks. When it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it. It even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an ""ethics"" page where it says which organisations it will not attack. DarkSide also works with ""access brokers"" - nefarious hackers who work to harvest the login details for as many working user accounts on various services as they can find. Rather than break into these accounts and alert users or the service providers, these brokers sit on the usernames and passwords and sell them off to the highest bidders - cyber-criminal gangs who want to use them to carry out much larger crimes. Digital Shadows thinks the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home. James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, believes DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop. DarkSide's website on the dark web details its achievements and sets out ""ethics"" of sorts He says it is possible for anyone to look up the login portals for computers connected to the internet on search engines like Shodan, and then ""have-a-go"" hackers just keep trying usernames and passwords until they get some to work. ""We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,"" said Mr Chappell. ""The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally."" Digital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling. LNER passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: ScotRail between Aberdeen and Edinburgh Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough CrossCountry between Leeds, York and Edinburgh Rail replacement coaches are operating at York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and also between Doncaster and Peterborough.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says it would be ""absurd"" if things ever got close to the point of taking the SNP to court. Scotland's first minister has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a second independence referendum is ""a matter of when - not if"". Nicola Sturgeon spoke directly with Mr Johnson for the first time since the SNP won an emphatic victory in Thursday's Holyrood election. Earlier, Ms Sturgeon said she did not expect the debate to end up in court. A senior UK government minister appeared to suggest it would not mount a legal challenge to her plans. During a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday afternoon, the first minister pledged to work with the UK government on steering the country through the Covid pandemic towards recovery. Scottish election 2021: Results in maps and charts How the newspapers reacted in Scotland The SNP said the leaders also agreed the importance of both governments working together ""closely and constructively"" to make the forthcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow a success. But a party spokeswoman added: ""The FM also re-iterated her intention to ensure that the people of Scotland can choose our own future when the crisis is over, and made clear that the question of a referendum is now a matter of when - not if."" Boris Johnson has invited Ms Sturgeon to a summit on a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic The UK Government said Mr Johnson spoke to the first minister to ""congratulate her on her party's success"" in the Scottish Parliament election. A spokesman said the prime minister emphasised ""the importance of focusing on Covid recovery at this time"". He added: ""They both agreed that their immediate focus should be on working together to build back from the pandemic. ""The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation for the first minister to join a summit meeting to discuss our shared challenges on Covid recovery and how we can overcome them."" Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned whether she would introduce a referendum bill as early as next spring based on predictions that the UK will have recovered in terms of coronavirus circulation and GDP. She said: ""That would certainly work for that timescale of within the first half of the parliamentary term. ""I desperately hope those predictions are correct but we have to judge that as we go through this year. We've still got significant challenges ahead. I wouldn't rule that out but I'm not sitting here saying that is the timescale."" Mr Johnson earlier invited Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford to a summit to discuss a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic. He has said it would be ""reckless and irresponsible"" to have a referendum right now, and the UK government is not currently expected to grant formal consent for a vote to be held - as it did ahead of the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon congratulated five of the SNP's new MSPs on Sunday morning There has been speculation that the row could end up with the courts being asked to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a referendum without the UK government's agreement. But Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe either side wanted a legal battle over the issue. She said: ""The UK government knows that if we ever get into a situation where this is being determined in the courts then actually what the UK government is arguing is that there is no democratic route for Scotland to have independence. ""The implications of that would be very grave indeed. If the argument of the unionist side is that Scotland is trapped it strikes me that that is one of the strongest arguments for independence.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Ms Sturgeon also said it would be ""absurd and completely outrageous"" if the UK government went to court over the issue and that it was ""up to the Scottish people"" to decide the country's future. Her party stood on a manifesto to steer the country out of the pandemic, and to then hold a referendum, which she said people had ""voted overwhelmingly for"". She added: ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" Also appearing on the programme, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he would ""not go near"" the issue of the UK government potentially challenging a referendum bill in court. He said: ""Whatever parties we come from, the priority at the moment is not court cases, it's not independence legislation - it is recovery from the pandemic."" When asked if Scotland was allowed to leave the UK, he said: ""Of course it is, through a legal referendum which would allow people to make that choice."" But he also insisted that the SNP's failure to win an overall majority showed that the people of Scotland were not ""agitating"" for a referendum. The SNP finished on 64 seats in Thursday's Scottish election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016 - while the Conservatives won 31, Labour 22, the pro-independence Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. But Mr Gove said a majority of voters - 51% - had backed parties that were opposed to independence in the constituency ballot - although the same percentage voted for pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove appeared on Marr during a visit to Scotland BBC Scotland's Sunday Show later asked Mr Gove to clarify the indication he gave to Marr that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove said: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principal focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denied he was giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill, saying ""we are concentrating on recovery at the moment"". In her victory speech, Ms Sturgeon said her priority was leading the country through the pandemic - but said she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. In aletter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night, the prime minister invited Ms Sturgeon to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility.""

"Overshadowed by the Tories - Sir Keir Starmer on Friday morning, as the election picture unfolded Ever since his election as Labour leader a year ago Sir Keir Starmer has emphasised that the party has an electoral mountain to climb. He conquered the foothills pretty quickly - stressing new leadership and even suspending the former leader. The early emphasis was on eliminating negatives - in particular the stain of anti-Semitism. As long as the new leader continued making steady if slow progress, most of the internal grumbling - or downright opposition - was likely to be limited to the party's left. And not even all of them. But slipping back down the mountain has led to nervousness, and restlessness among those he leads. Starmer faced his first electoral test on Thursday with the Hartlepool by-election. It is a seat Labour has held since it was created in 1974, and defended even as its other red wall constituencies fell in 2019. But, by Friday morning the coastal town in North East England, had switched to Boris Johnson's Conservatives. Insiders say the party performed worse than its internal polling had suggested on Thursday - anditwasn't very positive. But it wasn't the only significant loss. There was Harlow council in Essex, and in Sunderland it lost ground. While the pandemic has blunted Starmer's ability to oppose the government outright, some who supported his leadership are wondering why he is stumbling in much more favourable political weather when it should have been the government that was on the back foot, over ""sleaze"". One of them told us that Starmer's task now, is ""to incinerate the politics of the far left"". Meanwhile some on the left are calling for ""radical change"". The majority in Hartlepool was always vulnerable. The last time this parliamentary seat was fought, in 2019, the now-defunct Brexit Party took more than 10,000 votes. Many of these were looking for a new home. But it raises questions over Labour's approach. Sir Keir Starmer has stressed his patriotism and accepted the Brexit deal. Yet that doesn't seem to have been enough to detoxify the party's image among some former Labour, pro-Brexit voters. But there were other factors. A prominent politician who spent some time campaigning in Hartlepool blamed the hollowing out of the party during the Corbyn era, with strong organisational, as much as political expertise and experience, lost. Another, who spent a lot of time on the town's doorsteps, said the party was afflicted by the phenomenon of ""long Corbyn"". One frontbencher said at least people weren't angry with Labour any more. They just weren't particularly inspired either. This, he assessed, was a weird election where people were interested in vaccines and the lifting of restrictions. ""People ask me 'Is the Tory sleaze stuff cutting through?' The honest answer is virtually nothing is cutting through."" Others heap blame on Labour's candidate in Hartlepool - Dr Paul Williams - and how he was chosen. Dr Paul Williams, right, Labour's candidate in Hartlepool, was chosen from a ""list of one"" Selecting an NHS doctor as a candidate amid the Covid crisis seemed like the perfect remedy to Labour's red wall blues.  But first Williams had to apologise for sexist social media posts from a decade ago. Then, the Conservatives accused him of playing a part in decisions that removed services from Hartlepool's hospital, though he pointed to his recent efforts to bring them back. But the means by which Williams was picked has given critics of Starmer's office added ammunition. Williams was chosen from a one-person shortlist. He campaigned for Remain in the referendum and lost in a nearby seat in the last general election. Several Labour MPs - from different wings of the party - are blaming Starmer's political secretary, Baroness Chapman, for the decision. One told us: ""He is her mate but putting him in was a mind boggling decision since Hartlepool is the centre of Planet Brexit."" POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area? VOTE:Why full results might take longer BBC:How to follow the election results The problem for Labour is that Friday's election results suggest Hartlepool is not exceptional. In a range of councils covering areas outside the big metropolitan centres, and where a majority voted for Brexit, Labour has slipped back rather than edging forward. Some majorities were lost but in others - such as Sunderland - they were eroded. One council leader in northern England told us: ""The party nationally is just saying to people 'I'm on your side'. We are not bringing stuff forward to help really transform the lives of people in the North. The party still looks and sounds like a metropolitan, middle class party."" He confided he has raised ""the lack of a message for the North"" with the leadership, but ""it's like banging my head against a brick wall"". Concerns over the apparent lack of a message aren't confined to northern English councillors. An MP who campaigned in Hartlepool and various council contests, had a confession: ""I was hoping you weren't going to ask me to recite precisely what the message is because I think I'd struggle to tell you that. ""This is a fairly bland, vanilla messaging, which seems [aimed at] maximising the minimum number of people who it will offend. What's our plan to unlock the huge potential of the North? That is still a bit of a blank canvas. And that is a bit of a problemâ¦ [I]t doesn't give us the ammunition that people need on the doorstep.""' An MP representing a seat in north-east England put it even more bluntly: ""People think we don't know our arse from our elbow."" So much for the message - what of the messenger himself? Those involved in the election campaigns, from all sides of the party, report Starmer has not made enough impact. Many are understanding and like him. Some praise his move away from the Corbyn era and commend his prime ministerial persona. But they say his image with crucial target voters must improve. ""People get a sense of who Boris is and what he's about,"" said one Yorkshire MP. ""You know they've got the measure of him. The problem with Keir is that people don't have the measure of him yet."" This chimes with the view among some in Starmer's office that the pandemic prevented him - someone who has an interesting backstory and a record of achievement as a lawyer - from being properly introduced to the public. Some of his own MPs believe, though, it's also about leaving a lasting impression. ""He is hugely capable but in the end, politics is not a meritocracy,"" said one, ""and it's not always the best person who prevails. It's a battle of wills and ideologies. We need to up our game.' There are harsher verdicts. An MP who is by no means on the left of the party confesses: ''I just don't know what Keir stands for."" A Labour colleague of theirs from northern England reports this from the doorsteps: 'Where people comment, they think he is boring.' People from across the party are - remarkably - in agreement about the nature of the difficulties. But there's not the same consensus around potential solutions. As Starmer struggles with his electoral mountain, it's like some in the party are shouting ""We need crampons!"" while others say ""Let's crack open the Kendal Mint Cake and take stock of where we are."" Some shadow ministers tell us of difficulties in getting access to the leadership, whether it is to give advice or get ""attack lines"" signed off. They are privately calling for changes to the ""engine room"" - the Leader of the Opposition's office - but can't agree them. Some on the left want Jenny Chapman, once a leading light in the centrist Progress group, removed, and the departure of Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Interestingly, though, a shadow minister not on the left agrees that Starmer needs a chief of staff who can ""really hold things together- a more respected political figure"". Others who want to see changes in Starmer's office believe Chapman and McSweeney have been outstanding for providing direction, and haven't baulked at taking difficult decisions. McSweeney is credited by some for aiding Anas Sarwar to stand as party leader in Scotland, rather than await a potentially poorer result under his predecessor, Richard Leonard. They want different changes among the leader's staff. Sir Keir Starmer will be very well aware of the ""mumbles and grumbles""  - as one of his top team put it - around his leadership. That's why shadow communities secretary Steve Reed was sent round the broadcast studios on Friday morning to assert the problem wasn't Starmer, but the party. And the leader will ""push harder"" to change the party, not vice versa. Insiders say as a reaction to the election results, two things are likely to happen. First, changes in staffing at the Labour HQ, including a strengthening of the communications team. Second, a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. A long-standing Labour MP told me that would be a ""wily move [helping] stifle criticism in the wake of the elections, as who is going to speak out if they think their job is at risk?"" Tony Blair and ""big figures"" Gordon Brown and Robin Cook (second and third from left), and Jack Straw (second from right) There is a feeling that many shadow ministers haven't made enough impact collectively or, in some cases, individually. One frontbencher pointed to some of the ""big figures"" when Labour was in opposition in the 1990s - Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, Jack Straw - and said Starmer needed five or six ""star players"" in the top team. ""There will be no leadership challenge,"" a leading left-winger told us. This is partly due to there being no agreement on who a challenger would be. A prominent colleague of his on the left predicted that if Starmer were to go, it would be due to private pressure from those on the other wing of the party. But installing - for want of a better description - an anti-Corbyn, or more centrist leader, without a contest wouldn't be straightforward.  Not least because the current deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who is popular among members and seen as more left-wing than Starmer, would stand. This might mean putsch wouldn't come to shove. There do not seem to be fully fledged leadership campaigns, but there is a great deal of chatter. A frontbench supporter of Starmer believes he is safe for now and that the shadow cast by the pandemic has been a long one. But once it dissipates, this backer said ""if we are no further forward in a year's time he is in trouble - we could be just a year away from an election"". Some on what is seen as the party's ""soft left"" are pondering a return to Westminster for Andy Burnham, despite his likely re-election as mayor of Greater Manchester on Friday. Some say they would urge him to consider another tilt at the leadership if the polls haven't improved in the new year. Others are suggesting Yvette Cooper should offer herself as - at the very least - a caretaker leader, taking the party into the next election campaign. Starmer doesn't want to be bogged down by too much baggage as he tries to climb his electoral mountain. So he won't be spending the summer writing an election manifesto. But Lord Mandelson, a leading light in the Tony Blair's New Labour movement, has told the BBC it istime to conduct a policy review, to thin out the bulky 2019 manifesto, and, in the process, develop ideas that may be attractive to target voters. Policy workhas been going on under the radarbut internal critics say it lacks definition. And there is a danger that each solution simply brings another problem. An analysis by the former shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, suggests as Starmer tries to woo former voters by stressing his patriotism, he is inadvertently encouraging some more radical, middle class supporters, including former Corbyn supporters, to defect to the Greens. Indeed, early results show Labour losing some council wards in north-east England to Green candidates. Though this exodus isn't huge, it could - he argues - cost the party marginal Westminster seats in the North. Trickett told the BBC ""the public have put the leadership on notice"". He has research suggesting many voters in seats that turned blue in 2019 actually share -economically if not culturally - left-wing values, such as agreeing the state should narrow wealth inequalities welfare should be more generous and that corporate greed was a problem. But a shadow minister, not on the left of the party, said: ""Boris Johnson is occupying so much of our territory. He has actually paid people not to go out to work. The state-run NHS has delivered his vaccination programme."" And at a virtual seminar for Labour-supporting business figures, a prominent pollster told the audience that the party's (likely) success in London was a double-edged sword. The pollster argued it simply reinforced the perception that Labour was no longer for once-traditional voters in Northern towns. That perception - rather than policies - was proving a near impenetrable problem. These difficulties transcend personalities and would provide a challenge for any leader. But for now it is Starmer and his team who must devise a means of addressing them.

"Overshadowed by the Tories - Sir Keir Starmer on Friday morning, as the election picture unfolded Ever since his election as Labour leader a year ago Sir Keir Starmer has emphasised that the party has an electoral mountain to climb. He conquered the foothills pretty quickly - stressing new leadership and even suspending the former leader. The early emphasis was on eliminating negatives - in particular the stain of anti-Semitism. As long as the new leader continued making steady if slow progress, most of the internal grumbling - or downright opposition - was likely to be limited to the party's left. And not even all of them. But slipping back down the mountain has led to nervousness, and restlessness among those he leads. Starmer faced his first electoral test on Thursday with the Hartlepool by-election. It is a seat Labour has held since it was created in 1974, and defended even as its other red wall constituencies fell in 2019. But, by Friday morning the coastal town in North East England, had switched to Boris Johnson's Conservatives. Insiders say the party performed worse than its internal polling had suggested on Thursday - anditwasn't very positive. But it wasn't the only significant loss. There was Harlow council in Essex, and in Sunderland it lost ground. While the pandemic has blunted Starmer's ability to oppose the government outright, some who supported his leadership are wondering why he is stumbling in much more favourable political weather when it should have been the government that was on the back foot, over ""sleaze"". One of them told us that Starmer's task now, is ""to incinerate the politics of the far left"". Meanwhile some on the left are calling for ""radical change"". The majority in Hartlepool was always vulnerable. The last time this parliamentary seat was fought, in 2019, the now-defunct Brexit Party took more than 10,000 votes. Many of these were looking for a new home. But it raises questions over Labour's approach. Sir Keir Starmer has stressed his patriotism and accepted the Brexit deal. Yet that doesn't seem to have been enough to detoxify the party's image among some former Labour, pro-Brexit voters. But there were other factors. A prominent politician who spent some time campaigning in Hartlepool blamed the hollowing out of the party during the Corbyn era, with strong organisational, as much as political expertise and experience, lost. Another, who spent a lot of time on the town's doorsteps, said the party was afflicted by the phenomenon of ""long Corbyn"". One frontbencher said at least people weren't angry with Labour any more. They just weren't particularly inspired either. This, he assessed, was a weird election where people were interested in vaccines and the lifting of restrictions. ""People ask me 'Is the Tory sleaze stuff cutting through?' The honest answer is virtually nothing is cutting through."" Others heap blame on Labour's candidate in Hartlepool - Dr Paul Williams - and how he was chosen. Dr Paul Williams, right, Labour's candidate in Hartlepool, was chosen from a ""list of one"" Selecting an NHS doctor as a candidate amid the Covid crisis seemed like the perfect remedy to Labour's red wall blues.  But first Williams had to apologise for sexist social media posts from a decade ago. Then, the Conservatives accused him of playing a part in decisions that removed services from Hartlepool's hospital, though he pointed to his recent efforts to bring them back. But the means by which Williams was picked has given critics of Starmer's office added ammunition. Williams was chosen from a one-person shortlist. He campaigned for Remain in the referendum and lost in a nearby seat in the last general election. Several Labour MPs - from different wings of the party - are blaming Starmer's political secretary, Baroness Chapman, for the decision. One told us: ""He is her mate but putting him in was a mind boggling decision since Hartlepool is the centre of Planet Brexit."" POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area? VOTE:Why full results might take longer BBC:How to follow the election results The problem for Labour is that Friday's election results suggest Hartlepool is not exceptional. In a range of councils covering areas outside the big metropolitan centres, and where a majority voted for Brexit, Labour has slipped back rather than edging forward. Some majorities were lost but in others - such as Sunderland - they were eroded. One council leader in northern England told us: ""The party nationally is just saying to people 'I'm on your side'. We are not bringing stuff forward to help really transform the lives of people in the North. The party still looks and sounds like a metropolitan, middle class party."" He confided he has raised ""the lack of a message for the North"" with the leadership, but ""it's like banging my head against a brick wall"". Concerns over the apparent lack of a message aren't confined to northern English councillors. An MP who campaigned in Hartlepool and various council contests, had a confession: ""I was hoping you weren't going to ask me to recite precisely what the message is because I think I'd struggle to tell you that. ""This is a fairly bland, vanilla messaging, which seems [aimed at] maximising the minimum number of people who it will offend. What's our plan to unlock the huge potential of the North? That is still a bit of a blank canvas. And that is a bit of a problemâ¦ [I]t doesn't give us the ammunition that people need on the doorstep.""' An MP representing a seat in north-east England put it even more bluntly: ""People think we don't know our arse from our elbow."" So much for the message - what of the messenger himself? Those involved in the election campaigns, from all sides of the party, report Starmer has not made enough impact. Many are understanding and like him. Some praise his move away from the Corbyn era and commend his prime ministerial persona. But they say his image with crucial target voters must improve. ""People get a sense of who Boris is and what he's about,"" said one Yorkshire MP. ""You know they've got the measure of him. The problem with Keir is that people don't have the measure of him yet."" This chimes with the view among some in Starmer's office that the pandemic prevented him - someone who has an interesting backstory and a record of achievement as a lawyer - from being properly introduced to the public. Some of his own MPs believe, though, it's also about leaving a lasting impression. ""He is hugely capable but in the end, politics is not a meritocracy,"" said one, ""and it's not always the best person who prevails. It's a battle of wills and ideologies. We need to up our game.' There are harsher verdicts. An MP who is by no means on the left of the party confesses: ''I just don't know what Keir stands for."" A Labour colleague of theirs from northern England reports this from the doorsteps: 'Where people comment, they think he is boring.' People from across the party are - remarkably - in agreement about the nature of the difficulties. But there's not the same consensus around potential solutions. As Starmer struggles with his electoral mountain, it's like some in the party are shouting ""We need crampons!"" while others say ""Let's crack open the Kendal Mint Cake and take stock of where we are."" Some shadow ministers tell us of difficulties in getting access to the leadership, whether it is to give advice or get ""attack lines"" signed off. They are privately calling for changes to the ""engine room"" - the Leader of the Opposition's office - but can't agree them. Some on the left want Jenny Chapman, once a leading light in the centrist Progress group, removed, and the departure of Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Interestingly, though, a shadow minister not on the left agrees that Starmer needs a chief of staff who can ""really hold things together- a more respected political figure"". Others who want to see changes in Starmer's office believe Chapman and McSweeney have been outstanding for providing direction, and haven't baulked at taking difficult decisions. McSweeney is credited by some for aiding Anas Sarwar to stand as party leader in Scotland, rather than await a potentially poorer result under his predecessor, Richard Leonard. They want different changes among the leader's staff. Sir Keir Starmer will be very well aware of the ""mumbles and grumbles""  - as one of his top team put it - around his leadership. That's why shadow communities secretary Steve Reed was sent round the broadcast studios on Friday morning to assert the problem wasn't Starmer, but the party. And the leader will ""push harder"" to change the party, not vice versa. Insiders say as a reaction to the election results, two things are likely to happen. First, changes in staffing at the Labour HQ, including a strengthening of the communications team. Second, a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.

"Deputy leader Angela Rayner was the campaign co-ordinator for Labour through the local election period Labour's deputy Angela Rayner has been sacked from her roles as party chair and campaign coordinator following poor results in the English local elections. The party lost control of several councils and suffered defeat to the Tories in the Hartlepool by-election. Leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his frontbench team in the next few days. Ms Rayner will remain deputy leader of the party as it is a position directly elected by the party members. She is also expected to be offered another shadow cabinet role. Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool England local elections 2021 in full Labour insiders on what went wrong for Starmer A Labour source said: ""Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections - and he said we need to change. ""That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team."" But Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the decision to sack Ms Rayner was a ""cowardly avoidance of responsibility"" and accused Sir Keir of ""scapegoating everyone apart from himself"". And shadow cabinet source said they were ""totally shocked"", adding, ""everyone is gobsmacked"". Labour's shadow schools ministers Wes Streeting said he had a lot of respect for Ms Rayner adding that she had a ""big responsibility"" along with Sir Keir to ""lead the party to victory at the next general election"". He said it was ""time to take a cold hard look at ourselves to make sure we are changing Labour for the good"". Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke out against Sir Keir's decision to sack Ms Rayner, tweeting: ""I can't support this."" Speaking after hisre-election on Saturday,  Mr Burnham warned that Labour was still too ""London-centric"". Mr Burnham said the party needed to connect with voters differently, and support more powers for English regions. ""I'm getting a bit fed up of saying this to them, but they really do now need to listen and make real changes,"" he added. The results in England contrast to Wales, where Mark Drakeford led Labour to its best performance in elections to the Welsh Parliament, falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. Labour has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Thursday's votes, including council and mayoral elections in England, are Labour's first major test since its crushing defeat at the 2019 general election. Instead of recovering ground, the party suffered a series of setbacks in England, including losing overall control of councils including Durham, Sheffield and Plymouth. The Conservatives also picked up control of several councils, including Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. In former heartland Tees Valley, Laboursuffered a huge defeatto incumbent Tory mayor Ben Houchen, who increased his share of the vote to 73%. But Labour did win mayoral contests in a number of areas, including taking the West of England from the Tories, while retaining others including London, Liverpool, Liverpool City Region, Doncaster and Salford.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   On Saturday, the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour had to do more to listen to voters who had abandoned the party. He added that the party needed to ""accelerate"" changes under Sir Keir's leadership, and would be launching a ""root and branch policy review"". He contrasted the party's performance in England to abetter showing in elections to the Welsh Parliament, where he said as a party in power it had a ""credible, radical policy offer"" to put to voters. Speaking on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had ""lost the trust of working people."" He added the party had ""not made a strong enough case to the country"", but he took responsibility for ""fixing things"". Figures on the left of the party have accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government since taking over as leader last year. Questioned about leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said he loved the job he had just been re-elected to do and that was his priority. He added: ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they needed me one day in the future. But we're not at that day."" The Labour leadership's response to poor results in England will be both political and organisational. There will be a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, and more staff will be moved out of London to regional offices. The policies Sir Keir Starmer inherited from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn will also be formally reviewed. Labour peer Lord Mandelson - who has advised Sir Keir's team - called for this review and envisaged the process running for 18 months to two years. Labour sources say that Sir Keir could use the exercise not just to distance himself  from the 2019 manifesto, but to move away from some of the policy pledges he made in last year's leadership contest - which had been designed to appeal to the party's left. Among those to criticise the party's direction under Sir Keir is Khalid Mahmood, who quit as a shadow defence minister around a month ago. Speaking on Friday, he said Labour had been ""captured"" by a ""London-based bourgeoisie"" and had ""lost touch with ordinary British people"". The Birmingham Perry Barr MP said the party needed to focus on supporting jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, in areas that felt left behind. And former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has beensuspended as a Labour MPunder Sir Keir, said the party needed to present a ""real, radical alternative"". ""Offering nothing, offering insipid support for the government, causes people either to vote for somebody else or simply to stay home and disappear,"" he said.

"Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour.

There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday.

He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

The Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red. Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Meanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists. Voting also took place for four police and crime commissioners, with those votes to be counted on Sunday. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor. In a Tweet, Reeves said she was ""honoured"" to take the role: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labour reshuffle was triggered when Sir Keir Starmersacked Angela Raynerfrom her role as party chair and campaign coordinator, following poor results in the English local elections. She has now been given the role of shadowing Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office, and will also take the titles shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow secretary for the Future of Work An ally of Rayner said: âAngela obviously comes out of this significantly more
powerful both in terms of the party and policy. She will be much more visible
now she isn't being held back. âShe will lead both party reform and the development of a
policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters
we need to win. ""She will set out our vision, develop policy across

as the Labour government in Wales under Mark Drakeford. They have shown the
difference Labour can make in power, standing up for their communities. âWe have
seen Labour begin to turn around its fortunes in Scotland under the leadership
of Anas Sarwar. These results give us optimism and inspiration for the future.
The challenge for us now is to build upon these successes and learn from the
places we lost. âI look
forward to working with our refreshed and renewed team to take on that
challenge, deliver that change and build the ambitious programme that will
deliver the next Labour government.â The leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has re-shuffled some of his

"One of America's largest burger chains is returning to the UK after 20 years with a promise to steal market share from rivals McDonald's and Burger King. Wendy's, famous for square burgers, plans up to 400 outlets nationwide creating at least 12,000 jobs, although that could take many years, it said. Wendy's would still be far smaller than McDonald's, which has 1,300 UK outlets. The firm, which has also agreed a delivery deal with Uber Eats, left the UK complaining of high operating costs. Abigail Pringle, Wendy's chief development officer, said in media interviews over the weekend that with the UK burger and takeaway market growing the time was right for a return. Appetite for McDonald's back at pre-Covid levels Burger King boss warns of UK job cuts And the UK will be used a springboard for growth in the rest of Europe. A statement said: ""The UK launch will spearhead a European-wide expansion as Wendy's looks to build on strong growth on the other side of the Atlantic, where the brand last year dethroned Burger King to become the No 2 player in the US hamburger market."" A typical restaurant employs between 30 to 50 staff, the company said. Wendy's has also promised nozero-hours contractsin a sector much-criticised for its low pay and working conditions. The first Wendy's will open next month, in Reading, followed by Stratford and Oxford, and the company said there will be new items on the menu tailored to the British market, including more vegetarian options. Inside Wendy's planned Reading outlet But Wendy's enters a crowded market that was facing tough times even before lockdown. Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Byron both hit financial trouble and were sold after restructurings. Wendy's said that even if the UK market does not expand as fast as anticipated, it still believes it can take market share from rivals by its emphasis on quality and service. The chain's marketing likes to promote its use of locally sourced products and fresh meat that is not frozen. The chain was founded in 1969 in Ohio and now has 6,800 outlets. It is listed on Wall Street with a valuation of $5bn (Â£3.6bn). Wendy's left the UK in 2001, citing property costs and other overheads that made expansion unviable.

"Avengers star Scarlett Johansson says the body behind the Globes needs ""fundamental reform"" Actor Scarlett Johansson has joined criticism of the body behind the Golden Globe Awards over how it plans to tackle discrimination. Golden Globe organisers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has been accused of a lack of diversity and shadowy workings. Earlier this week the body voted in reforms to widen its membership. But Ms Johansson is among stars and industry figures who say it still needs ""fundamental reform"". The Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile, but organisers have been accused of discriminatory practices, accepting ""freebies"" and other ethical lapses. In February,an exposÃ© in the Los Angeles Times revealed,externalthere were no black people among the organisation's 87 members who vote for the awards. This week, the HFPA outlined a package of reforms to how it works in a bid to make the organisation more inclusive. The Golden Globes is one of the year's biggest and starriest awards ceremonies They include widening its membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members, and hiring diversity advisers. It also said it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules. ""Today's overwhelming vote to reform the Association reaffirms our commitment to change,"" said HFPA president Ali Sar in a statement on Thursday. Many high-profile Hollywood figures have said the initiatives are not good enough. Ms Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes. The 36-year-old recalled facing ""sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment"". Golden Globe award organisers expel former boss Nomadland and Borat win top awards at Globes ""Unless there is necessary fundamental reform within the organization, I believe it is time that we take a step back from the HFPA and focus on the importance and strength of unity within our unions and the industry as a whole,"" she said. Ms Johansson's Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo joined her, writing that the HFPA's reforms were ""discouraging"" in a social media post on Friday. ""Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,"" he said. ""Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.""

Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon studios said they would stop doing business with the HFPA until it goes further with its reform plans. Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos said he was putting their relationship on hold ""until more meaningful changes are made"". Criticism of the HFPA burst into the open in February when the LA Times wrote its exposÃ© detailing alleged ethical conflicts and other misconduct. Following the story, more than 100 Hollywood PR firms threatened to advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA if changes were not made. They accused the organisation of ""discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption"". The same group have said that despite this week's changes it will continue boycotting the HFPA. The HFPA did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"Bruno Fernandes has scored 27 goals for Manchester United in all competitions this season, the most by a Premier League midfielder in a season since Frank Lampard for Chelsea in 2009-10 Manchester United guaranteed a Premier League top-four finish and ensured rivals Manchester City must wait to be crowned champions as they came from behind to beat Aston Villa at Villa Park. Having sealed their place in the Europa League final despite a 3-2 second-legdefeat by Romaon Thursday, second-half goals from Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood and substitute Edinson Cavani - followed by West Ham's loss to Everton - sealed a Champions League place for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side. A win for Villa would have clinched the title for leaders City -beaten 2-1 by Chelseaon Saturday - and Bertrand Traore's emphatic finish into the top corner midway through the first half threatened to do just that. Emiliano Martinez was equal to attempts from Greenwood and Marcus Rashford as United struggled to respond initially, while Dean Henderson kept out Ollie Watkins' strike to deny Villa a second before half-time. United levelled shortly after the restart when Fernandes calmly slotted in a penalty after Douglas Luiz needlessly fouled Paul Pogba, and Greenwood completed a four-minute turnaround when his low strike found the bottom corner. A VAR check for handball against Greenwood was dismissed after Luiz headed the ball onto the arm of the United forward and the visitors successfully resisted late Villa pressure despite the loss of captain Harry Maguire to injury, before Cavani confirmed victory in the closing stages. In a frantic finale, Villa forward Watkins also received a red card for a second booking for simulation when under pressure from goalkeeper Henderson. United are 10 points behind champions-elect City but will have the chance to move within four points as they face Leicester and Liverpool before the leaders next play. 'At least we don't travel back to a party on the Blue side' - Solskjaer happy to delay City title win Follow live text commentary of Sunday's Premier League action This video can not be played Aston Villa 1-3 Man Utd: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praises goalscorer Mason Greenwood With an exhausting short-term schedule to navigate, Solskjaer made four changes from United's midweek trip to Rome for his side's second fixture in a run of four in eight days - a situation created after last weekend's league meeting with Liverpool waspostponed due to fan protests. Henderson, Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Victor Lindelof started at Villa Park, and while Lindelof should have offered greater resistance for Traore's opener, there was little Henderson could do to keep out his fine strike. Solskjaer's side have gone 1-0 down on more occasions (14) than they have gone ahead (13) in the competition this season but, for a Premier League record 10th time in 2020-21, they once again went on to rescue victory. With poacher Cavani benched after scoring twice on Thursday, United initially struggled to test Martinez despite encouraging build-up play. But they were rewarded for a much-improved second-half display, with Fernandes' spot-kick setting the tone for a side totally unfazed by falling behind. Greenwood made his latest claim to be included in Gareth Southgate's European Championship plans with his fifth goal in five Premier League games, though Maguire's early departure following a collision with Anwar El Ghazi will be a concern for both the England boss and Solskjaer. But Cavani's accurate header from Rashford's cross ultimately capped a positive week for United, in which they reached a first final of the Solskjaer era and co-chairman Joel Glazer announced plans for his firstmeaningful discussions with fanssince his family bought the club in 2005. This video can not be played Aston Villa 1-3 Man Utd: 'I think he got shot' - Dean Smith on Paul Pogba penalty incident Victory over an Everton side seeking to keep their European hopes alive last week was further evidence of how far Dean Smith's side have progressed this season, even if results since the turn of the year have dipped. Last term, a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United with four games to go left Villa second-bottom and four points from safety, before they rallied to survive by a single point. Battling on without injured captain Jack Grealish for a 12th successive match, a resolute defence denied United clear chances and Martinez looked comfortable when Greenwood and Rashford offered tests. Traore's lack of defensive support for right-back Matty Cash appeared an early concern as Luke Shaw found joy out wide, but he demonstrated his quality in the opposite half as he spun past Lindelof before unleashing a powerful drive into the far corner. But once Luiz's trip on Pogba allowed United a foothold, Villa faced an uphill task as the visitors made it 22 Premier League visits to Villa Park without defeat. Villa remain 11th and have a top-half finish to aim for in their remaining four matches of a much-improved second season back in the top-flight. Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport:""A great result and it takes a little bit of pressure away from having to get results because the next two [versus Leicester and Liverpool] are against very good teams."" On coming from behind again to win:""It shows character, resilience, belief, fitness. It is difficult at times, especially when you travel back and don't get home until 5am Friday and then travel here. It is a long season and I am delighted for everyone."" Aston Villa boss Dean Smith to BBC Sport:""I didn't think we started the game particularly well. We upped it and then I thought we were good first half, we high pressed well and got a good goal. We were quite comfortable at 1-0 at half-time. I think the game turns on the penalty decision. ""There was a touch but was it enough [for Paul Pogba] to go down? I watched Manchester City last night and Sterling had four touches in his back and doesn't get a penalty and today it is a penalty. This is with Stockley Park watching in slow motion so you tell me what is happening because I don't think the football world actually understands it anymore."" Manchester United have won 10 Premier League matches after conceding first this season, a record by a team in a single season in the competition. They have also recovered 31 points from losing positions, with only Newcastle United in 2001-02 recovering more in a single Premier League season (34). United are unbeaten in their last 25 Premier League away games, with those 25 games coming in Bruno Fernandes' first 25 away Premier League appearances for the club. Mason Greenwood scored his 16th Premier League goal, the most of any teenager for the club, overtaking Wayne Rooney's tally of 15. Edinson Cavani netted his fifth Premier League goal as a substitute this season, equalling the record of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 1998-99 and Javier Hernandez in 2010-11. Harry Maguire ended a run of 71 consecutive Premier League matches for Manchester United in which he completed 90 minutes - the joint-longest run alongside Gary Pallister between 1993 and 1995. Aston Villa have lost eight home Premier League matches this season. Only Sheffield United (13) and Fulham (11) have lost more. Bertrand Traore is the first player to score home and away against Manchester United and lose both games in a Premier League season since Robin van Persie in 2011-12. Manchester United host Leicester City on Tuesday at 18:00 BST, before welcoming Liverpool to Old Trafford on Thursday (20:15).

"Mark Drakeford is expected to be reappointed as First Minister Welsh Labour is looking poised to go it alone and form a government without help from other parties. Thursday's Senedd election left Labour with 30 seats - one short of an outright majority. But a senior figure said the party could continue to run the Cardiff government without a deal signed with opposition politicians. Labour minister Jeremy Miles said the result allowed them to work with parties on a ""case-by-case basis"". Party leader Mark Drakeford also said Labour has governed successfully on 30 seats before. With no significant challenge from the opposition to his position Mr Drakeford is expected to be reappointed to his job as first minister. However, he may in future need help from the opposition to pass laws and get Labour's spending plans through the Welsh Parliament, with one seat short of a majority. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales: ""We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us."" ""I'm always much more interested in policy agreements that I am in a sort of political fixing."" He added: ""No party has a monopoly of good ideas, and where there are things that we can work on together, then my administration will certainly look to do that with anybody who thinks that we can work to the advantage of Wales."" Drakeford says Covid response kept Wales Labour PM calls devolution summit after Labour Senedd win What's the secret behind Labour's success in Wales? First woman of colour elected to Welsh Parliament The Welsh government ruled in a minority from 2011 to 2016, striking deals with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru at various points to pass budgets. Neath member of the Senedd (MS) Mr Miles said there were ""precedents where we have successfully been able to negotiate budget agreements, legislative arrangements on a case-by-case basis with other parties"". ""I think the mathematics of this Senedd, the response that the people of Wales have given, allows for that range of possibilities,"" he told the Sunday Supplement programme on BBC Radio Wales. In the last Welsh government Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams served as education minister. Jane Dodds, the Welsh Lib Dem leader elected as their only MS this time, has ruled out joining the Welsh government. She told the Dewi Llwyd ar Bore Sul programme on BBC Radio Cymru: ""I'm not expecting [an invite to join the government] and I don't want it to tell you the truth."" ""I don't have the experience of being in the Senedd. Kirsty had 15 or 16 years in the Senedd before she had a chance to be in the cabinet."" Mark Drakeford is in no rush. Having led Labour to a record-equalling tally of seats, he is not under pressure within the party. But tough times lie ahead. The pandemic is not over. The outlook is uncertain. In those circumstances, haggling over votes, lurching from deal to deal, is not an appealing prospect. That's why Mr Drakeford is sounding conciliatory. He wants stability in the Senedd and, if there is not to be a formal coalition, he must co-operate with opponents. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies saw the party's seats increase from 11 to 16 - the Tories' best-ever result, although far short of the numbers needed to govern. Mr Davies said: ""We've got the best result we've ever had in the assembly, nearly 50% more members returning, a new generation of Conservatives, the first lady coming to the assembly from an ethnic minority as well."" He told BBC Radio Wales he would like the next term's presiding officer (PO) - who chairs meetings and is a figurehead for the Welsh Parliament - to be from his party. ""I think it is important to reflect on the success of the Conservatives in this election, and give consideration to maybe a Conservative PO or DPO (deputy presiding officer),"" he said. ""I do think that from a consensual point of view, I think a progressive move would be to offer that consideration around a Conservative appointment."" Plaid Cymru came third at the election. Although its overall seat tally rose by two, it lost its prized constituency seat of the Rhondda in the south Wales valleys. The party's leader Adam Price told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement it was a ""disappointing result"" for Plaid Cymru electorally and a ""bitter blow"" in the Rhondda. But he said there were ""many positives"". He said Plaid Cymru had ""opened up the space for the Labour Party, and Mark Drakeford himself, probably, to take up a much more radical line on the constitution"". ""This is an election which actually has strengthened belief in Welsh self-government and in Welsh democracy,"" he added. Last night Prime Minister Boris Johnsoninvited the first ministers of Scotland and Wales to a summiton how ""Team UK"" can recover from the pandemic and face other ""shared challenges"". Welsh Labour Housing minister Julie James said she welcomed the invitation to a meeting if it was ""real"". She told the BBC's Politics Wales programme: ""We've been calling for many many years for a proper constitutional summit, where we talk properly about the role of devolution across the UK.""

"This video can not be played Natasha Asghar said she hopes to see people from more diverse backgrounds in Welsh politics. The first woman of colour elected to the Welsh Parliament said she wants to inspire and be ""a voice"" for those who have faced barriers entering politics. Conservative MS Natasha Asghar said the Senedd is ""very outdated"" and should reflect ""more diverse communities that truly represent Wales"". The new South Wales East member, whose late father was a Senedd member, wants to ""inspire"" others to follow suit. It comes as less women have been elected to the Welsh Parliament. Wales was the first country in the world to have a gender equal parliament in 2003, but now 26 women - out of 60  - will be the new Welsh Parliament. Drakeford says Covid response kept Wales Labour How the Welsh Parliamentary election was won Labour's road to Welsh victory in numbers Campaigners have said the fall in female Senedd members is a ""step back for equality"" as after Thursday'selection the number of female Members of the Senedd dropped from 29. Ms Asghar, from Newport, follows in the footsteps of her late fatherMohammad Asghar who died in 2020, who was the first ethnic minority member of the Senedd and also represented South Wales East. She is not only the first woman of colour from Wales to have been elected to a seat in the Welsh Parliament but also in the House of Commons and European Parliament too. Her election comes as the first woman of colour was alsoelected to the Scottish Parliament in its 22-year history. Mohammad Asghar represented the South Wales East region for 13 years before he died last year ""We have no real political influential women of colour in Wales and I am honoured beyond comprehension to be the first one,"" she said. Ms Asghar said the Senedd was ""still very outdated when it came to representation"" and it needed to reflect ""more diverse communities that truly represent Wales"". ""I want to inspire the young men and women that it is doable, it can be achieved, and I hope to be a platform to get to where I am, if not go further,"" she added. Kirsty Williams, Wales' former education minister and MS of 22 years, stood down at the election While campaigners and political leaders welcomed the historic moment, calls have been made for action to increase diversity in the Welsh Parliament. In Wales, 43% of MSs elected on Thursday were women, this compares to 34% of MPs elected to UK Parliament at the 2019 general election and 37% at the outgoing Scottish Parliament.

Before the elections women held 48% of seats in the Welsh Parliament, with 29 female MSs and 31 men - of the party leaders, all of them were male. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in during the parliament term. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. Sarah Murphy, new member of the Senedd for Bridgend, was one of 17 Labour Senedd members elected A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down before Thursday's election, following the vote, all of their seats are now held by men. In the Vale of Clwyd, where Labour's Ann Jones also stepped down after 22 years, Labour fielded a male candidate, but the seat was taken by Gareth Davies of the Conservatives. Former Education Secretary Kirsty Williams's Brecon and Radnorshire seat, held since 1999 by the Liberal Democrat MS, was won by Tory candidate James Evans, beating the Lib Dems candidate William Powell. Meanwhile,Angela Burns' old Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire seatwas held by the Tories, with the party's Samuel Kurtz elected to the Senedd. Labour were the only party to see a constituency seat formerly held by a man held by a woman New Labour MS Sarah Murphy in Bridgend was the only female to take a constituency seat from a man, after former Labour first minister Carwyn Jones did not stand for re-election. The largest party, Labour, now has 17 female Senedd members out of their 30 seats while Plaid Cymru has five (out of 13) and the Conservatives three (out of 16). While Jane Dodds is not just the only Liberal Democrat candidate to win a seat in the Senedd but also the only female party leader in Wales. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Cerys Furlong, of gender quality charity Chwarae Teg, said parties had been ""warned repeatedly that more needed to be done"" to ensure diverse candidates were in winnable seats. ""We know what the barriers to greater diversity in politics are, it's high time action was taken to address them,"" she said. She called for an introduction of quotas, and more initiatives to help people to stand for election, like job shares for parents. 'Impossible' to be a politician and raise a family Wales councillor 'screamed at because of age' Abuse 'reality of being black' - Gething ""For too long we have heard warm words about the need to deliver greater diversity in our politics, but not only have we not made progress, the number of women has actually fallen,"" she added. ""Wales deserves a Senedd that reflects our diverse communities and our newly elected Senedd has a responsibility to make that a reality"". Jess Blair, of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), said the decrease in gender equality showed ""how risky it is to leave diversity up to parties"". She added some regions had been at risk of having no women representing them on the list in the Senedd. ""From 2003, where Wales was the first country to achieve a 50:50 gender balanced parliament, this is a huge backwards step,"" she said. ""It is obvious that we need to introduce statutory measures such a gender quotas, linked to a more proportional electoral system, to ensure that gender equality doesn't slip back further"". Political consultancy Deryn said more ""positive action"" was needed to deliver equality in Welsh politics and parties needed to ""think again"". Cathy Owens, of Deryn, said Welsh Labour had reintroduced all women shortlists, but Plaid had lost key seats held by women. ""The Conservatives continue to have a terrible record of representation,"" she said. ""It is great that the Conservatives have the first woman of colour in the Senedd, but they need to start taking action now to ensure that their slate of candidates at the next election is more representative of the communities they serve. Ms Asghar, who has worked in media and finance, said there had been a ""lack of knowledge"" within her own community about how to get involved in politics, when asked about why she thought the Welsh Conservatives was mostly white and male. She spoke of following in the footsteps of her father, adding: ""He always said to me, 'Natasha I'm blessed by god to be the first member, I pry to god that I'm not the last'... and I'm delighted that's not been the case since."" Three of the four new South Wales East MS's are women, with Cons Natasha Asghar, Plaid's Delyth Jewell and Cons Laura Anne Jones elected ""There's been more men, I understand from different parties, I'm the first woman of colour...it's progress,"" she said.

"Overshadowed by the Tories - Sir Keir Starmer on Friday morning, as the election picture unfolded Ever since his election as Labour leader a year ago Sir Keir Starmer has emphasised that the party has an electoral mountain to climb. He conquered the foothills pretty quickly - stressing new leadership and even suspending the former leader. The early emphasis was on eliminating negatives - in particular the stain of anti-Semitism. As long as the new leader continued making steady if slow progress, most of the internal grumbling - or downright opposition - was likely to be limited to the party's left. And not even all of them. But slipping back down the mountain has led to nervousness, and restlessness among those he leads. Starmer faced his first electoral test on Thursday with the Hartlepool by-election. It is a seat Labour has held since it was created in 1974, and defended even as its other red wall constituencies fell in 2019. But, by Friday morning the coastal town in North East England, had switched to Boris Johnson's Conservatives. Insiders say the party performed worse than its internal polling had suggested on Thursday - anditwasn't very positive. But it wasn't the only significant loss. There was Harlow council in Essex, and in Sunderland it lost ground. While the pandemic has blunted Starmer's ability to oppose the government outright, some who supported his leadership are wondering why he is stumbling in much more favourable political weather when it should have been the government that was on the back foot, over ""sleaze"". One of them told us that Starmer's task now, is ""to incinerate the politics of the far left"". Meanwhile some on the left are calling for ""radical change"". The majority in Hartlepool was always vulnerable. The last time this parliamentary seat was fought, in 2019, the now-defunct Brexit Party took more than 10,000 votes. Many of these were looking for a new home. But it raises questions over Labour's approach. Sir Keir Starmer has stressed his patriotism and accepted the Brexit deal. Yet that doesn't seem to have been enough to detoxify the party's image among some former Labour, pro-Brexit voters. But there were other factors. A prominent politician who spent some time campaigning in Hartlepool blamed the hollowing out of the party during the Corbyn era, with strong organisational, as much as political expertise and experience, lost. Another, who spent a lot of time on the town's doorsteps, said the party was afflicted by the phenomenon of ""long Corbyn"". One frontbencher said at least people weren't angry with Labour any more. They just weren't particularly inspired either. This, he assessed, was a weird election where people were interested in vaccines and the lifting of restrictions. ""People ask me 'Is the Tory sleaze stuff cutting through?' The honest answer is virtually nothing is cutting through."" Others heap blame on Labour's candidate in Hartlepool - Dr Paul Williams - and how he was chosen. Dr Paul Williams, right, Labour's candidate in Hartlepool, was chosen from a ""list of one"" Selecting an NHS doctor as a candidate amid the Covid crisis seemed like the perfect remedy to Labour's red wall blues.  But first Williams had to apologise for sexist social media posts from a decade ago. Then, the Conservatives accused him of playing a part in decisions that removed services from Hartlepool's hospital, though he pointed to his recent efforts to bring them back. But the means by which Williams was picked has given critics of Starmer's office added ammunition. Williams was chosen from a one-person shortlist. He campaigned for Remain in the referendum and lost in a nearby seat in the last general election. Several Labour MPs - from different wings of the party - are blaming Starmer's political secretary, Baroness Chapman, for the decision. One told us: ""He is her mate but putting him in was a mind boggling decision since Hartlepool is the centre of Planet Brexit."" POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area? VOTE:Why full results might take longer BBC:How to follow the election results The problem for Labour is that Friday's election results suggest Hartlepool is not exceptional. In a range of councils covering areas outside the big metropolitan centres, and where a majority voted for Brexit, Labour has slipped back rather than edging forward. Some majorities were lost but in others - such as Sunderland - they were eroded. One council leader in northern England told us: ""The party nationally is just saying to people 'I'm on your side'. We are not bringing stuff forward to help really transform the lives of people in the North. The party still looks and sounds like a metropolitan, middle class party."" He confided he has raised ""the lack of a message for the North"" with the leadership, but ""it's like banging my head against a brick wall"". Concerns over the apparent lack of a message aren't confined to northern English councillors. An MP who campaigned in Hartlepool and various council contests, had a confession: ""I was hoping you weren't going to ask me to recite precisely what the message is because I think I'd struggle to tell you that. ""This is a fairly bland, vanilla messaging, which seems [aimed at] maximising the minimum number of people who it will offend. What's our plan to unlock the huge potential of the North? That is still a bit of a blank canvas. And that is a bit of a problemâ¦ [I]t doesn't give us the ammunition that people need on the doorstep.""' An MP representing a seat in north-east England put it even more bluntly: ""People think we don't know our arse from our elbow."" So much for the message - what of the messenger himself? Those involved in the election campaigns, from all sides of the party, report Starmer has not made enough impact. Many are understanding and like him. Some praise his move away from the Corbyn era and commend his prime ministerial persona. But they say his image with crucial target voters must improve. ""People get a sense of who Boris is and what he's about,"" said one Yorkshire MP. ""You know they've got the measure of him. The problem with Keir is that people don't have the measure of him yet."" This chimes with the view among some in Starmer's office that the pandemic prevented him - someone who has an interesting backstory and a record of achievement as a lawyer - from being properly introduced to the public. Some of his own MPs believe, though, it's also about leaving a lasting impression. ""He is hugely capable but in the end, politics is not a meritocracy,"" said one, ""and it's not always the best person who prevails. It's a battle of wills and ideologies. We need to up our game.' There are harsher verdicts. An MP who is by no means on the left of the party confesses: ''I just don't know what Keir stands for."" A Labour colleague of theirs from northern England reports this from the doorsteps: 'Where people comment, they think he is boring.' People from across the party are - remarkably - in agreement about the nature of the difficulties. But there's not the same consensus around potential solutions. As Starmer struggles with his electoral mountain, it's like some in the party are shouting ""We need crampons!"" while others say ""Let's crack open the Kendal Mint Cake and take stock of where we are."" Some shadow ministers tell us of difficulties in getting access to the leadership, whether it is to give advice or get ""attack lines"" signed off. They are privately calling for changes to the ""engine room"" - the Leader of the Opposition's office - but can't agree them. Some on the left want Jenny Chapman, once a leading light in the centrist Progress group, removed, and the departure of Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Interestingly, though, a shadow minister not on the left agrees that Starmer needs a chief of staff who can ""really hold things together- a more respected political figure"". Others who want to see changes in Starmer's office believe Chapman and McSweeney have been outstanding for providing direction, and haven't baulked at taking difficult decisions. McSweeney is credited by some for aiding Anas Sarwar to stand as party leader in Scotland, rather than await a potentially poorer result under his predecessor, Richard Leonard. They want different changes among the leader's staff. Sir Keir Starmer will be very well aware of the ""mumbles and grumbles""  - as one of his top team put it - around his leadership. That's why shadow communities secretary Steve Reed was sent round the broadcast studios on Friday morning to assert the problem wasn't Starmer, but the party. And the leader will ""push harder"" to change the party, not vice versa. Insiders say as a reaction to the election results, two things are likely to happen. First, changes in staffing at the Labour HQ, including a strengthening of the communications team. Second, a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. A long-standing Labour MP told me that would be a ""wily move [helping] stifle criticism in the wake of the elections, as who is going to speak out if they think their job is at risk?"" Tony Blair and ""big figures"" Gordon Brown and Robin Cook (second and third from left), and Jack Straw (second from right) There is a feeling that many shadow ministers haven't made enough impact collectively or, in some cases, individually. One frontbencher pointed to some of the ""big figures"" when Labour was in opposition in the 1990s - Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, Jack Straw - and said Starmer needed five or six ""star players"" in the top team. ""There will be no leadership challenge,"" a leading left-winger told us. This is partly due to there being no agreement on who a challenger would be. A prominent colleague of his on the left predicted that if Starmer were to go, it would be due to private pressure from those on the other wing of the party. But installing - for want of a better description - an anti-Corbyn, or more centrist leader, without a contest wouldn't be straightforward.  Not least because the current deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who is popular among members and seen as more left-wing than Starmer, would stand. This might mean putsch wouldn't come to shove. There do not seem to be fully fledged leadership campaigns, but there is a great deal of chatter. A frontbench supporter of Starmer believes he is safe for now and that the shadow cast by the pandemic has been a long one. But once it dissipates, this backer said ""if we are no further forward in a year's time he is in trouble - we could be just a year away from an election"". Some on what is seen as the party's ""soft left"" are pondering a return to Westminster for Andy Burnham, despite his likely re-election as mayor of Greater Manchester on Friday. Some say they would urge him to consider another tilt at the leadership if the polls haven't improved in the new year. Others are suggesting Yvette Cooper should offer herself as - at the very least - a caretaker leader, taking the party into the next election campaign. Starmer doesn't want to be bogged down by too much baggage as he tries to climb his electoral mountain. So he won't be spending the summer writing an election manifesto. But Lord Mandelson, a leading light in the Tony Blair's New Labour movement, has told the BBC it istime to conduct a policy review, to thin out the bulky 2019 manifesto, and, in the process, develop ideas that may be attractive to target voters. Policy workhas been going on under the radarbut internal critics say it lacks definition. And there is a danger that each solution simply brings another problem. An analysis by the former shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, suggests as Starmer tries to woo former voters by stressing his patriotism, he is inadvertently encouraging some more radical, middle class supporters, including former Corbyn supporters, to defect to the Greens. Indeed, early results show Labour losing some council wards in north-east England to Green candidates. Though this exodus isn't huge, it could - he argues - cost the party marginal Westminster seats in the North. Trickett told the BBC ""the public have put the leadership on notice"". He has research suggesting many voters in seats that turned blue in 2019 actually share -economically if not culturally - left-wing values, such as agreeing the state should narrow wealth inequalities welfare should be more generous and that corporate greed was a problem. But a shadow minister, not on the left of the party, said: ""Boris Johnson is occupying so much of our territory. He has actually paid people not to go out to work. The state-run NHS has delivered his vaccination programme."" And at a virtual seminar for Labour-supporting business figures, a prominent pollster told the audience that the party's (likely) success in London was a double-edged sword. The pollster argued it simply reinforced the perception that Labour was no longer for once-traditional voters in Northern towns. That perception - rather than policies - was proving a near impenetrable problem. These difficulties transcend personalities and would provide a challenge for any leader. But for now it is Starmer and his team who must devise a means of addressing them.

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor. In a Tweet, Reeves said she was ""honoured"" to take the role: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labour reshuffle was triggered when Sir Keir Starmersacked Angela Raynerfrom her role as party chair and campaign coordinator, following poor results in the English local elections. She has now been given the role of shadowing Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office, and will also take the titles shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow secretary for the Future of Work An ally of Rayner said: âAngela obviously comes out of this significantly more
powerful both in terms of the party and policy. She will be much more visible
now she isn't being held back. âShe will lead both party reform and the development of a
policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters
we need to win. ""She will set out our vision, develop policy across
the board and lead the fight to win back voters across former Labour heartlands

seen Labour begin to turn around its fortunes in Scotland under the leadership
of Anas Sarwar. These results give us optimism and inspiration for the future.
The challenge for us now is to build upon these successes and learn from the
places we lost. âI look
forward to working with our refreshed and renewed team to take on that
challenge, deliver that change and build the ambitious programme that will
deliver the next Labour government.â The leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has re-shuffled some of his

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says it would be ""absurd"" if things ever got close to the point of taking the SNP to court. Scotland's first minister has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a second independence referendum is ""a matter of when - not if"". Nicola Sturgeon spoke directly with Mr Johnson for the first time since the SNP won an emphatic victory in Thursday's Holyrood election. Earlier, Ms Sturgeon said she did not expect the debate to end up in court. A senior UK government minister appeared to suggest it would not mount a legal challenge to her plans. During a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday afternoon, the first minister pledged to work with the UK government on steering the country through the Covid pandemic towards recovery. Scottish election 2021: Results in maps and charts How the newspapers reacted in Scotland The SNP said the leaders also agreed the importance of both governments working together ""closely and constructively"" to make the forthcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow a success. But a party spokeswoman added: ""The FM also re-iterated her intention to ensure that the people of Scotland can choose our own future when the crisis is over, and made clear that the question of a referendum is now a matter of when - not if."" Boris Johnson has invited Ms Sturgeon to a summit on a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic The UK Government said Mr Johnson spoke to the first minister to ""congratulate her on her party's success"" in the Scottish Parliament election. A spokesman said the prime minister emphasised ""the importance of focusing on Covid recovery at this time"". He added: ""They both agreed that their immediate focus should be on working together to build back from the pandemic. ""The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation for the first minister to join a summit meeting to discuss our shared challenges on Covid recovery and how we can overcome them."" Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned whether she would introduce a referendum bill as early as next spring based on predictions that the UK will have recovered in terms of coronavirus circulation and GDP. She said: ""That would certainly work for that timescale of within the first half of the parliamentary term. ""I desperately hope those predictions are correct but we have to judge that as we go through this year. We've still got significant challenges ahead. I wouldn't rule that out but I'm not sitting here saying that is the timescale."" Mr Johnson earlier invited Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford to a summit to discuss a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic. He has said it would be ""reckless and irresponsible"" to have a referendum right now, and the UK government is not currently expected to grant formal consent for a vote to be held - as it did ahead of the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon congratulated five of the SNP's new MSPs on Sunday morning There has been speculation that the row could end up with the courts being asked to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a referendum without the UK government's agreement. But Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe either side wanted a legal battle over the issue. She said: ""The UK government knows that if we ever get into a situation where this is being determined in the courts then actually what the UK government is arguing is that there is no democratic route for Scotland to have independence. ""The implications of that would be very grave indeed. If the argument of the unionist side is that Scotland is trapped it strikes me that that is one of the strongest arguments for independence.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Ms Sturgeon also said it would be ""absurd and completely outrageous"" if the UK government went to court over the issue and that it was ""up to the Scottish people"" to decide the country's future. Her party stood on a manifesto to steer the country out of the pandemic, and to then hold a referendum, which she said people had ""voted overwhelmingly for"". She added: ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" Also appearing on the programme, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he would ""not go near"" the issue of the UK government potentially challenging a referendum bill in court. He said: ""Whatever parties we come from, the priority at the moment is not court cases, it's not independence legislation - it is recovery from the pandemic."" When asked if Scotland was allowed to leave the UK, he said: ""Of course it is, through a legal referendum which would allow people to make that choice."" But he also insisted that the SNP's failure to win an overall majority showed that the people of Scotland were not ""agitating"" for a referendum. The SNP finished on 64 seats in Thursday's Scottish election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016 - while the Conservatives won 31, Labour 22, the pro-independence Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. But Mr Gove said a majority of voters - 51% - had backed parties that were opposed to independence in the constituency ballot - although the same percentage voted for pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove appeared on Marr during a visit to Scotland BBC Scotland's Sunday Show later asked Mr Gove to clarify the indication he gave to Marr that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove said: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principal focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denied he was giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill, saying ""we are concentrating on recovery at the moment"". In her victory speech, Ms Sturgeon said her priority was leading the country through the pandemic - but said she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. In aletter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night, the prime minister invited Ms Sturgeon to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility.""

The victim was a 53-year-old Vietnamese woman who had underlying medical problems, including diabetes, state media reported. Infections have rocketed in the country of seven million since last month, when the worst surges also began in neighbouring Thailand and Cambodia. Laos has still identified only 1,302 infections since the pandemic began.  US President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July The US is ""turning the corner"" on the pandemic, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients has said. But he also stressed the importance of all Americans getting vaccinated. Speaking to CNN,external, Zients said 58% of adult Americans had received at least one dose, while more than 110 million had been fully vaccinated. Asked about the vaccination rate slowing down and how hesitant groups were being targeted, Zients said: ""We want everyone to get vaccinated and we have enough supply for all adults Americans to get vaccinated. We just want to make it easier and easier for people to get vaccinated. ""And for those who do have questions about efficacy or about safety, the three authorised vaccines are all very safe and very effective, so we want people to be able to turn to their trusted leader in their neighbourhood - their doctor, their faith leader - to get information about the vaccines, to build vaccine confidence so all Americans get vaccinated."" US President Joe Biden haslaid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 Julyand roll out the shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. In the Philippines, a second surge in Covid-19 cases is putting renewed pressure on the healthcare system. The country currently has the second highest number of cases in South East Asia behind Indonesia. And with one of the longest and hardest lockdowns in the world, a crippling recession has forced thousands on to the streets in search of food. Howard Johnson reports. This video can not be played Philippines Covid surge throws country into disarray The EU has not renewed its order for AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine beyond June, the bloc's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has said. The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech as reliable partners that deliver on their commitments. Read more here on why the EU is suing AstraZeneca. The UK has recorded another two Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There were also a further 1,770 cases reported on Sunday, according tothe government's dashboard,external. Vaccinations continued with 607,864 total jabs on Saturday - 169,027 were first doses while 438,837 were second doses. Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Chelsea and Man City will meet each other in the Champions League Final Scientists on the Independent Sage committee have called for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea to be moved to the UK from Turkey to reduce Covid risks. The final is due to take place in Istanbul on 29 May. But the UK government this week said fans of both clubsshould not travel to Turkeyfor the final after it was added to England's travel red list.

New Zealand health officials have cleared the way for quarantine-free flights to resume to Sydney after fears of a Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales eased. Flights were suspended on Thursday after two people in Sydney tested positive for the virus. It was the third disruption since the quarantine-free travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia opened on 18 April, almost 400 days after both closed their international borders due to the pandemic. The earlier stoppages to flights to and from Western Australia lasted only a few days and the current travel pause with New South Wales would end at midnight on Sunday. ""The current assessment from New Zealand public health officials is that the risk to New Zealand from New South Wales remains low,"" the health ministry said in a statement. The US has administered some 250 million doses of vaccines to its population, more than 75 doses per 100 people.It's one of the world's most successful vaccination programmes, with President Joe Biden aiming to vaccinate 70% of the country by 4 July. But demand for doses seems to be slowing, and the rate of vaccination is plummeting. According to the Associated Press,states across the US are asking for fewer and fewer jabs,externalfrom the federal government, causing a growing stockpile of vaccines. Doses are allocated by population size, and state governments can then request how many they want each week. Iowa has asked for 29% of its allocated doses; Connecticut 26%; South Carolina 21%; and Iowa and Wisconsin just 9% and 8%, respectively. Last week President Biden said his administration was working to win over ""doubters"" about the shots.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked About seven million Germans are fully vaccinated Both the EU and UK have seen heated debates on whether or not to let people who have had the jab do more than those who have not. From Sunday, everyone in Germany who has been fully vaccinated is now exempt from many restrictions across the country, according to new legislation there. There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses. But they'll still have to observe social distancing rules and wear a mask on public transport. The EU has already announced plans for a vaccine passport - known as a digital green certificate - which will cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered. Until that comes into force though, Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller has advised Germans to carry proof of vaccination - otherwise it will be ""damn difficult to check"" if they were exempt from rules or not, AFP news agency reported. South Africa has confirmed four cases of a new Covid variant that first appeared in India. All four were people who had a history of travel to India. They were found in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The health ministry said 11 cases of the UK variant B.1.1.7 have also been detected. South Africa is the hardest hit nation on the continent, recording more infections and deaths than any other country there.

A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams.

The victim was a 53-year-old Vietnamese woman who had underlying medical problems, including diabetes, state media reported. Infections have rocketed in the country of seven million since last month, when the worst surges also began in neighbouring Thailand and Cambodia. Laos has still identified only 1,302 infections since the pandemic began.  US President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July The US is ""turning the corner"" on the pandemic, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients has said. But he also stressed the importance of all Americans getting vaccinated. Speaking to CNN,external, Zients said 58% of adult Americans had received at least one dose, while more than 110 million had been fully vaccinated. Asked about the vaccination rate slowing down and how hesitant groups were being targeted, Zients said: ""We want everyone to get vaccinated and we have enough supply for all adults Americans to get vaccinated. We just want to make it easier and easier for people to get vaccinated. ""And for those who do have questions about efficacy or about safety, the three authorised vaccines are all very safe and very effective, so we want people to be able to turn to their trusted leader in their neighbourhood - their doctor, their faith leader - to get information about the vaccines, to build vaccine confidence so all Americans get vaccinated."" US President Joe Biden haslaid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 Julyand roll out the shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. In the Philippines, a second surge in Covid-19 cases is putting renewed pressure on the healthcare system. The country currently has the second highest number of cases in South East Asia behind Indonesia. And with one of the longest and hardest lockdowns in the world, a crippling recession has forced thousands on to the streets in search of food. Howard Johnson reports. This video can not be played Philippines Covid surge throws country into disarray The EU has not renewed its order for AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine beyond June, the bloc's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has said. The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech as reliable partners that deliver on their commitments. Read more here on why the EU is suing AstraZeneca. The UK has recorded another two Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There were also a further 1,770 cases reported on Sunday, according tothe government's dashboard,external. Vaccinations continued with 607,864 total jabs on Saturday - 169,027 were first doses while 438,837 were second doses. Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice.

"Caroline Lucas and Sian Berry share a joke on the campaign trail The joy of a buffet of elections is being able to graze on the details that emerge beyond the main headlines - the political afters while most people are gorging on the main course. So, let's take a look at how the Green Party did in Thursday's polls. Or should I say, green parties. Others are poring over the pivotal role the Scottish Greens are likely to play in the coming years in the Scottish Parliament, given they serve up Nicola Sturgeon with a majority in favour of another independence referendum,which the SNP didn't manage on its own. But what about the Green Party of England and Wales? Sir John Curtice: What the results mean for the parties Scottish Greens win record eight Holyrood seats Sadiq Khan wins second term as London mayor No such power-broking for them on the national stage, but some fascinating trends to take a peek at. The party has gained more than 80 council seats so far. We should be clear: that's a rise from a very small number, to a slightly bigger small number. But then there are mayoral races. In Bristol, the Greensgave Labour a run for its money, and finished second. ""The Green Party is one of the two main parties in this city,"" said the party's candidate, Sandy Hore-Ruthven. Sian Berry, the party's co-leader and candidate for Mayor of London, tweeted a video with delight celebrating her ""really strong third place"". She managed just shy of 200,000 first-preference votes, double her party's total in 2012. Bluntly, though, politics is a pursuit where you are either a winner, or one of the losers. So does any of this matter? Politics is also about building momentum, and fighting for attention. If you get labelled as ""other,"" an amorphous blob of minnows, that is rather hard. Molly Scott Cato says voters are facing up to the climate crisis So little wonder Jonathan Bartley, the party's co-leader alongside Sian Berry,suggested it should be their party,externalrather than the Liberal Democrats, that found itself invited on to a television sofa this weekend to mull over the results. The Lib Dems have 11 times as many MPs - Caroline Lucas is still the Greens' sole representative on the green Commons benches - and more than four times as many councillors in England, but the Greens claim to have more mojo, movement and growth. The BBC's elections supremo. Professor Sir John Curtice says: ""These local elections appear to confirm that the Greens are now able to win a non-trivial proportion of the vote."" Please refresh your browser But is this any more than the ebb and flow of election cycles? Or is it indicative of some sort of trend? In a typicallypugnacious post on social media,external, former Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said: ""The way broadcasters are almost entirely ignoring the frankly astonishing gains by the Green Party is the best indicator to those who want real change and to challenge the establishment that they should always vote Green."" I called her with a mild sense of trepidation (incidentally, Jonathan Bartley had been on Newsnight and Sian Berry talked to Huw Edwards on the BBC's election special, but we'll let that go). The Green Party's performance at this set of elections was down to three factors, Ms Scott Cato told me. ""People are facing up to the climate crisis, which we've been thinking about for decades,"" she said. There was also ""disillusionment with Labour"" and, finally, ""the shoe leather thing"", as she put it. ""You do find people who say they are Green voters. But you don't find anyone who says, 'My granddad voted Green.'"" In other words, if there is any tradition to voting Green, it doesn't run very deep. The party has to scrap and harry for every single vote. Ms Scott Cato reckons that makes the Greens distinctive, where others may be more complacent about at least something of a core vote. German Green leader Annalena Baerbock is front-page news Let's dig a little deeper. Who is voting Green, and where? And how much of this points to evidence of a splintering on the Left, where, in very broad terms, Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Greens are all chasing voters who lean in that direction, leaving the Conservatives with a near monopoly for those who lean to the Right? ""The party's performance overlapped with Labour's, with the strongest Green showings in areas with the most graduates and professionals,"" writes Professor Rob Ford of Manchester Universityin the Observer,external. Professor Matthew Goodwin, of the University of Kent,takes the argument further in The Sunday Times,external. ""The quietly impressive performance by the Greens this week is a big hint that we may well be heading in the same direction as our European neighbours, such as Germany, where cosmopolitan parties are eclipsing the old centre-left."" He adds: ""Fast forward 10 years and I'd not be surprised to see the Greens or the Lib Dems as a much bigger force, rallying zoomer graduates, middle-class professionals and city-dwellers in the face of a Labour Party that looks bewildered and lost."" Plenty of parties have been assumed by some to be on the brink of death, only to revive themselves. George Dangerfield wrote a book called The Strange Death of Liberal England, in 1935. Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote a book called The Strange Death of Tory England, in 2005. Others have been talked up, as the Greens have before, only to tread water or shrivel. Predicting what might happen in politics is a brave game, which is what makes it so fascinating to observe. The Green Party of England and Wales remains a tiddler, but there is evidence it is growing, and growing in confidence.

"Mark Drakeford is expected to be reappointed as First Minister Welsh Labour is looking poised to go it alone and form a government without help from other parties. Thursday's Senedd election left Labour with 30 seats - one short of an outright majority. But a senior figure said the party could continue to run the Cardiff government without a deal signed with opposition politicians. Labour minister Jeremy Miles said the result allowed them to work with parties on a ""case-by-case basis"". Party leader Mark Drakeford also said Labour has governed successfully on 30 seats before. With no significant challenge from the opposition to his position Mr Drakeford is expected to be reappointed to his job as first minister. However, he may in future need help from the opposition to pass laws and get Labour's spending plans through the Welsh Parliament, with one seat short of a majority. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales: ""We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us."" ""I'm always much more interested in policy agreements that I am in a sort of political fixing."" He added: ""No party has a monopoly of good ideas, and where there are things that we can work on together, then my administration will certainly look to do that with anybody who thinks that we can work to the advantage of Wales."" Drakeford says Covid response kept Wales Labour PM calls devolution summit after Labour Senedd win What's the secret behind Labour's success in Wales? First woman of colour elected to Welsh Parliament The Welsh government ruled in a minority from 2011 to 2016, striking deals with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru at various points to pass budgets. Neath member of the Senedd (MS) Mr Miles said there were ""precedents where we have successfully been able to negotiate budget agreements, legislative arrangements on a case-by-case basis with other parties"". ""I think the mathematics of this Senedd, the response that the people of Wales have given, allows for that range of possibilities,"" he told the Sunday Supplement programme on BBC Radio Wales. In the last Welsh government Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams served as education minister. Jane Dodds, the Welsh Lib Dem leader elected as their only MS this time, has ruled out joining the Welsh government. She told the Dewi Llwyd ar Bore Sul programme on BBC Radio Cymru: ""I'm not expecting [an invite to join the government] and I don't want it to tell you the truth."" ""I don't have the experience of being in the Senedd. Kirsty had 15 or 16 years in the Senedd before she had a chance to be in the cabinet."" Mark Drakeford is in no rush. Having led Labour to a record-equalling tally of seats, he is not under pressure within the party. But tough times lie ahead. The pandemic is not over. The outlook is uncertain. In those circumstances, haggling over votes, lurching from deal to deal, is not an appealing prospect. That's why Mr Drakeford is sounding conciliatory. He wants stability in the Senedd and, if there is not to be a formal coalition, he must co-operate with opponents. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies saw the party's seats increase from 11 to 16 - the Tories' best-ever result, although far short of the numbers needed to govern. Mr Davies said: ""We've got the best result we've ever had in the assembly, nearly 50% more members returning, a new generation of Conservatives, the first lady coming to the assembly from an ethnic minority as well."" He told BBC Radio Wales he would like the next term's presiding officer (PO) - who chairs meetings and is a figurehead for the Welsh Parliament - to be from his party. ""I think it is important to reflect on the success of the Conservatives in this election, and give consideration to maybe a Conservative PO or DPO (deputy presiding officer),"" he said. ""I do think that from a consensual point of view, I think a progressive move would be to offer that consideration around a Conservative appointment."" Plaid Cymru came third at the election. Although its overall seat tally rose by two, it lost its prized constituency seat of the Rhondda in the south Wales valleys. The party's leader Adam Price told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement it was a ""disappointing result"" for Plaid Cymru electorally and a ""bitter blow"" in the Rhondda. But he said there were ""many positives"". He said Plaid Cymru had ""opened up the space for the Labour Party, and Mark Drakeford himself, probably, to take up a much more radical line on the constitution"". ""This is an election which actually has strengthened belief in Welsh self-government and in Welsh democracy,"" he added. Last night Prime Minister Boris Johnsoninvited the first ministers of Scotland and Wales to a summiton how ""Team UK"" can recover from the pandemic and face other ""shared challenges"". Welsh Labour Housing minister Julie James said she welcomed the invitation to a meeting if it was ""real"". She told the BBC's Politics Wales programme: ""We've been calling for many many years for a proper constitutional summit, where we talk properly about the role of devolution across the UK.""

"The rocket, which carried a Chinese space station section into orbit, was launched on 29 April The remains of a Chinese rocket that was hurtling back towards Earth have crashed into the Indian Ocean, the country's space agency says. The bulk of the rocket was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere, but state media reported that debris landed just west of the Maldives on Sunday. There have been days of speculation over where the rocket might land, and US officials and other experts warned its return risked potential casualties. But China insisted the risk was low. The Long March-5b vehicle re-entered the atmosphere at 10:24 Beijing time (02:24 GMT) on Sunday, state media reported, citing the Chinese Manned Space Engineering office. There were no reports of injuries or damage. It said debris from the 18-tonne rocket, one of the largest items in decades to have an undirected dive into the atmosphere, landed in the Indian Ocean at a point 72.47Â° East and 2.65Â° North. China launches first module of new space station Space debris removal demonstration launches US Space Command, meanwhile, simply said the rocket had ""re-entered over the Arabian Peninsula"". It did not confirm the landing point reported by Chinese media, saying instead that it was ""unknown if the debris [had] impacted land or water"". The monitoring service Space-Track, which uses US military data, said the rocket was recorded above Saudi Arabia before it fell into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. The uncontrolled return of the rocket led to pointed criticism from the US amid fears that it could land in an inhabited area. US and European websites tracked its return, and there was much speculation on social media about where the debris might land. ""Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth,"" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. ""It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris."" Space experts, however, predicted that the chances of anyone being hit were very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean and huge areas of land are uninhabited. The main segment from the Long March-5b vehicle was used to launch the first module of China's new space station last month. Originally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km (99 miles by 233 miles) above the Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage soon began to lose height. Long March-5B rocket launched the Tianhe module on 29 April Various space debris modelling experts predicted that most of the vehicle would burn up during its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there was always the possibility that metals with high melting points and other resistant materials could survive to the Earth's surface. When a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast in West Africa. China has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object. Commentary in the country's media had described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as ""hype"" and predicted the debris would fall somewhere in international waters. In recent years, China has made no secret of its space ambitions. The country has poured billions of dollars into its space efforts, and in 2019 it became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the endeavours and state media has frequently cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"". The Tiangong space station could be up and running as early as next year - and there is also talk in Chinese media of missions to Mars and a potential shared lunar station with Russia.

FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion Speaking to BT Sport, managerSam Allardycewas also asked whether he'll stay in charge at West Brom and look to bring them straight back up. ""It's too early to talk about that,"" he said. ""For me, it's about getting over the disappointment and when the time is right I'll talk about what's going to happen next season. ""At this moment in time, it's not a question I'm prepared to answer."" West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Sam Allardyce talking to MOTD:""It has been looking difficult for a while and we haven't taken our chance to give ourselves a better opportunity of staying up. ""I think these players should be fighting to stay out of it. They have performed well enough but our capabilities of scoring have deserted us. ""It is a disappointing night but we have to take it on the chin. It is not as painful for me as it is for the club or players. It is painful, I wanted it for the club and players more than me, but it hasn't happened. Everyone has to accept it and recover quickly."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Sport about importance of bouncing back:""The best way to do it is with the right attitude. ""The three goals were very different but really good individual and collective actions."" On Emile Smith Rowe scoring his first Premier League goal:""He is developing the right way but his first Premier League goal. His level is to do that and score 15 goals. He is making the right steps."" On Arsenal and the future:""We have done so many right steps, some you can see and some you can't. The foundations are there."" On feeling after Europa League exit:""I do take it, it is still there, still hurting. You can probably see in my body language it is still there. There were very small margins. I still feel very responsible."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion Manager Sam Allardyce speaking to BT Sport:""We took the game to Arsenal, because we had to, and we had opportunities to take the lead but failed to find the right ball or produce the right finish. ""Then in five minutes of sloppiness, Arsenal showed the quality of finishing we couldn't find. In the second half, instead of going under, we came out fighting. ""We had to wait for an absolutely brilliant goal by Matheus Pereira yet we had much better opportunities than that one. We had chances to convert and didn't do it, and that's probably been the most disappointing thing over the last 14-15 games - it was so near yet so far. ""Then right at the end we saw the difference in quality between the two sides with the free-kick which put them 3-1 up. ""I thought that was a bit flattering for them on the basis of the whole 90 minutes but it's something we've been suffering from for a while. While performances were good and I couldn't ask for too much more from the players tonight, it wasn't quite good enough.""  FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BT Sport:""We needed that win. It has been a while since we won at home. We scored three fantastic goals and we had some great spells in the game. When we conceded the goal we did look nervy. ""We knew the necessity to win the game. They scored out of nothing and then throw everything at you, they know the situation they are in and we struggled to play that kind of game. ""We scored three fantastic goals but we missed some big chances too. ""Europe is a completely different game, different context. There were things we could have done much better.

""I'm not saying we would have avoided relegation but we should have been closer, we should have taken it down to the last three games, based on how we performed. The creating of chances has been there but the converting has not. ""We had [enough] time to pull it round,"" Allardyce added. ""Our real problem was not beating the bottom-six sides when we came up against them. That would have given us a better chance of survival.

FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe, speaking to BT Sport:""We started a bit slow, our heads have been down for a couple of days. It was important for us to bounce back.

How much do you enjoy playing with Saka?""So much, I was saying to him before that he had to assist me, I've assisted him a few times this season. It was good to get the goal together. ""We are all going to fight for each other until the end."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Mikel Arteta really needed that, and Arsenal needed those flashes of brilliance with those goals.

"In the pandemic, hundreds of Chinese migrants who lost their jobs moved to a remote city on the Navajo Nation Indian reservation in New Mexico, to do what they thought was legal agricultural work. Instead, they and the local Native community found themselves pitted against one another in a bizarre cautionary tale about the boom in cannabis production in the US, and the impact on Asian migrant labourers. When Xia (not her real name) first heard about the job as a ""flower cutter"", she pictured roses. Details were scant, but a roommate told her it was 10 days' work for $200 a day, room and board included. Unemployed in the pandemic and unable to send money back to her adult children in southern China, Xia had been living at one of the crowded boarding houses common in the large Asian immigrant enclave of LA's San Gabriel Valley. The job sounded like a fine temporary solution. In early October, Xia and five other women made the 11-hour drive to the outskirts of Farmington, a small city nestled in the stunning but sparsely-populated high desert of northern New Mexico. When they arrived, their new boss checked them into a bright pink, roadside motel called the Travel Inn. The Travel Inn motel In a series of rooms on the first floor, Xia and her co-workers sat in chairs around heaps of plant material that were delivered by rental van in the night, trimming the ""flowers"" off the top. These were definitely not roses - the fan-leafed plants reminded Xia of Ã icÇo, or silvery wormwood, which the Chinese burn to ward off mosquitoes. The piles smelled so strongly that the odour hung around the motel like a cloud. But for the moment, Xia was content. A convivial middle-aged mother of two, she had worked many jobs since arriving in the US in 2015 - home carer, nanny, masseuse. This was a lot less lonely. ""I was happy. I could talk to other people at work,"" she recalls in Mandarin. ""I much prefer cutting flowers."" Just three days into their work, there was a knock at the door. Xia assumed it was someone calling them to dinner, until she saw men in uniforms with badges. Initially, it was impossible to communicate, until an officer who spoke Mandarin arrived. He asked the workers if they knew what kind of ""flowers"" they were cutting. One by one, they shook their heads. ""I wasn't afraid. I thought, 'I didn't commit any crime,'"" recalls Xia. ""When they put the handcuffs on me, I realised it's serious."" As a police convoy drove the workers to jail, someone attempted a joke: ""Hey, we are almost 60 years old, and it's our first time being handcuffed and riding a police car!"" With no translators to help communicate with law enforcement or her court-appointed lawyer, Xia says that for days she did little more than sit on her bunk and cry. She assumed the worst: that whatever she'd done would land her in prison doing hard labour, and she would never make it back home. ""I thought, 'My life is over,'"" she says. ""I thought of my son, and that he wouldn't even know if I died in America."" Seventeen workers were arrested Meanwhile, her mugshot and those of her co-workers were all over the local news. They'd been charged with multiple felonies for trafficking, conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance: high-grade marijuana. What Xia did not know was that over the summer, about 30 minutes up the highway from the bright pink motel, a massive marijuana farming operation had sprung up in the tiny town of Shiprock on the Navajo Nation reservation. Hundreds of Asian migrant workers like herself had flocked there from all over the US to live and work on the farms, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic. It was part of a recent, surprising expansion of Chinese-American investment into the US cannabis industry. Investors sought to recoup losses from shuttered restaurants, spas and tourism businesses by ploughing millions into cannabis - all despite the fact that marijuana remains a social taboo in the Chinese immigrant community. The mighty Shiprock or TsÃ© BitÊ¼aÊ¼Ã­, which means ""winged rock"" While hardly the only minority community interested in cannabis, in rural parts of the US, the Asian workforce stood out. This set the stage for a bitter fight with locals on the Navajo Nation, where unscrupulous entrepreneurs took advantage of the complex and confusing laws governing the industry, and set the farms on course for disaster. ""Everybody at one time was for the hemp because they lost their jobs in the pandemic,"" recalls one Navajo Nation resident. ""And then all of a sudden things changed... I think it turned everybody against one another."" The view from the top of Bea Redfeather's property on the Navajo Nation is breathtaking and severe. To the southwest is the cathedral-like TsÃ© BitÊ¼aÊ¼Ã­, or Shiprock pinnacle, a giant rock which rises nearly 1,580ft (480m) from the desert floor. Redfeather, a petite, 59-year-old tax accountant and silversmith, has lived here almost 30 years. ""This was peaceful,"" she says, looking out over the horizon. ""Calming."" Bea Redfeather looks into the distance at the top of a hill near her home in Shiprock, New Mexico All that changed in early June, when Redfeather saw an enormous lorry jostling down the narrow frontage road that separates her property from her neighbour's. A group of men got out and started unloading equipment into the empty field. It astonished Redfeather that on a reservation where new development is tightly controlled by tribal bureaucracy, a large-scale farming operation was going up across the street without her even hearing about it. The Navajo Nation was also struggling with a severe coronavirus outbreak, one of the worst in the country, and movement on and off the reservation was supposed to be tightly controlled. She decided to record what was going on on her phone. ""They're like, 'What are you doing here?'"" she recalls. ""These are non-Natives. So of course, I fired back saying, 'What are you doing here? You guys aren't allowed here.'"" Bea Redfeather Not long afterwards, Redfeather says that San Juan River Farm Board president Dineh Benally drove up, and came over to speak to her. She says he asked her how they could resolve the situation. ""I says, 'I'm going to stop you and what you're doing.' And you could see it in him. He was angry,"" she recalls. Benally, a former civil engineer for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the eldest son of a formidable tribal politician, was well known for his ambition to introduce the profitable cultivation of hemp and marijuana on the reservation. New Mexico legalised medical marijuana back in 2007, but state laws have no bearing in Indian country, which is governed by federal and tribal law. In 2017, Benally lobbied hard for a bill that would have legalised medical marijuana in the Navajo Nation. He called his efforts a ""crusade"" in memory of his late mother, who died of pancreatic cancer. Dineh Benally, the former San Juan Tribal Farm Board president, poses with cannabis plants ""Her last four months of her life she suffered,"" he told the tribal council, according to theNavajo Times,external. ""She didn't have the medication to have a better part of life."" The bill, however, was withdrawn before it ever came to a vote. Benally saw another way into the industry after the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills made it legal to grow industrial hemp. Like marijuana, hemp comes from the cannabis plant, but it contains almost no THC, the psychoactive compound that causes a user high. However, before hemp can be farmed, the state must first create a system to regulate production, including a way of testing THC concentration. Benally tried to convince the Navajo Nation leadership to do this so that the tribe could begin generating much-needed income from textiles and CBD oil products. But the council never showed much interest. The same year the medical marijuana bill stalled, Benally ran unopposed for the San Juan Farm Board, an entity with limited powers over farming permits on the reservation. This new position, Benally apparently believed, gave him the authority to approve his own hemp ""pilot project"". Through his lawyer, Benally declined to be interviewed for this story or to provide a statement: however, he has previously strongly denied any breach of the law. An aerial shot of the cannabis farms last summer in Shiprock, New Mexico ""The Navajo - we have the land and the water. We need an entity to help us hit the ground running,"" he told a reporter in 2019, boasting that he already had 100 acres of hemp growing on his property. Around this time, a friend of Benally's introduced him to Irving Lin. An irrepressible 70-year-old who immigrated decades ago from Taiwan, Lin made his fortune in California real estate but has no interest in an idle retirement. His enthusiasm for Chinese investment in marijuana is tempered only by his wife, whom he says will not allow him to profit directly from the sale of marijuana. Instead, he runs informational seminars in Los Angeles - mostly for Asian American business people drawn to marijuana cultivation as a way to bolster their flagging business portfolios. Irving Lin ran socially-distanced seminars during the pandemic ""This is very good for our Chinese people to go into,"" he says. ""I think cannabis sooner or later will be one of the Chinese major businesses."" Lin remembers Benally explaining that the Navajo Nation was a sovereign country, and that he could ""control their decision"". Lin began acting as matchmaker between his seminar participants and Navajo landowners who were interested in subleasing to the Chinese. This eventually amounted to millions of dollars in investment. These newly-minted farmers started going to their networks of family and friends to find labour. ""Suddenly so many people go there. Every day people are looking for a house, looking for land in a very short period. In six months, we had 1,000 people go there."" Irving Lin went so far as to personally drive workers from Los Angeles to Shiprock, for a fee Bea Redfeather was seeing the results at her doorstep. Twenty-five ""hoophouses"", inexpensive greenhouses made of steel frames with heavy-duty plastic covering, appeared seemingly overnight next door. Some farms that had previously grown traditional Navajo corn varieties now had hundreds of hoophouses, lined up in neat rows that stretched to the horizon. Dozens of hoop houses were built overnight last summer in Shiprock ""Corn is a sacred plant,"" Redfeather toldSearchlight New Mexico,external, the first media outlet to do an in-depth investigation into the farms. ""You can't eat hemp and marijuana."" Redfeather became obsessed with documenting the growth of the hemp farms in Shiprock on her Facebook Live. Her videos show heavy machinery grading the fields, trailer homes arriving on the back of trucks, and septic tanks being dug into the ground - the kind of major redevelopment that would normally take years to get approved. Before long, the air all around Shiprock hung with the smell of marijuana. At a cannabis farm near Bea Redfeather's property, workers unload tools from a truck The Navajo Nation police had been watching Benally, too. They suspected the ""hemp"" that he had been growing on his own land was actually marijuana. But according to Navajo Nation Police Chief Phillip Francisco, to shut him down, they had to prove that his crop's THC levels were higher than 0.3%. With no drug lab of their own, Navajo police sent samples to an outside agency. While the Navajo police waited, the pandemic hit. ""After Covid started, we started seeing a lot of these farms spring up fast,"" says Francisco, who had only 180 patrol officers trying to enforce health mandates over a 27,000sq-m (70,000 sq-km) reservation. ""I think that's what he took advantage of."" The situation was yet another example of just how complex law enforcement in Indian Country can be. Benally's interpretation of tribal hemp laws got his farms started. Meanwhile, because so many of the workers showing up in Shiprock were non-Native, the tribal police had no authority to charge them with anything. Similarly, the San Juan County Sheriff and the Farmington Police Department had no jurisdictional power on the reservation or over Native workers. The next step would be to involve federal authorities like the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the FBI - but they have limited staffing and can be notoriously slow to respond. The farms continued to grow throughout the summer, until there were 36 hemp operations in total. ""I've never seen anything like that in my 22-year career,"" says Chief Francisco. ""Never would we have worried about this magnitude of an operation, right under our noses."" When Navajo police responded to complaints, the workers told them they had permission from the landowners to farm there - it turned out that 33 Navajo farmers had signed agreements to sublease their land to people like Benally, and Chinese investors. Like the migrant workers, many Navajo were suffering income losses during the pandemic, and these non-Native investors were paying cash. The farmers provided official-looking ""provisional cannabis cultivation"" licences, issued by Benally's farm board. ""We said yes to hemp when [we thought it was] legal,"" one landowner told the BBC before hanging up. For Redfeather, the final straw came one morning when a worker from the nearby hemp farm gestured threateningly with what looked like an AK-47 at her mother, who was sitting on their porch drinking coffee. ""I was angry. Really, really angry,"" she says. For protection, she bought a rifle of her own. Using her new-found social media capital, Redfeather began organising protests against the hemp farms. They called themselves KÃ©yah - or land - Protectors. In the first protest, roughly 100 Shiprock residents shut down a road through town carrying signs that said things like, ""We Don't Need Chinese to Farm"" and ""Hemp is Not the Navajo Way"". A young boy on a microphone shouted, ""No Asian invasion!"" ""This is in no way a racial issue,"" one resident told theNavajo Times,external, which broke many of the earliest stories about the unfolding disaster. ""They use all our resources within the community starting with the land, water and peopleâ¦ That's not right."" The protests led to tense confrontations between anti-hemp Navajo residents and the Navajo farm owners who had sublet their land for hemp. ""You're a traitor!"" protesters yelled at a farm owner across the gate in one particularly heated demonstration. Shiprock residents protesting against cannabis farms In another video, Redfeather comes face-to-face with a tall, barrel-chested young man in a tactical vest and a skull face mask pulled over his nose and mouth. ""Isn't your dad a medicine man?"" Redfeather shouts at him as he blocks her path on to the farm. The young man - 25-year-old Brandon Billie - didn't particularly mind these confrontations. As Dineh Benally's head of security, Billie liked the excitement of chasing thieves and vandals off the farms. More importantly, it was steady work at a time when jobs were scarce. Brandon Billie worked as a security guard protecting Dineh Benally's cannabis farms ""He hired anybody who was willing to work,"" Billie says. ""The income was low and all that. But it was something. It was a job."" As threats to the workers became more frequent, Billie moved into a mobile home alongside the Asian workers. He communicated with them using translation apps and says they hosted cookouts together. The Chinese made spicy noodles and roasted a whole pig's head for the Navajo workers. The Navajos cooked fry bread, mutton stew and blue corn mush in return. Billie started to dream about one day visiting his new friends' hometowns in China. ""I called them my brothers and sisters,"" he says. But the job was causing problems at home. Although his father initially supported his son's work in hemp, that position became untenable as public opinion turned against the farms. When Billie told his family that he had too much riding on the farms to quit, his father cut off communication. Brandon Billie On the frigid morning of 9 November, Billie had just made a cup of coffee and was about to go back inside his trailer when he heard a loud thud. He turned to see police vehicles crashing over a small dirt hill towards the camp. He says officers jumped out with AR-15s pointed at him, handcuffed him and put him into the back of a state trooper's vehicle. The Navajo Nation Police serves an injunction at a Chinese cannabis farm in Shiprock The same dramatic scene was playing out on farms all over Shiprock. After weeks of planning, a massive task force had finally mobilised, including dozens of officers from Navajo, state and local police, as well as agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency. Over the course of three days, ""Operation Navajo Gold"" tore through the farms and seized crops. They quickly proved what everyone already knew: the farms were full of marijuana, not hemp. Agents recovered 60,000lb (27,215kg) of it on 21 farms and in two private homes. In one greenhouse, they found 1,000lb (450kg) of fully-processed marijuana already placed in baggies for individual sale. After the police raids many workers left overnight, leaving scenes of chaos in their trailer homes Billie and dozens of farm workers were transported to the gymnasium of Shiprock High School. In the same room where the principal had handed him his high school diploma, Billie was grilled by an FBI agent about what he knew about Benally's operation. Unlike the workers from the Travel Inn, no-one was arrested. The labourers were met by several Mandarin translators from the FBI, and Lynn Sanchez, from the New Mexico Human Trafficking Task Force. It was her job to provide services to the workers now that their homes and job sites had become an active crime scene. ""They looked very scared,"" says Sanchez. ""I just remember looking at this older man, he had to be about 65 or older than that. He had tears in his eyes that just wouldn't fall."" The task force and another organisation called Life Link were able to provide funds for travel and compensation for lost wages to a few dozen workers. Others simply disappeared. Chief Francisco says in the first days after the raid, he heard reports of Asian workers trying to hitchhike and sleeping rough. Phillip Francisco, Navajo Nation Chief of Police Sanchez says that the conditions she saw on the farms, with some sleeping outdoors or on wooden pallets, without access to proper sanitation or medical care, were clear signs of labour trafficking. However, applying the ""trafficking"" label is complicated, both in a legal sense and for the workers themselves, no matter how squalid the conditions. ""In the informal economy, it might be completely exploitative and it doesn't mean that person is not choosing to do this,"" says Erin Albright, founder of New Frameworks, an anti-trafficking organisation. ""There are no other options for them."" Booming cannabis plants at a farm in Shiprock last summer Sanchez found that some of the workers did not accept that they were ""victims"" and declined her assistance. ""It was by mutual consent,"" one 36-year-old worker toldInitium Media,external, a Hong Kong digital magazine that interviewed many of the Chinese workers in Shiprock. ""No-one forced me to do anything."" Sanchez and her organisation were also told by a public defender that the 17 workers from the Travel Inn motel were still somewhere in Farmington. They found Xia and her five friends sharing another cheap motel room. After their release from jail, a judge told the flower cutters not to leave New Mexico. They'd been holed up in the room for 10 days, unsure of what to do next, living on nothing but plain rice porridge. By that point, however, the county prosecutor had been convinced that the women had not knowingly been part of a drug cartel. He dropped the charges. Using funds from Sanchez's trafficking task force, Xia and her friends drove back over the mountains to California. When her children in China asked why they hadn't heard from her in so long, Xia lied. ""I told them my mobile phone was broken. If they know the truth, they'd be worried,"" she says. ""Thinking back,"" she adds, ""it's like a nightmare."" Back in the boarding house, Xia was able to rest for a few weeks. But there was still no work and coronavirus case numbers began to surge once again in Los Angeles. She heard from her friends that some workers had gone directly from the Shiprock farms to ones in Oklahoma - the latest frontier in the marijuana gold rush. A friend told Xia she could get a job with her in a massage parlour, and after that, maybe they could go back to farm work. ""All jobs are tough,"" she remembers thinking. ""I still need to endure, to make a living and to support my family."" So once, again, Xia packed her things and drove off towards the unknown. Oklahoma City's Asia District is a roughly 10-block stretch of Chinese grocery stores, bubble tea shops and restaurants, dotted on either side of a busy four-lane thoroughfare. Near its centre is the Fujianese Association of Oklahoma, which opened its doors in late 2020. In a room decorated with Chinese and American flags, men play mahjong at two tables as others stand around watching. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, the sound of clinking mahjong tiles, and occasional bursts of laughter and cursing. A Chinese and American flag on the wall of the Fujianese association Dressed in T-shirts, jeans and sneakers, the men range in age from their 30s to 60s. One of them says they are mostly restaurant entrepreneurs who'd moved to Oklahoma to take part in the booming marijuana industry. According to Irving Lin, at least a dozen Chinese investors he knows took their workforce and what little they could salvage from the New Mexico farms straight to Oklahoma. ""You stopped me in New Mexico. I immediately go to Oklahoma,"" Lin says. ""So what? Next!"" Others were not so lucky. One California investor told the BBC that she'd lost all her savings and the home she put up as collateral. Some of the luckier investors were at the Fujianese Association, but none would speak about their experiences in New Mexico. Asked directly by the BBC, a few only smile politely and shake their heads. ""What is cannabis?"" one player asks with a cheeky smile. ""None of us knows anything about it!"" Eventually, a sophisticated-looking man in a long wool coat - a single AirPod hanging from one ear - arrives at the club. He says his name is Michael, and though he wasn't involved in the Shiprock venture, he is well aware of the debacle. He points out three men puffing cigarettes at one of the tables, and says he knows they lost their investment there. The Asia District in Oklahoma City ""You can try,"" he says softly in Mandarin, ""but I don't think they'd talk to you about New Mexico."" Later, in a conversation over the phone, Michael explains that the investors involved in Shiprock are embarrassed for having unknowingly broken the laws and suffered financial losses. Besides, many in the Chinese community still consider marijuana a dangerous narcotic drug, and the men are not eager to discuss it with reporters. At the beginning of the pandemic, Michael, who's in his 50s, saw the economic fallout coming and sold his three acupuncture businesses on the east coast. He came to Oklahoma in June, after convincing a few Fujianese friends to pool their money. He says they now own several legal cannabis-related businesses, including a farm and an agricultural equipment store, even though he says he's never even smoked marijuana. Michael says most of his workers are Fujianese restaurant workers who came from all over the country, landing them - improbably - at the buckle of the Bible Belt, in a state better known for its cowboy history and staunchly Republican politics. ""If it weren't for the pandemic,"" says Michael, ""I'd have never come here."" Since legalising medical marijuana in 2018, this socially conservative state has rapidly become the country's hottest weed market due to its hands-off regulatory approach. The cost of obtaining a cannabis licence in Oklahoma is just $2,500, compared with tens of thousands of dollars in other states. The state also has no cap on how many licences can be issued. As a result, it's in the midst of a ""green gold rush"", says Matt Stacy, an Oklahoma City attorney who helps clients secure cultivation licences. He estimates he has about 300 Chinese clients. ""I didn't expect it,"" he says. ""It grew quickly."" 9 May 2021 Though the cost of entry is low in Oklahoma, the cannabis business is by nature extremely capital and labour intensive. The Chinese immigrant community in the US has both resources, on a large scale. Recruitment is often done through word of mouth, cannabis groups on Chinese messaging app WeChat or sometimes through hometown associations like the Fujianese social club. There are also employment agencies in Chinatowns across the US, matching Chinese-run businesses with low-wage immigrant workers. In a state where the Asian population is about 2%, the newcomers haven't gone unnoticed. Jayne and Vic Grissom obtained one of Oklahoma's first cultivation licences in 2018 and run a small, sleek dispensary outside Oklahoma City. Last August, when a group of Chinese men purchased an 80-acre plot and built a huge farming compound across the street from their home, the couple was surprised. ""Oklahoma is not a very diverse state,"" Jayne explains. ""To have that many Chinese coming in, especially where we are, which is really rural, I just found it really bizarre."" The couple - who grow three shipping containers of ""craft cannabis"" with names like 66 Cookies, OK Boomer, Spicy Berry - are concerned that these new, large-scale growers will flood the market with product or begin shipping it illegally across state lines to sell. It is only legal to grow marijuana for consumption in Oklahoma. Jayne and Vic Grissom in their marijuana plant display room ""It's the wild, wild west here,"" says Vic. ""It's a gold rush, or a curse for Oklahoma, I don't know which one."" Chinese American cannabis farm owner ""Aaron"" does not want his real name used, but happily opens his gates to visitors. In his flip-flops and sweatpants, a cigarette always balanced on his lips or between his fingers, Aaron proudly shows off his weed empire. For a man who just months earlier had zero experience growing marijuana, the fledgling operation is astonishing in its scale. The farm contains several warehouse-like buildings filled with countless cannabis plants. It's like a botanical garden, but with the ambience of an assembly line. About a dozen Chinese workers sit on small benches among the bushes, carefully pruning the adolescent plants. Aaron's marijuana farm in Oklahoma Aaron's employees stay in a house just down the road, a couple of rambunctious puppies in the yard. That afternoon they were preparing to make a massive batch of fishball soup from fish they caught in a pond behind the property. Aaron, too, hails from Fujian. He was smuggled into the US on a ship as a teenager decades ago, when illegal immigration from Fujian was rampant. Life was tough in the first years. Aaron endured back-breaking work and harsh living conditions when working in restaurants across the country, in places like Maine and Ohio. He still vividly remembers the despair he felt, when he arrived at strange new cities with all his belongings in a backpack and no clue where he was. ""My only option was to bear hardship and not to complain,"" Aaron says in Mandarin. ""If I had lost my job, I wouldn't know where I could go."" He learned English on the street, eventually obtained a green card, and went on to make his first pot of gold in the restaurant industry in Florida. He claims he once owned more than 30 restaurants there. A Chinese worker trims a marijuana plant at Aaron's cannabis farm in Oklahoma Aaron now employs workers with similar backgrounds to Xia's, who are relatively new to America and willing to take labour-intensive jobs to survive. But Aaron thinks things are much better than when he first arrived in the US, with mobile phones to keep in touch with family back home, a more established Asian immigrant network in the US and hence, greater leverage with the employers. ""I treat them as my grandpas and grandmas,"" he says with a big smile on his face. ""The Chinese people are very adaptable. We find ways to survive in all sorts of situations."" That does not mean that life in Oklahoma for the recent transplants has been easy. ""When the police see Asian faces in an out-of-state car, they will order you to pull over,"" says Michael, claiming he has been pulled over three times in Oklahoma by police officers. ""They inspected every little corner in my car."" Under federal and state laws, law enforcement officers can seize cash based only on the suspicion it was earned from or used to commit a crime. Michael says this is a big problem for an immigrant community accustomed to doing everything in cash - for example, he says he has never owned a credit or debit card in his 30 years living in America. Matt Stacy, the cannabis lawyer, takes on several cases involving forfeited cash every week, in some instances, for tens of thousands of dollars. ""We have to prove over and over that the money that someone was lawfully carrying with them is actually their money."" He believes the practice has a disproportionate impact on his Asian immigrant clients, many of whom don't speak English well. ""The fact is, this is an unbanked industry,"" Stacy says - as marijuana is not yet decriminalised federally, bank options are limited for cannabis entrepreneurs. After the debacle in New Mexico, the Oklahoman farmers are even more concerned about the presumption by locals and law enforcement that their operations are not above board. And there are already signs of trouble. In late April, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics raided a cannabis farm, which has a legal medical marijuana licence but allegedly sold large quantities of its product on the black market. Eleven people were taken into custody, who, the police say, are potential owners and workers from Taiwan and China, and do not speak English. A bill that requires licence holders to disclose any ""foreign financial interest"" in marijuana businesses is moving through the state legislature. Cannabis magazines are on display in the office of Matt Stacy Nevertheless, Irving Lin insists the majority of Asian farmers are complying with Oklahoma law. ""They are good people,"" Lin says. ""They are doing nothing wrong. They need to take care of the family."" While Lin still sees a bright future in cannabis in Oklahoma, back in Shiprock the community is in disarray. The farms now lie empty. Inside abandoned mobile homes and barely insulated plywood shacks, the contents of every cupboard, drawer and closet are strewn across the floors, likely the work of law enforcement searching for evidence. The air smells of sewage and rotting food. Clothes still hang in the closets. Toothbrushes sit beside sinks. Outside, empty bottles and Chinese cigarette packets tumble across the fallow fields. ""All we see is plastic. We see trash. We see dead marijuana plants,"" says Bea Redfeather. ""That's what they left us with."" Abandoned hoophouses in Shiprock In the November 2020 election, Redfeather ran for San Juan Farm Board president and won, unseating Benally. She is sticking by her campaign promise to strip the 33 Navajo landowners of their farming permits, and trying to figure out how to start the huge cleanup. The Navajo Nation attorney general's office has also sued the landowners. Seventeen of those farmers have banded together to form a new, pro-hemp farmers' association, claiming they ""were unaware of hemp operator principal Dineh Benally's intentions to grow illegal crops"". A lawyer representing the group says they may even sue for what they say was an overzealous law enforcement response that included pointing guns at elderly Navajo landowners. Chinese cigarette boxes now litter the landscape Benally has left Shiprock, where he is facing charges of conspiracy, aggravated assault and interfering with judicial proceedings. Because a federal investigation by the DEA and FBI is still open, it's not clear how many migrant workers were in Shiprock, or whether charges for any of the farmers or investors are being considered. According to Sanchez, momentum is building behind a labour trafficking inquiry, thanks to cooperation from the Travel Inn workers. Brandon Billie also no longer feels welcome in the Navajo Nation. Today, he works in health care in a nearby town, pulling long, late-night shifts. During the day, he sleeps in the back of his battered SUV in the parking lot. He has an apartment near Shiprock but stays away for his and his family's protection. Brandon Billie rarely goes home to see his parents any more for fear of retribution from his community ""Shiprock has changed so much,"" he says. ""I just don't feel welcome no more."" Gone, too, are the dreams of travelling to China. He says he tried to stay in touch with his favourite workers, but one by one they stopped responding. Xia's experience in Oklahoma was short and disappointing, as well. The flower trimming work never materialised, and she wound up working as a masseuse again. The friends who did make it on to the farms told her to stay away. ""The snow is very heavy and thick,"" they warned. She decided to cut her losses and go back to LA. In March, a gunman on a shooting spree in Atlanta, Georgia, killed eight people - six of them Asian women. The murderer targeted massage businesses similar to the ones Xia has worked in for years, and the victims included Korean and Chinese immigrants who, like her, travelled all over the country searching for work. The killings came after weeks of reported increases in hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans, particularly women, across the US. As a result, Xia no longer wants to work in spas, further narrowing her already scant job prospects. Even though she hasn't made the amount of money she was hoping to send home to her family, she's not sure how much longer she will stay in the US. ""I often hear about Chinese people getting beaten up. We remind each other to be careful,"" she says. ""It's so scary. It's like living in terror."" After everything she'd been through, Xia says she's still happiest among the fan-leafed plants of the cannabis farms. A few months after her return to California, she finds work at an outdoor grow where the hours are long and the sun beats down on her back. The job is seasonal and sporadic, but anytime she can, Xia says she will be back on the farm. ""If you don't mind the hardship and tiredness,"" she says, ""a day at the farm passes quickly.""

"UK minister Michael Gove tells the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Westminster government would not go to court to stop a second Scottish independence referendum Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP's ""historic"" Scottish election win means there is a mandate to hold another vote But she does not believe that the timing of an indyref2 should, or would, be determined in the courts The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority The Scottish Conservatives secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2); and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Boris Johnson has invited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit The Scottish election turnout was 63.2% - the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News There has been further reaction today following the SNP's emphatic victory in Thursday's Scottish Parliament election. Here are some of the key points:  That's all from the live page today. Thanks for joining us.  Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Holyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now. The class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP. It has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women. Among those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories. Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Polling expert Ailsa Henderson says the turnout figure was higher than three of the last six UK general elections in Scotland, though not the last three. At 63.4%, it was up 7.6 percentage points on 2016, meaning an extra 425,000 voted. Prof Henderson says the rise was good for democracy, for participation and engagement in politics. She says extending the right to vote and the ease of access helped with the high turnout. The picture across Scotland as the SNP win a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent It is perhaps understandable that there is lots of talk of
independence and referendums the morning after a Holyrood election, given the
SNP have won big once again. However, there is an argument to be made that the
constitution is not necessarily the most interesting storyline in the wake of
the polls. There is still a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, and
there is still an intense debate about mandates and process. But for all that,
neither side actually wants anything to happen immediately, while there is
still a pandemic to be dealing with. The arguments being exchanged this morning are really rather
familiar, and there is little incentive for anyone to change their tune
straight away â not until the facts on the ground change, such as with the passing
of a referendum bill at Holyrood. And there are some really pressing issues for the SNP in the
coming days and weeks as it forms a new administration. To start with â who will take up key Cabinet posts left
vacant by retiring MSPs? These include the health secretary, during a pandemic; the constitution secretary, as Brexit unfolds; and the environment secretary, in the
year of COP26. And then there are the other big ideas in the SNP manifesto
â things like a National Care Service, a minimum income guarantee, publicly-owned rail services. The constitution was clearly a big issue in the campaign and
thus it is no surprise that it is the focus of intense discussion today. But
there is a lot more to Scottish politics than just the question of
independence. Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh, told the Sunday Show the parties are roughly where they were after the 2016 election. That might lead people to believe it was a boring election, she says, but there is a lot of churn occurring below the surface. Prof Henderson says there are three distinct patterns of voting behaviour on display, what she calls ""a three-Scotland model"". One is areas with strong Yes support at the referendum in 2014. Here the SNP support has held up well and there is relatively little movement among the other parties. In areas with strong No support you see bigger swings among the pro-union parties, she says. The direction of these swings, sometimes in excess of 10 percentage points, depends on how those areas voted in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In stronger Remain areas, pro-union voters have shifted to Labour or sometimes the Lib Dems. In stronger Leave areas (perhaps above 40% in favour of Brexit) you see pro-union voters shifting to the Conservatives. So seven years after Indyref and five years after the Brexit referendum we see that both are still influencing voting in Scottish elections, Prof Henderson says. Lynsey BewsBBC Scotland political correspondent Nicola Sturgeon has been on TV this morning stressing that the ability to hold an independence referendum is a fundamental issue of democracy. She says she has been saying that for a long time. Remember the SNP said they already had a mandate for a second referendum after the 2016 election and they say this result adds to that. There has been debate over whether the UK government would mount a legal challenge should the SNP administration proceed with its own legislation for a referendum. Michael Gove didn't really want to be drawn on any of that this morning. He wanted to deflect and turn the talk on to pandemic recovery. We are really just seeing this continuation of the debate that already existed, slightly intensified by the election we had. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon joined some of the SNP's newly-elected MSPs for a photocall during a visit to Airdrie, North
Lanarkshire. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout. Some 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full 10 percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls. It is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. The rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees. And the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted. People might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown. Indeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Pam Gosal told the Sunday Show she was very proud to be the first Indian Sikh to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. Ms Gosal was elected as a Conservative MSP for the West of Scotland region. Along with Kaukab Stewart of the SNP, who was elected to represent the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. They were the first women of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament in its 22-year history. While Ms Stewart first stood for election in 1999, Ms Gosal says she has only been in politics for one-and-a-half years. She says the Scottish Conservatives supported her to be able to stand and get elected so quickly. Ms Gosal adds that she will be ""calling out"" any abuse from internet trolls and keyboard warriors as she goes about her business at Holyrood. Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater says she is delighted to have won the largest Green group ever at Holyrood. The party won eight seats, up two from 2016. Ms Slater says: ""I think it'll give us significantly more influence. Having the SNP as a minority government means that with every single piece of legislation they need to work with another party. ""Whenever they choose to work with us we can push them to be more progressive, to be fairer, to be greener, to be more environmentally concerned."" Ms Slater says her party's position is different to the SNP on many issues but the Greens were good at amending legislation to make it greener and fairer.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show the Scottish people voted in an election for the parliament to use the powers it has and another independence referendum is outside its remit. He says the people he spoke to were voting for recovery from the Covid pandemic. Mr Ross says he had to put blocking an independence referendum at the forefront of his campaign because the SNP had put holding the vote at the heart of its push. He says he has spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and he wants all the UK nations to work together to deliver the recovery from Covid.  Asked about voters who say Labour has left them, Anas Sarwar says
he doesnât think people should be considering the politics of 20 years ago. The country has changed because of the independence referendum, Brexit
and Covid, and Scottish Labour  can not revert back to the politics that won the General election in 1997, he says. ""It isnât going to work in 2021,"" Mr Sarwar tells the Sunday Show. ""Weâve got to confront the world as it
is and have vision about where we want to take the country. âI want us to unite our country. I want us to have a politics
of hope and empathy, but also transform what we are as a nation in terms of
being an outward looking nation, thatâs fighting poverty, thatâs getting its
NHS back on track and building the education system so it can be the best in
the world."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party has done well despite having fewer Holyrood seats. ""I think you need to remember where we were 10 weeks ago,"" he says, referring to the opinion polls before he became leader of the party. Scotland hasnât had a good opposition, he adds, but âLabour is back on
the pitchâ. He says he will push for Covid recovery first and work to unite the country. He promises to work with any other party willing to fulfil their election promises on the recovery. ""Yes we will have big disagreements,"" he says. ""But that will not stop me working with them."" Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all of its major reforms. If it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead. The Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes. It also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts SNP deputy leader Keith Brown says the first 100 days of the new government will be dedicated to making sure we get through Covid. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be back behind her desk at Bute House this afternoon to get on with that. Mr Brown says the SNP's massive victory gives them a mandate for a second independence referendum. And he adds that the referendum will happen when it is safe to hold one. Mr Brown says he is ""very confident"" an independence referendum will result in success for the Yes side. There is no question the pandemic has changed the financial fundamentals and an independent Scotland will have to deal with that, he says. There will be a detailed White Paper setting out the proposals before an independence campaign begins, he adds. Here's a reminder of some of the key points from the Scottish election results: Mr Gove is asked if he has concerns about his party's performance in Scotland after the SNP was returned to government for a fourth successive term. He says: ""Let's look at the facts, Nicola Sturgeon did not secure a majority. Good result but not a majority as Alex Salmond did in 2011. ""Secondly, the proportion of votes for pro-union parties in the constituencies was more than 50%. ""Third, we had, not just 31 MSPs being re-elected but also the biggest vote for the Scottish Conservatives in the history of Holyrood."" Mr Gove says it is the best result ever for the Scottish Conservatives. BBC Scotland's Sunday Show asks Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to clarify the indication he gave to the Andrew Marr show that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove says: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principle focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denies he is giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill. ""Nope, what we are concentrating on is recovery at the moment,"" he says. Mr Gove says he will not be drawn down the cul-de-sac of a constitutional rammy. ""My sense is people in Scotland don't want their politicians to be having abstract arguments about the Supreme Court, they want them to be relentlessly focused on making sure we have recovery first and foremost,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon is asked if there is any chance of a personal rapprochement between herself and former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond. Sturgeon replies: ""I donât think Alex Salmond and I are going to go back to the way things were but there is nothing about what has happened around Alex Salmond in the last few years that gives me any pleasure whatsoever, it is a source of quite deep sadness to me. ""That's personal obviously - the politics are separate."" Ms Sturgeon says she has the energy and appetite to take Scotland through Covid ""and then I hope to lead Scotland to independence"". ""But the future of Scotland, and I hope the independent future Scotland, is much bigger than any one individual politician,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

The victim was a 53-year-old Vietnamese woman who had underlying medical problems, including diabetes, state media reported. Infections have rocketed in the country of seven million since last month, when the worst surges also began in neighbouring Thailand and Cambodia. Laos has still identified only 1,302 infections since the pandemic began.  US President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July The US is ""turning the corner"" on the pandemic, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients has said. But he also stressed the importance of all Americans getting vaccinated. Speaking to CNN,external, Zients said 58% of adult Americans had received at least one dose, while more than 110 million had been fully vaccinated. Asked about the vaccination rate slowing down and how hesitant groups were being targeted, Zients said: ""We want everyone to get vaccinated and we have enough supply for all adults Americans to get vaccinated. We just want to make it easier and easier for people to get vaccinated. ""And for those who do have questions about efficacy or about safety, the three authorised vaccines are all very safe and very effective, so we want people to be able to turn to their trusted leader in their neighbourhood - their doctor, their faith leader - to get information about the vaccines, to build vaccine confidence so all Americans get vaccinated.""

In the Philippines, a second surge in Covid-19 cases is putting renewed pressure on the healthcare system.

The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech as reliable partners that deliver on their commitments. Read more here on why the EU is suing AstraZeneca. The UK has recorded another two Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There were also a further 1,770 cases reported on Sunday, according tothe government's dashboard,external. Vaccinations continued with 607,864 total jabs on Saturday - 169,027 were first doses while 438,837 were second doses. Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Chelsea and Man City will meet each other in the Champions League Final Scientists on the Independent Sage committee have called for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea to be moved to the UK from Turkey to reduce Covid risks. The final is due to take place in Istanbul on 29 May. But the UK government this week said fans of both clubsshould not travel to Turkeyfor the final after it was added to England's travel red list. In a statement the Independent Sage committee said: âWe wholeheartedly endorse negotiations between the FA and Uefa to relocate the Champions league final to the United Kingdom in order to give the most fans the best chance of attending in the safest possible environment."" Transport secretary Grant Shapps this week said the government was open to hosting the game in the UK. A third of adults in England have now had both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, NHS England says. Latest data shows that 14,871,208 people aged 18 and over have received their first and second dose of the jab, with more than two thirds of adults having already had their first jab. A total of 44,449,424 vaccines have been delivered. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: âReaching this milestone is no accident - it is down to months of hard work and everyone in the NHS who has played a role in this is helping to protect millions of people from serious illness and saving lives."" Cases are dropping slightly in the city but authorities do not want to squander progress Delhi has extended and tightened its lockdown, as cases slowly drop in the city. ""The positivity rate has gone down but still we can't afford leniency,"" Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said. The lockdown will now continue until 17 May, and additional restrictions will come into force - including the closure of the Metro and a ban on public marriage ceremonies. Mr Kejriwal also thanked the people of the city for helping bring down infections. ""Everyone adhered to the norms of the lockdown. We have not done this as a favour to anyone else, this is a matter of our own lives and health"" he said. Authorities imposed a lockdown on 20 April as cases soared in India.

But what about upcoming changes to rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? Remember, all rule changes are subject to approval by the devolved administrations - with decisions made this week. InScotland, up to four people from no more than two households can socialise indoors in a private home from 17 May. Up to six adults from three households can meet in an indoor public place (such as a bar), and up to eight adults from eight households can meet anywhere outdoors. InWales, pubs, restaurants, museums and cafes can reopen indoors from 17 May. Cinemas, theatres and museums can also reopen. People inNorthern Irelandhave to wait a little longer for the next set of restrictions to ease. From 24 May, indoor hospitality, including pubs and hotels, reopens. Indoor group exercise will also be allowed and some indoor household mixing in private residences. Read more about all the ruleshere. New Zealand health officials have cleared the way for quarantine-free flights to resume to Sydney after fears of a Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales eased. Flights were suspended on Thursday after two people in Sydney tested positive for the virus. It was the third disruption since the quarantine-free travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia opened on 18 April, almost 400 days after both closed their international borders due to the pandemic. The earlier stoppages to flights to and from Western Australia lasted only a few days and the current travel pause with New South Wales would end at midnight on Sunday. ""The current assessment from New Zealand public health officials is that the risk to New Zealand from New South Wales remains low,"" the health ministry said in a statement. The US has administered some 250 million doses of vaccines to its population, more than 75 doses per 100 people.It's one of the world's most successful vaccination programmes, with President Joe Biden aiming to vaccinate 70% of the country by 4 July. But demand for doses seems to be slowing, and the rate of vaccination is plummeting. According to the Associated Press,states across the US are asking for fewer and fewer jabs,externalfrom the federal government, causing a growing stockpile of vaccines. Doses are allocated by population size, and state governments can then request how many they want each week. Iowa has asked for 29% of its allocated doses; Connecticut 26%; South Carolina 21%; and Iowa and Wisconsin just 9% and 8%, respectively. Last week President Biden said his administration was working to win over ""doubters"" about the shots.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked About seven million Germans are fully vaccinated Both the EU and UK have seen heated debates on whether or not to let people who have had the jab do more than those who have not. From Sunday, everyone in Germany who has been fully vaccinated is now exempt from many restrictions across the country, according to new legislation there. There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses. But they'll still have to observe social distancing rules and wear a mask on public transport. The EU has already announced plans for a vaccine passport - known as a digital green certificate - which will cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered. Until that comes into force though, Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller has advised Germans to carry proof of vaccination - otherwise it will be ""damn difficult to check"" if they were exempt from rules or not, AFP news agency reported. South Africa has confirmed four cases of a new Covid variant that first appeared in India. All four were people who had a history of travel to India. They were found in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The health ministry said 11 cases of the UK variant B.1.1.7 have also been detected. South Africa is the hardest hit nation on the continent, recording more infections and deaths than any other country there.

A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams.

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling.

Scotland's first minister has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a second independence referendum is ""a matter of when - not if"". Nicola Sturgeon spoke directly with Mr Johnson for the first time since the SNP won an emphatic victory in Thursday's Holyrood election. Earlier, Ms Sturgeon said she did not expect the debate to end up in court. A senior UK government minister appeared to suggest it would not mount a legal challenge to her plans. During a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday afternoon, the first minister pledged to work with the UK government on steering the country through the Covid pandemic towards recovery. Scottish election 2021: Results in maps and charts How the newspapers reacted in Scotland The SNP said the leaders also agreed the importance of both governments working together ""closely and constructively"" to make the forthcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow a success. But a party spokeswoman added: ""The FM also re-iterated her intention to ensure that the people of Scotland can choose our own future when the crisis is over, and made clear that the question of a referendum is now a matter of when - not if."" Boris Johnson has invited Ms Sturgeon to a summit on a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic The UK Government said Mr Johnson spoke to the first minister to ""congratulate her on her party's success"" in the Scottish Parliament election. A spokesman said the prime minister emphasised ""the importance of focusing on Covid recovery at this time"". He added: ""They both agreed that their immediate focus should be on working together to build back from the pandemic. ""The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation for the first minister to join a summit meeting to discuss our shared challenges on Covid recovery and how we can overcome them."" Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned whether she would introduce a referendum bill as early as next spring based on predictions that the UK will have recovered in terms of coronavirus circulation and GDP. She said: ""That would certainly work for that timescale of within the first half of the parliamentary term. ""I desperately hope those predictions are correct but we have to judge that as we go through this year. We've still got significant challenges ahead. I wouldn't rule that out but I'm not sitting here saying that is the timescale."" Mr Johnson earlier invited Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford to a summit to discuss a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic. He has said it would be ""reckless and irresponsible"" to have a referendum right now, and the UK government is not currently expected to grant formal consent for a vote to be held - as it did ahead of the 2014 referendum. Ms Sturgeon congratulated five of the SNP's new MSPs on Sunday morning There has been speculation that the row could end up with the courts being asked to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a referendum without the UK government's agreement. But Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe either side wanted a legal battle over the issue. She said: ""The UK government knows that if we ever get into a situation where this is being determined in the courts then actually what the UK government is arguing is that there is no democratic route for Scotland to have independence. ""The implications of that would be very grave indeed. If the argument of the unionist side is that Scotland is trapped it strikes me that that is one of the strongest arguments for independence.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Ms Sturgeon also said it would be ""absurd and completely outrageous"" if the UK government went to court over the issue and that it was ""up to the Scottish people"" to decide the country's future. Her party stood on a manifesto to steer the country out of the pandemic, and to then hold a referendum, which she said people had ""voted overwhelmingly for"". She added: ""The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now."" Also appearing on the programme, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he would ""not go near"" the issue of the UK government potentially challenging a referendum bill in court. He said: ""Whatever parties we come from, the priority at the moment is not court cases, it's not independence legislation - it is recovery from the pandemic."" When asked if Scotland was allowed to leave the UK, he said: ""Of course it is, through a legal referendum which would allow people to make that choice."" But he also insisted that the SNP's failure to win an overall majority showed that the people of Scotland were not ""agitating"" for a referendum. The SNP finished on 64 seats in Thursday's Scottish election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016 - while the Conservatives won 31, Labour 22, the pro-independence Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. But Mr Gove said a majority of voters - 51% - had backed parties that were opposed to independence in the constituency ballot - although the same percentage voted for pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove appeared on Marr during a visit to Scotland BBC Scotland's Sunday Show later asked Mr Gove to clarify the indication he gave to Marr that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove said: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principal focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denied he was giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill, saying ""we are concentrating on recovery at the moment"". In her victory speech, Ms Sturgeon said her priority was leading the country through the pandemic - but said she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. In aletter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night, the prime minister invited Ms Sturgeon to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility.""

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to.

"UK minister Michael Gove tells the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Westminster government would not go to court to stop a second Scottish independence referendum Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP's ""historic"" Scottish election win means there is a mandate to hold another vote But she does not believe that the timing of an indyref2 should, or would, be determined in the courts The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority The Scottish Conservatives secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2); and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Boris Johnson has invited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit The Scottish election turnout was 63.2% - the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News There has been further reaction today following the SNP's emphatic victory in Thursday's Scottish Parliament election. Here are some of the key points:  That's all from the live page today. Thanks for joining us.  Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Holyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now. The class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP. It has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women. Among those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories. Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Polling expert Ailsa Henderson says the turnout figure was higher than three of the last six UK general elections in Scotland, though not the last three. At 63.4%, it was up 7.6 percentage points on 2016, meaning an extra 425,000 voted. Prof Henderson says the rise was good for democracy, for participation and engagement in politics. She says extending the right to vote and the ease of access helped with the high turnout. The picture across Scotland as the SNP win a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent It is perhaps understandable that there is lots of talk of
independence and referendums the morning after a Holyrood election, given the
SNP have won big once again. However, there is an argument to be made that the
constitution is not necessarily the most interesting storyline in the wake of
the polls. There is still a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, and
there is still an intense debate about mandates and process. But for all that,
neither side actually wants anything to happen immediately, while there is
still a pandemic to be dealing with. The arguments being exchanged this morning are really rather
familiar, and there is little incentive for anyone to change their tune
straight away â not until the facts on the ground change, such as with the passing
of a referendum bill at Holyrood. And there are some really pressing issues for the SNP in the
coming days and weeks as it forms a new administration. To start with â who will take up key Cabinet posts left
vacant by retiring MSPs? These include the health secretary, during a pandemic; the constitution secretary, as Brexit unfolds; and the environment secretary, in the
year of COP26. And then there are the other big ideas in the SNP manifesto
â things like a National Care Service, a minimum income guarantee, publicly-owned rail services. The constitution was clearly a big issue in the campaign and
thus it is no surprise that it is the focus of intense discussion today. But
there is a lot more to Scottish politics than just the question of
independence. Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh, told the Sunday Show the parties are roughly where they were after the 2016 election. That might lead people to believe it was a boring election, she says, but there is a lot of churn occurring below the surface. Prof Henderson says there are three distinct patterns of voting behaviour on display, what she calls ""a three-Scotland model"". One is areas with strong Yes support at the referendum in 2014. Here the SNP support has held up well and there is relatively little movement among the other parties. In areas with strong No support you see bigger swings among the pro-union parties, she says. The direction of these swings, sometimes in excess of 10 percentage points, depends on how those areas voted in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In stronger Remain areas, pro-union voters have shifted to Labour or sometimes the Lib Dems. In stronger Leave areas (perhaps above 40% in favour of Brexit) you see pro-union voters shifting to the Conservatives. So seven years after Indyref and five years after the Brexit referendum we see that both are still influencing voting in Scottish elections, Prof Henderson says. Lynsey BewsBBC Scotland political correspondent Nicola Sturgeon has been on TV this morning stressing that the ability to hold an independence referendum is a fundamental issue of democracy. She says she has been saying that for a long time. Remember the SNP said they already had a mandate for a second referendum after the 2016 election and they say this result adds to that. There has been debate over whether the UK government would mount a legal challenge should the SNP administration proceed with its own legislation for a referendum. Michael Gove didn't really want to be drawn on any of that this morning. He wanted to deflect and turn the talk on to pandemic recovery. We are really just seeing this continuation of the debate that already existed, slightly intensified by the election we had. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon joined some of the SNP's newly-elected MSPs for a photocall during a visit to Airdrie, North
Lanarkshire. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout. Some 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full 10 percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls. It is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. The rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees. And the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted. People might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown. Indeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Pam Gosal told the Sunday Show she was very proud to be the first Indian Sikh to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. Ms Gosal was elected as a Conservative MSP for the West of Scotland region. Along with Kaukab Stewart of the SNP, who was elected to represent the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. They were the first women of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament in its 22-year history. While Ms Stewart first stood for election in 1999, Ms Gosal says she has only been in politics for one-and-a-half years. She says the Scottish Conservatives supported her to be able to stand and get elected so quickly. Ms Gosal adds that she will be ""calling out"" any abuse from internet trolls and keyboard warriors as she goes about her business at Holyrood. Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater says she is delighted to have won the largest Green group ever at Holyrood. The party won eight seats, up two from 2016. Ms Slater says: ""I think it'll give us significantly more influence. Having the SNP as a minority government means that with every single piece of legislation they need to work with another party. ""Whenever they choose to work with us we can push them to be more progressive, to be fairer, to be greener, to be more environmentally concerned."" Ms Slater says her party's position is different to the SNP on many issues but the Greens were good at amending legislation to make it greener and fairer.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show the Scottish people voted in an election for the parliament to use the powers it has and another independence referendum is outside its remit. He says the people he spoke to were voting for recovery from the Covid pandemic. Mr Ross says he had to put blocking an independence referendum at the forefront of his campaign because the SNP had put holding the vote at the heart of its push. He says he has spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and he wants all the UK nations to work together to deliver the recovery from Covid.  Asked about voters who say Labour has left them, Anas Sarwar says
he doesnât think people should be considering the politics of 20 years ago. The country has changed because of the independence referendum, Brexit
and Covid, and Scottish Labour  can not revert back to the politics that won the General election in 1997, he says. ""It isnât going to work in 2021,"" Mr Sarwar tells the Sunday Show. ""Weâve got to confront the world as it
is and have vision about where we want to take the country. âI want us to unite our country. I want us to have a politics
of hope and empathy, but also transform what we are as a nation in terms of
being an outward looking nation, thatâs fighting poverty, thatâs getting its
NHS back on track and building the education system so it can be the best in
the world."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party has done well despite having fewer Holyrood seats. ""I think you need to remember where we were 10 weeks ago,"" he says, referring to the opinion polls before he became leader of the party. Scotland hasnât had a good opposition, he adds, but âLabour is back on
the pitchâ. He says he will push for Covid recovery first and work to unite the country. He promises to work with any other party willing to fulfil their election promises on the recovery. ""Yes we will have big disagreements,"" he says. ""But that will not stop me working with them."" Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all of its major reforms. If it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead. The Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes. It also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts SNP deputy leader Keith Brown says the first 100 days of the new government will be dedicated to making sure we get through Covid. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be back behind her desk at Bute House this afternoon to get on with that. Mr Brown says the SNP's massive victory gives them a mandate for a second independence referendum. And he adds that the referendum will happen when it is safe to hold one. Mr Brown says he is ""very confident"" an independence referendum will result in success for the Yes side. There is no question the pandemic has changed the financial fundamentals and an independent Scotland will have to deal with that, he says. There will be a detailed White Paper setting out the proposals before an independence campaign begins, he adds. Here's a reminder of some of the key points from the Scottish election results: Mr Gove is asked if he has concerns about his party's performance in Scotland after the SNP was returned to government for a fourth successive term. He says: ""Let's look at the facts, Nicola Sturgeon did not secure a majority. Good result but not a majority as Alex Salmond did in 2011. ""Secondly, the proportion of votes for pro-union parties in the constituencies was more than 50%. ""Third, we had, not just 31 MSPs being re-elected but also the biggest vote for the Scottish Conservatives in the history of Holyrood."" Mr Gove says it is the best result ever for the Scottish Conservatives. BBC Scotland's Sunday Show asks Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to clarify the indication he gave to the Andrew Marr show that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove says: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principle focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denies he is giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill. ""Nope, what we are concentrating on is recovery at the moment,"" he says. Mr Gove says he will not be drawn down the cul-de-sac of a constitutional rammy. ""My sense is people in Scotland don't want their politicians to be having abstract arguments about the Supreme Court, they want them to be relentlessly focused on making sure we have recovery first and foremost,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon is asked if there is any chance of a personal rapprochement between herself and former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond. Sturgeon replies: ""I donât think Alex Salmond and I are going to go back to the way things were but there is nothing about what has happened around Alex Salmond in the last few years that gives me any pleasure whatsoever, it is a source of quite deep sadness to me. ""That's personal obviously - the politics are separate."" Ms Sturgeon says she has the energy and appetite to take Scotland through Covid ""and then I hope to lead Scotland to independence"". ""But the future of Scotland, and I hope the independent future Scotland, is much bigger than any one individual politician,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent is the Queen's first cousin Prince Michael of Kent was willing to use his royal status for personal profit, and provide access to Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime,a Sunday Times and Channel 4 report says.,external The Queen's cousin was filmed at a meeting in which undercover reporters were told he could be hired to make representations to the Kremlin. His friend, the Marquess of Reading, later described him as ""Her Majesty's unofficial ambassador to Russia"". The prince, 78, has denied the claims. And in a statement, his spokesperson said that the marquess had ""made suggestions which Prince Michael would not have wanted, or been able, to fulfil"" during the covertly-recorded meeting. They added: ""As is standard practice, Prince Michael's private secretary made it clear to the company's representatives during their conversations that nothing could proceed without the agreement of the British Embassy and the help of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, of which Prince Michael is patron."" Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Royal Family tree and line of succession The Sunday Times and Channel 4's Dispatches allege that the marquess described Prince Michael as being able to meet Mr Putin and make representations on behalf of a company set up by the reporters. The marquess is said to have warned them that the prince's services were ""confidential"", adding: ""We're talking relatively discreetly here because we wouldn't want the world to know that he is seeing Putin purely for business reasons."" He estimated the prince could charge clients in the region of Â£50,000 for a five-day trip to Russia, the report claimed. The prince is also said to have appeared willing to give the fictitious company his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a fee of $200,000 (Â£143,000), and to use his home at Kensington Palace as a backdrop. Prince Michael's office denied to the Sunday Times that he had a ""special relationship"" with the Russian president and said in a statement that he had not been in contact with Mr Putin or his office for almost 18 years. The newspaper said the marquess later sent an email to the reporters which it described as suggesting he might have regretted being too candid about the prince and Russia. The email said any arrangement would be subject to the prince's advisers to make sure everything was correct. In a statement reported by the newspaper, the marquess said he had made a mistake and ""over-promised"" during the meeting with the undercover reporters and for that he was ""truly regretful"". The Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are not working members of the Royal Family but have represented the Queen in the past. Before the pandemic, they attended around 200 engagements a year, according tothe Royal Family website,external. The website includes a biography which describes the prince as being ""connected to Russia through his maternal grandmother"" and as having ""a strong interest in the country"". The biography said he ""became the first member of the Royal Family to learn Russian, ultimately qualifying as a Russian interpreter"". The prince and princess do not receive public money. He earns a living through a long-established consultancy company and the couple pay market rent and fees for their home at Kensington Palace, a spokesperson for the prince said.

Thanks for stopping by and don't forget you can catch up on all the day's Premier League action by watchingMatch of the Day 2on BBC One and online from 22:30 BST. See you later! FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion Speaking to BT Sport, managerSam Allardycewas also asked whether he'll stay in charge at West Brom and look to bring them straight back up. ""It's too early to talk about that,"" he said. ""For me, it's about getting over the disappointment and when the time is right I'll talk about what's going to happen next season. ""At this moment in time, it's not a question I'm prepared to answer."" West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Sam Allardyce talking to MOTD:""It has been looking difficult for a while and we haven't taken our chance to give ourselves a better opportunity of staying up. ""I think these players should be fighting to stay out of it. They have performed well enough but our capabilities of scoring have deserted us. ""It is a disappointing night but we have to take it on the chin. It is not as painful for me as it is for the club or players. It is painful, I wanted it for the club and players more than me, but it hasn't happened. Everyone has to accept it and recover quickly."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Sport about importance of bouncing back:""The best way to do it is with the right attitude. ""The three goals were very different but really good individual and collective actions."" On Emile Smith Rowe scoring his first Premier League goal:""He is developing the right way but his first Premier League goal. His level is to do that and score 15 goals. He is making the right steps."" On Arsenal and the future:""We have done so many right steps, some you can see and some you can't. The foundations are there."" On feeling after Europa League exit:""I do take it, it is still there, still hurting. You can probably see in my body language it is still there. There were very small margins. I still feel very responsible."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion Manager Sam Allardyce speaking to BT Sport:""We took the game to Arsenal, because we had to, and we had opportunities to take the lead but failed to find the right ball or produce the right finish. ""Then in five minutes of sloppiness, Arsenal showed the quality of finishing we couldn't find. In the second half, instead of going under, we came out fighting. ""We had to wait for an absolutely brilliant goal by Matheus Pereira yet we had much better opportunities than that one. We had chances to convert and didn't do it, and that's probably been the most disappointing thing over the last 14-15 games - it was so near yet so far. ""Then right at the end we saw the difference in quality between the two sides with the free-kick which put them 3-1 up. ""I thought that was a bit flattering for them on the basis of the whole 90 minutes but it's something we've been suffering from for a while. While performances were good and I couldn't ask for too much more from the players tonight, it wasn't quite good enough.""  FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BT Sport:""We needed that win. It has been a while since we won at home. We scored three fantastic goals and we had some great spells in the game. When we conceded the goal we did look nervy. ""We knew the necessity to win the game. They scored out of nothing and then throw everything at you, they know the situation they are in and we struggled to play that kind of game. ""We scored three fantastic goals but we missed some big chances too. ""Europe is a completely different game, different context. There were things we could have done much better. ""Going forwards we know Saka is a threat, he gives you something unique. He adapted. We believed we were going to attack against them and he gave us a lot of joy. ""We will try to win every match and see where we finish. The only thing we can do is win our games."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion Manager Sam Allardyce speaking to BT Sport about West Brom being relegated:""It's not sunk in yet, but I'm sure I'll wake up tomorrow and realise the situation. I'm bitterly disappointed we're not still in the fight. ""I'm not saying we would have avoided relegation but we should have been closer, we should have taken it down to the last three games, based on how we performed. The creating of chances has been there but the converting has not. ""We had [enough] time to pull it round,"" Allardyce added. ""Our real problem was not beating the bottom-six sides when we came up against them. That would have given us a better chance of survival. The results against Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City should have been bonus points."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom West Bromwich Albion West Brom's Kyle Bartley, speaking to BBC Sport:""Massively disappointed. It is time to focus on these next three games, get as much momentum as possible to make sure we come straight back up next season. ""I am really proud of the way the boys kept going. It would have been so easy to fold out there and lost four or five nil but everyone kept going. ""Hopefully we can get the manager situation sorted out as soon as possible. ""We need to try and take as much momentum into next season as possible."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Relegation is a horrible, deflating feeling and an awful thing to experience - plus there is the knock-on affect on the club, with jobs etc.. So for Sam Allardyce to experience and share that with his players is not easy and I'm sure it will consume most of his thoughts. FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Arsenal Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe, speaking to BT Sport:""We started a bit slow, our heads have been down for a couple of days. It was important for us to bounce back. I felt we got into the game in the second half and we are really happy with the three points. ""It has been a dream playing for this club and to finally score my first goal - can't be better. ""It has been a difficult week but happy to get the three points. ""It has been really difficult for us as a team, it is not nice to lose in the semi-final of a tournament, it is important we keep our heads up."" How much do you enjoy playing with Saka?""So much, I was saying to him before that he had to assist me, I've assisted him a few times this season. It was good to get the goal together. ""We are all going to fight for each other until the end."" FT: Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Mikel Arteta really needed that, and Arsenal needed those flashes of brilliance with those goals. They have answered a couple of questions tonight and the goals from Willian and Pepe were fabulous, plus two really strong performances from Saka and Smith Rowe. Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal 3-1 West Brom All over and it's victory for Arsenal as they bounce back from their Europa League disappointment. West Brom, meanwhile, are relegated to the Championship. Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live They are still having a go, all credit to West Brom, they are showing a real good attitude towards the end of this game. They are still working hard even if the quality to unlock Arsenal hasn't been there this evening. Arsenal 3-1 West Brom That's Willian's first goal from a direct free kick in the Premier League since July 2020 for Chelsea (v West Ham). Arsenal 3-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live We can say all we want about Arsenal's performance, which has been indifferent, but what they have had is real quality in key moments. What a goal that was by Willian. The distance and position of the free-kick was perfect, but he executed it so well. Willian and Pepe's goal, two top class finishes from Arsenal this evening. Willian A cracker! Williangets his first for Arsenal with a brilliant free kick, bending it over the wall, out of Sam Johnstone's reach and into the back of the net. Arsenal heading for three points, West Brom heading for the Championship. Arsenal 2-1 West Brom Willian is fouled just outside the box and Arsenal have a late free kick in a decent position... Arsenal 2-1 West Brom Four minutes plus injury time remaining. West Brom have given it a good go but bar an incredible final few minutes their relegation to the Championship is on the verge of being confirmed. Arsenal 2-1 West Brom Matt UpsonFormer England and West Ham defender on BBC Radio 5 Live There's not a lot of cutting edge from West Brom. They have got into some good areas of the pitch and applied some pressure, but bar a piece of magic from Pereira they have not created much, you can see why they have struggled. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Michael Gove says ""all being well"" the UK PM will confirm a relaxation of restrictions in England from 17 May Asked whether a ban on hugging would be lifted he said ""friendly contact"" was something the government wanted to see UK reports two more deaths from Covid-19 on Sunday, and 1,770 new cases Scientists call for the Champions League final to be moved from Turkey to the UK Doctors in India are reporting cases of a rare infection among recovering and recovered Covid-19 patients Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions, state media report Meghan Markle says women have been ""disproportionately affected"" by the pandemic People take to the streets in Spain to celebrate the end of a state of emergency Edited by Thom Poole We're bringing our live coverage today to an end shortly, but before we do here's a reminder of the main news: The South East Asian country of Laos has recorded its first death from coronavirus since the pandemic began. The victim was a 53-year-old Vietnamese woman who had underlying medical problems, including diabetes, state media reported. Infections have rocketed in the country of seven million since last month, when the worst surges also began in neighbouring Thailand and Cambodia. Laos has still identified only 1,302 infections since the pandemic began.  US President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July The US is ""turning the corner"" on the pandemic, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients has said. But he also stressed the importance of all Americans getting vaccinated. Speaking to CNN,external, Zients said 58% of adult Americans had received at least one dose, while more than 110 million had been fully vaccinated. Asked about the vaccination rate slowing down and how hesitant groups were being targeted, Zients said: ""We want everyone to get vaccinated and we have enough supply for all adults Americans to get vaccinated. We just want to make it easier and easier for people to get vaccinated. ""And for those who do have questions about efficacy or about safety, the three authorised vaccines are all very safe and very effective, so we want people to be able to turn to their trusted leader in their neighbourhood - their doctor, their faith leader - to get information about the vaccines, to build vaccine confidence so all Americans get vaccinated."" US President Joe Biden haslaid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 Julyand roll out the shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. In the Philippines, a second surge in Covid-19 cases is putting renewed pressure on the healthcare system. The country currently has the second highest number of cases in South East Asia behind Indonesia. And with one of the longest and hardest lockdowns in the world, a crippling recession has forced thousands on to the streets in search of food. Howard Johnson reports. This video can not be played Philippines Covid surge throws country into disarray The EU has not renewed its order for AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine beyond June, the bloc's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has said. The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech as reliable partners that deliver on their commitments. Read more here on why the EU is suing AstraZeneca. The UK has recorded another two Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There were also a further 1,770 cases reported on Sunday, according tothe government's dashboard,external. Vaccinations continued with 607,864 total jabs on Saturday - 169,027 were first doses while 438,837 were second doses. Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Chelsea and Man City will meet each other in the Champions League Final Scientists on the Independent Sage committee have called for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea to be moved to the UK from Turkey to reduce Covid risks. The final is due to take place in Istanbul on 29 May. But the UK government this week said fans of both clubsshould not travel to Turkeyfor the final after it was added to England's travel red list. In a statement the Independent Sage committee said: âWe wholeheartedly endorse negotiations between the FA and Uefa to relocate the Champions league final to the United Kingdom in order to give the most fans the best chance of attending in the safest possible environment."" Transport secretary Grant Shapps this week said the government was open to hosting the game in the UK. A third of adults in England have now had both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, NHS England says. Latest data shows that 14,871,208 people aged 18 and over have received their first and second dose of the jab, with more than two thirds of adults having already had their first jab. A total of 44,449,424 vaccines have been delivered. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: âReaching this milestone is no accident - it is down to months of hard work and everyone in the NHS who has played a role in this is helping to protect millions of people from serious illness and saving lives."" Cases are dropping slightly in the city but authorities do not want to squander progress Delhi has extended and tightened its lockdown, as cases slowly drop in the city. ""The positivity rate has gone down but still we can't afford leniency,"" Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said. The lockdown will now continue until 17 May, and additional restrictions will come into force - including the closure of the Metro and a ban on public marriage ceremonies. Mr Kejriwal also thanked the people of the city for helping bring down infections. ""Everyone adhered to the norms of the lockdown. We have not done this as a favour to anyone else, this is a matter of our own lives and health"" he said. Authorities imposed a lockdown on 20 April as cases soared in India. The country is grappling with a devastating second wave, with overwhelmed hospitals short on beds, oxygen and medical supplies. Earlier today, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove hinted that hugging would be allowed again when coronavirus restrictions are eased further on 17 May. But how safe is it? Catherine Noakes, a specialist in airborne infections at the University of Leeds, says we should hug in moderation and gave these tips to keep safe. This video can not be played Covid: Tips on hugging safely We've heard a lot this morning about the next stage in the government's roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions in England. But what about upcoming changes to rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? Remember, all rule changes are subject to approval by the devolved administrations - with decisions made this week. InScotland, up to four people from no more than two households can socialise indoors in a private home from 17 May. Up to six adults from three households can meet in an indoor public place (such as a bar), and up to eight adults from eight households can meet anywhere outdoors. InWales, pubs, restaurants, museums and cafes can reopen indoors from 17 May. Cinemas, theatres and museums can also reopen. People inNorthern Irelandhave to wait a little longer for the next set of restrictions to ease. From 24 May, indoor hospitality, including pubs and hotels, reopens. Indoor group exercise will also be allowed and some indoor household mixing in private residences. Read more about all the ruleshere. New Zealand health officials have cleared the way for quarantine-free flights to resume to Sydney after fears of a Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales eased. Flights were suspended on Thursday after two people in Sydney tested positive for the virus. It was the third disruption since the quarantine-free travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia opened on 18 April, almost 400 days after both closed their international borders due to the pandemic. The earlier stoppages to flights to and from Western Australia lasted only a few days and the current travel pause with New South Wales would end at midnight on Sunday. ""The current assessment from New Zealand public health officials is that the risk to New Zealand from New South Wales remains low,"" the health ministry said in a statement. The US has administered some 250 million doses of vaccines to its population, more than 75 doses per 100 people.It's one of the world's most successful vaccination programmes, with President Joe Biden aiming to vaccinate 70% of the country by 4 July. But demand for doses seems to be slowing, and the rate of vaccination is plummeting. According to the Associated Press,states across the US are asking for fewer and fewer jabs,externalfrom the federal government, causing a growing stockpile of vaccines. Doses are allocated by population size, and state governments can then request how many they want each week. Iowa has asked for 29% of its allocated doses; Connecticut 26%; South Carolina 21%; and Iowa and Wisconsin just 9% and 8%, respectively. Last week President Biden said his administration was working to win over ""doubters"" about the shots.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked About seven million Germans are fully vaccinated Both the EU and UK have seen heated debates on whether or not to let people who have had the jab do more than those who have not. From Sunday, everyone in Germany who has been fully vaccinated is now exempt from many restrictions across the country, according to new legislation there. There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses. But they'll still have to observe social distancing rules and wear a mask on public transport. The EU has already announced plans for a vaccine passport - known as a digital green certificate - which will cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered. Until that comes into force though, Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller has advised Germans to carry proof of vaccination - otherwise it will be ""damn difficult to check"" if they were exempt from rules or not, AFP news agency reported. South Africa has confirmed four cases of a new Covid variant that first appeared in India. All four were people who had a history of travel to India. They were found in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The health ministry said 11 cases of the UK variant B.1.1.7 have also been detected. South Africa is the hardest hit nation on the continent, recording more infections and deaths than any other country there. According to Johns Hopkins University data, the country has reported nearly 1.6 million cases and a death toll of more than 54,000. You can read more about the India variant - as well as the UK, South Africa and Brazil variants -here  This video can not be played Covid India variant: What is a variant of concern? If you are just joining us, here's a recap of the main coronavirus stories so far. In the UK, the government is looking ahead to further easing, but in India the situation remains grave. A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams. New York City has noted the success of that shift - and has decided to do away with snow days because of it. ""We are sad for a year without snow days,"" NYCDOE spokeswoman Danielle Filson told CNN. ""But we must meet the state mandate [of 180 days of schooling] and we can leverage the technology we invested in during the pandemic so our students get the instructional days required by the state,"" she said. Students, parents and teachers all criticised the move, defending the great pleasure of a snow day - when public schools are closed due to heavy snow fall or other extreme weather.

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor. In a Tweet, Reeves said she was ""honoured"" to take the role: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labour reshuffle was triggered when Sir Keir Starmersacked Angela Raynerfrom her role as party chair and campaign coordinator, following poor results in the English local elections.

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor. In a Tweet, Reeves said she was ""honoured"" to take the role: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"UK minister Michael Gove tells the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Westminster government would not go to court to stop a second Scottish independence referendum Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP's ""historic"" Scottish election win means there is a mandate to hold another vote But she does not believe that the timing of an indyref2 should, or would, be determined in the courts The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority The Scottish Conservatives secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2); and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Boris Johnson has invited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit The Scottish election turnout was 63.2% - the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News There has been further reaction today following the SNP's emphatic victory in Thursday's Scottish Parliament election. Here are some of the key points:  That's all from the live page today. Thanks for joining us.  Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Holyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now. The class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP. It has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women. Among those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories. Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Polling expert Ailsa Henderson says the turnout figure was higher than three of the last six UK general elections in Scotland, though not the last three. At 63.4%, it was up 7.6 percentage points on 2016, meaning an extra 425,000 voted. Prof Henderson says the rise was good for democracy, for participation and engagement in politics. She says extending the right to vote and the ease of access helped with the high turnout. The picture across Scotland as the SNP win a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent It is perhaps understandable that there is lots of talk of
independence and referendums the morning after a Holyrood election, given the
SNP have won big once again. However, there is an argument to be made that the
constitution is not necessarily the most interesting storyline in the wake of
the polls. There is still a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, and
there is still an intense debate about mandates and process. But for all that,
neither side actually wants anything to happen immediately, while there is
still a pandemic to be dealing with. The arguments being exchanged this morning are really rather
familiar, and there is little incentive for anyone to change their tune
straight away â not until the facts on the ground change, such as with the passing
of a referendum bill at Holyrood. And there are some really pressing issues for the SNP in the
coming days and weeks as it forms a new administration. To start with â who will take up key Cabinet posts left
vacant by retiring MSPs? These include the health secretary, during a pandemic; the constitution secretary, as Brexit unfolds; and the environment secretary, in the
year of COP26. And then there are the other big ideas in the SNP manifesto
â things like a National Care Service, a minimum income guarantee, publicly-owned rail services. The constitution was clearly a big issue in the campaign and
thus it is no surprise that it is the focus of intense discussion today. But
there is a lot more to Scottish politics than just the question of
independence. Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh, told the Sunday Show the parties are roughly where they were after the 2016 election. That might lead people to believe it was a boring election, she says, but there is a lot of churn occurring below the surface. Prof Henderson says there are three distinct patterns of voting behaviour on display, what she calls ""a three-Scotland model"". One is areas with strong Yes support at the referendum in 2014. Here the SNP support has held up well and there is relatively little movement among the other parties. In areas with strong No support you see bigger swings among the pro-union parties, she says. The direction of these swings, sometimes in excess of 10 percentage points, depends on how those areas voted in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In stronger Remain areas, pro-union voters have shifted to Labour or sometimes the Lib Dems. In stronger Leave areas (perhaps above 40% in favour of Brexit) you see pro-union voters shifting to the Conservatives. So seven years after Indyref and five years after the Brexit referendum we see that both are still influencing voting in Scottish elections, Prof Henderson says. Lynsey BewsBBC Scotland political correspondent Nicola Sturgeon has been on TV this morning stressing that the ability to hold an independence referendum is a fundamental issue of democracy. She says she has been saying that for a long time. Remember the SNP said they already had a mandate for a second referendum after the 2016 election and they say this result adds to that. There has been debate over whether the UK government would mount a legal challenge should the SNP administration proceed with its own legislation for a referendum. Michael Gove didn't really want to be drawn on any of that this morning. He wanted to deflect and turn the talk on to pandemic recovery. We are really just seeing this continuation of the debate that already existed, slightly intensified by the election we had. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon joined some of the SNP's newly-elected MSPs for a photocall during a visit to Airdrie, North
Lanarkshire. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout. Some 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full 10 percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls. It is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. The rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees. And the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted. People might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown. Indeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Pam Gosal told the Sunday Show she was very proud to be the first Indian Sikh to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. Ms Gosal was elected as a Conservative MSP for the West of Scotland region. Along with Kaukab Stewart of the SNP, who was elected to represent the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. They were the first women of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament in its 22-year history. While Ms Stewart first stood for election in 1999, Ms Gosal says she has only been in politics for one-and-a-half years. She says the Scottish Conservatives supported her to be able to stand and get elected so quickly. Ms Gosal adds that she will be ""calling out"" any abuse from internet trolls and keyboard warriors as she goes about her business at Holyrood. Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater says she is delighted to have won the largest Green group ever at Holyrood. The party won eight seats, up two from 2016. Ms Slater says: ""I think it'll give us significantly more influence. Having the SNP as a minority government means that with every single piece of legislation they need to work with another party. ""Whenever they choose to work with us we can push them to be more progressive, to be fairer, to be greener, to be more environmentally concerned."" Ms Slater says her party's position is different to the SNP on many issues but the Greens were good at amending legislation to make it greener and fairer.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show the Scottish people voted in an election for the parliament to use the powers it has and another independence referendum is outside its remit. He says the people he spoke to were voting for recovery from the Covid pandemic. Mr Ross says he had to put blocking an independence referendum at the forefront of his campaign because the SNP had put holding the vote at the heart of its push. He says he has spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and he wants all the UK nations to work together to deliver the recovery from Covid.  Asked about voters who say Labour has left them, Anas Sarwar says
he doesnât think people should be considering the politics of 20 years ago. The country has changed because of the independence referendum, Brexit
and Covid, and Scottish Labour  can not revert back to the politics that won the General election in 1997, he says. ""It isnât going to work in 2021,"" Mr Sarwar tells the Sunday Show. ""Weâve got to confront the world as it
is and have vision about where we want to take the country. âI want us to unite our country. I want us to have a politics
of hope and empathy, but also transform what we are as a nation in terms of
being an outward looking nation, thatâs fighting poverty, thatâs getting its
NHS back on track and building the education system so it can be the best in
the world."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party has done well despite having fewer Holyrood seats. ""I think you need to remember where we were 10 weeks ago,"" he says, referring to the opinion polls before he became leader of the party. Scotland hasnât had a good opposition, he adds, but âLabour is back on
the pitchâ. He says he will push for Covid recovery first and work to unite the country. He promises to work with any other party willing to fulfil their election promises on the recovery. ""Yes we will have big disagreements,"" he says. ""But that will not stop me working with them."" Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all of its major reforms. If it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead. The Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes. It also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts SNP deputy leader Keith Brown says the first 100 days of the new government will be dedicated to making sure we get through Covid. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be back behind her desk at Bute House this afternoon to get on with that. Mr Brown says the SNP's massive victory gives them a mandate for a second independence referendum. And he adds that the referendum will happen when it is safe to hold one. Mr Brown says he is ""very confident"" an independence referendum will result in success for the Yes side. There is no question the pandemic has changed the financial fundamentals and an independent Scotland will have to deal with that, he says. There will be a detailed White Paper setting out the proposals before an independence campaign begins, he adds. Here's a reminder of some of the key points from the Scottish election results: Mr Gove is asked if he has concerns about his party's performance in Scotland after the SNP was returned to government for a fourth successive term. He says: ""Let's look at the facts, Nicola Sturgeon did not secure a majority. Good result but not a majority as Alex Salmond did in 2011. ""Secondly, the proportion of votes for pro-union parties in the constituencies was more than 50%. ""Third, we had, not just 31 MSPs being re-elected but also the biggest vote for the Scottish Conservatives in the history of Holyrood."" Mr Gove says it is the best result ever for the Scottish Conservatives. BBC Scotland's Sunday Show asks Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to clarify the indication he gave to the Andrew Marr show that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove says: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principle focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denies he is giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill. ""Nope, what we are concentrating on is recovery at the moment,"" he says. Mr Gove says he will not be drawn down the cul-de-sac of a constitutional rammy. ""My sense is people in Scotland don't want their politicians to be having abstract arguments about the Supreme Court, they want them to be relentlessly focused on making sure we have recovery first and foremost,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon is asked if there is any chance of a personal rapprochement between herself and former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond. Sturgeon replies: ""I donât think Alex Salmond and I are going to go back to the way things were but there is nothing about what has happened around Alex Salmond in the last few years that gives me any pleasure whatsoever, it is a source of quite deep sadness to me. ""That's personal obviously - the politics are separate."" Ms Sturgeon says she has the energy and appetite to take Scotland through Covid ""and then I hope to lead Scotland to independence"". ""But the future of Scotland, and I hope the independent future Scotland, is much bigger than any one individual politician,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries.

Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice.

The US has administered some 250 million doses of vaccines to its population, more than 75 doses per 100 people.It's one of the world's most successful vaccination programmes, with President Joe Biden aiming to vaccinate 70% of the country by 4 July. But demand for doses seems to be slowing, and the rate of vaccination is plummeting. According to the Associated Press,states across the US are asking for fewer and fewer jabs,externalfrom the federal government, causing a growing stockpile of vaccines. Doses are allocated by population size, and state governments can then request how many they want each week. Iowa has asked for 29% of its allocated doses; Connecticut 26%; South Carolina 21%; and Iowa and Wisconsin just 9% and 8%, respectively. Last week President Biden said his administration was working to win over ""doubters"" about the shots.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked About seven million Germans are fully vaccinated Both the EU and UK have seen heated debates on whether or not to let people who have had the jab do more than those who have not. From Sunday, everyone in Germany who has been fully vaccinated is now exempt from many restrictions across the country, according to new legislation there. There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses. But they'll still have to observe social distancing rules and wear a mask on public transport. The EU has already announced plans for a vaccine passport - known as a digital green certificate - which will cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered. Until that comes into force though, Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller has advised Germans to carry proof of vaccination - otherwise it will be ""damn difficult to check"" if they were exempt from rules or not, AFP news agency reported. South Africa has confirmed four cases of a new Covid variant that first appeared in India. All four were people who had a history of travel to India.

If you are just joining us, here's a recap of the main coronavirus stories so far. In the UK, the government is looking ahead to further easing, but in India the situation remains grave. A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams. New York City has noted the success of that shift - and has decided to do away with snow days because of it. ""We are sad for a year without snow days,"" NYCDOE spokeswoman Danielle Filson told CNN. ""But we must meet the state mandate [of 180 days of schooling] and we can leverage the technology we invested in during the pandemic so our students get the instructional days required by the state,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling. LNER passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: ScotRail between Aberdeen and Edinburgh Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough CrossCountry between Leeds, York and Edinburgh Rail replacement coaches are operating at York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and also between Doncaster and Peterborough. LNER says affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though new reservations will need to be made.

From Sunday, everyone in Germany who has been fully vaccinated is now exempt from many restrictions across the country, according to new legislation there. There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses. But they'll still have to observe social distancing rules and wear a mask on public transport. The EU has already announced plans for a vaccine passport - known as a digital green certificate - which will cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered. Until that comes into force though, Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller has advised Germans to carry proof of vaccination - otherwise it will be ""damn difficult to check"" if they were exempt from rules or not, AFP news agency reported. South Africa has confirmed four cases of a new Covid variant that first appeared in India. All four were people who had a history of travel to India. They were found in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The health ministry said 11 cases of the UK variant B.1.1.7 have also been detected. South Africa is the hardest hit nation on the continent, recording more infections and deaths than any other country there. According to Johns Hopkins University data, the country has reported nearly 1.6 million cases and a death toll of more than 54,000.

A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams.

Here are some of the key points:  That's all from the live page today. Thanks for joining us.  Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Holyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now. The class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP. It has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women. Among those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories. Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Polling expert Ailsa Henderson says the turnout figure was higher than three of the last six UK general elections in Scotland, though not the last three. At 63.4%, it was up 7.6 percentage points on 2016, meaning an extra 425,000 voted. Prof Henderson says the rise was good for democracy, for participation and engagement in politics. She says extending the right to vote and the ease of access helped with the high turnout. The picture across Scotland as the SNP win a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent It is perhaps understandable that there is lots of talk of
independence and referendums the morning after a Holyrood election, given the
SNP have won big once again. However, there is an argument to be made that the
constitution is not necessarily the most interesting storyline in the wake of
the polls. There is still a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, and
there is still an intense debate about mandates and process. But for all that,
neither side actually wants anything to happen immediately, while there is
still a pandemic to be dealing with. The arguments being exchanged this morning are really rather
familiar, and there is little incentive for anyone to change their tune
straight away â not until the facts on the ground change, such as with the passing
of a referendum bill at Holyrood. And there are some really pressing issues for the SNP in the
coming days and weeks as it forms a new administration. To start with â who will take up key Cabinet posts left
vacant by retiring MSPs? These include the health secretary, during a pandemic; the constitution secretary, as Brexit unfolds; and the environment secretary, in the
year of COP26. And then there are the other big ideas in the SNP manifesto
â things like a National Care Service, a minimum income guarantee, publicly-owned rail services. The constitution was clearly a big issue in the campaign and
thus it is no surprise that it is the focus of intense discussion today. But
there is a lot more to Scottish politics than just the question of
independence. Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh, told the Sunday Show the parties are roughly where they were after the 2016 election. That might lead people to believe it was a boring election, she says, but there is a lot of churn occurring below the surface. Prof Henderson says there are three distinct patterns of voting behaviour on display, what she calls ""a three-Scotland model"". One is areas with strong Yes support at the referendum in 2014. Here the SNP support has held up well and there is relatively little movement among the other parties. In areas with strong No support you see bigger swings among the pro-union parties, she says. The direction of these swings, sometimes in excess of 10 percentage points, depends on how those areas voted in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In stronger Remain areas, pro-union voters have shifted to Labour or sometimes the Lib Dems. In stronger Leave areas (perhaps above 40% in favour of Brexit) you see pro-union voters shifting to the Conservatives. So seven years after Indyref and five years after the Brexit referendum we see that both are still influencing voting in Scottish elections, Prof Henderson says. Lynsey BewsBBC Scotland political correspondent Nicola Sturgeon has been on TV this morning stressing that the ability to hold an independence referendum is a fundamental issue of democracy. She says she has been saying that for a long time. Remember the SNP said they already had a mandate for a second referendum after the 2016 election and they say this result adds to that. There has been debate over whether the UK government would mount a legal challenge should the SNP administration proceed with its own legislation for a referendum. Michael Gove didn't really want to be drawn on any of that this morning. He wanted to deflect and turn the talk on to pandemic recovery. We are really just seeing this continuation of the debate that already existed, slightly intensified by the election we had. First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon joined some of the SNP's newly-elected MSPs for a photocall during a visit to Airdrie, North
Lanarkshire. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout. Some 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full 10 percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls. It is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. The rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees. And the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted. People might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown. Indeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts Pam Gosal told the Sunday Show she was very proud to be the first Indian Sikh to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. Ms Gosal was elected as a Conservative MSP for the West of Scotland region. Along with Kaukab Stewart of the SNP, who was elected to represent the Glasgow Kelvin constituency. They were the first women of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament in its 22-year history. While Ms Stewart first stood for election in 1999, Ms Gosal says she has only been in politics for one-and-a-half years. She says the Scottish Conservatives supported her to be able to stand and get elected so quickly. Ms Gosal adds that she will be ""calling out"" any abuse from internet trolls and keyboard warriors as she goes about her business at Holyrood. Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater says she is delighted to have won the largest Green group ever at Holyrood. The party won eight seats, up two from 2016. Ms Slater says: ""I think it'll give us significantly more influence. Having the SNP as a minority government means that with every single piece of legislation they need to work with another party. ""Whenever they choose to work with us we can push them to be more progressive, to be fairer, to be greener, to be more environmentally concerned."" Ms Slater says her party's position is different to the SNP on many issues but the Greens were good at amending legislation to make it greener and fairer.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show the Scottish people voted in an election for the parliament to use the powers it has and another independence referendum is outside its remit. He says the people he spoke to were voting for recovery from the Covid pandemic. Mr Ross says he had to put blocking an independence referendum at the forefront of his campaign because the SNP had put holding the vote at the heart of its push. He says he has spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and he wants all the UK nations to work together to deliver the recovery from Covid.  Asked about voters who say Labour has left them, Anas Sarwar says
he doesnât think people should be considering the politics of 20 years ago. The country has changed because of the independence referendum, Brexit
and Covid, and Scottish Labour  can not revert back to the politics that won the General election in 1997, he says. ""It isnât going to work in 2021,"" Mr Sarwar tells the Sunday Show. ""Weâve got to confront the world as it
is and have vision about where we want to take the country. âI want us to unite our country. I want us to have a politics
of hope and empathy, but also transform what we are as a nation in terms of
being an outward looking nation, thatâs fighting poverty, thatâs getting its
NHS back on track and building the education system so it can be the best in
the world."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party has done well despite having fewer Holyrood seats. ""I think you need to remember where we were 10 weeks ago,"" he says, referring to the opinion polls before he became leader of the party. Scotland hasnât had a good opposition, he adds, but âLabour is back on
the pitchâ. He says he will push for Covid recovery first and work to unite the country. He promises to work with any other party willing to fulfil their election promises on the recovery. ""Yes we will have big disagreements,"" he says. ""But that will not stop me working with them."" Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all of its major reforms. If it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead. The Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes. It also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease. See the Scottish election results in maps and charts SNP deputy leader Keith Brown says the first 100 days of the new government will be dedicated to making sure we get through Covid. Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be back behind her desk at Bute House this afternoon to get on with that. Mr Brown says the SNP's massive victory gives them a mandate for a second independence referendum. And he adds that the referendum will happen when it is safe to hold one. Mr Brown says he is ""very confident"" an independence referendum will result in success for the Yes side. There is no question the pandemic has changed the financial fundamentals and an independent Scotland will have to deal with that, he says. There will be a detailed White Paper setting out the proposals before an independence campaign begins, he adds. Here's a reminder of some of the key points from the Scottish election results: Mr Gove is asked if he has concerns about his party's performance in Scotland after the SNP was returned to government for a fourth successive term. He says: ""Let's look at the facts, Nicola Sturgeon did not secure a majority. Good result but not a majority as Alex Salmond did in 2011. ""Secondly, the proportion of votes for pro-union parties in the constituencies was more than 50%. ""Third, we had, not just 31 MSPs being re-elected but also the biggest vote for the Scottish Conservatives in the history of Holyrood."" Mr Gove says it is the best result ever for the Scottish Conservatives. BBC Scotland's Sunday Show asks Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to clarify the indication he gave to the Andrew Marr show that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill. Mr Gove says: ""We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principle focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery. ""At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better."" Mr Gove denies he is giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill. ""Nope, what we are concentrating on is recovery at the moment,"" he says. Mr Gove says he will not be drawn down the cul-de-sac of a constitutional rammy. ""My sense is people in Scotland don't want their politicians to be having abstract arguments about the Supreme Court, they want them to be relentlessly focused on making sure we have recovery first and foremost,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon is asked if there is any chance of a personal rapprochement between herself and former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond. Sturgeon replies: ""I donât think Alex Salmond and I are going to go back to the way things were but there is nothing about what has happened around Alex Salmond in the last few years that gives me any pleasure whatsoever, it is a source of quite deep sadness to me. ""That's personal obviously - the politics are separate."" Ms Sturgeon says she has the energy and appetite to take Scotland through Covid ""and then I hope to lead Scotland to independence"". ""But the future of Scotland, and I hope the independent future Scotland, is much bigger than any one individual politician,"" she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech as reliable partners that deliver on their commitments. Read more here on why the EU is suing AstraZeneca. The UK has recorded another two Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There were also a further 1,770 cases reported on Sunday, according tothe government's dashboard,external.

Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected. International visitors were banned from making the journey to Mecca, the only foreigners allowed to attend are those who reside in the kingdom. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice.

New Zealand health officials have cleared the way for quarantine-free flights to resume to Sydney after fears of a Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales eased. Flights were suspended on Thursday after two people in Sydney tested positive for the virus. It was the third disruption since the quarantine-free travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia opened on 18 April, almost 400 days after both closed their international borders due to the pandemic. The earlier stoppages to flights to and from Western Australia lasted only a few days and the current travel pause with New South Wales would end at midnight on Sunday. ""The current assessment from New Zealand public health officials is that the risk to New Zealand from New South Wales remains low,"" the health ministry said in a statement.

The announcement comes a day after the EU agreed a huge extension to its contract with Pfizer-BioNTech, guaranteeing 900 million doses of its vaccines until 2023. The EU has begun legal action against AstraZeneca, accusing the Anglo Swedish firm of not respecting its contract and not having a reliable plan to ensure timely deliveries.

Socially-distanced worshippers praying in Mecca in April 2020 Saudi Arabia will organise this year's pilgrimage to Mecca under special conditions to
guard against the spread of COVID-19, state TV reported on
Sunday. ""The mechanism and conditions for holding the Hajj this year
will be announced later,"" it said, citing the ministry of
pilgrimage, Reuters news agency reported. Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed a limited number of domestic
pilgrims to perform the Hajj. It was scaled back because of the pandemic, with only 10,000 pilgrims expected.

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the government wants to see ""intimate contact between friends"" restored in England. Though Mr Gove was quick to caveat his words with the fact a broader review of social distancing measures is under way, he acknowledged there will be a relaxation of some kind after 17 May. So does this mean people who are not in a relationship or in the same household can meet up indoors from next Monday? According to the roadmap, the answer is yes - well, possibly - and only if Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirms the next step can go ahead. The plan says that, at the third stage of easing England's lockdown, the ""rule of six"" will apply indoors. That means six people from any number of households can socialise inside a private property within the rules - with people asked ""to follow guidance on how to meet safely, for example by minimising the size of
gatherings and meeting outdoors where possible"". But the roadmap document also adds: ""At step three, the government will further ease limits on social contact, enabling the
public to make informed personal decisions. ""It will remain important for people to
consider the risks for themselves, taking into account whether they and those they
meet have been vaccinated or are at greater risk."" We will hear from Mr Johnson tomorrow on what an ""informed personal decision"" might mean in practice.

There are no limits on social contact, and curfews will no longer apply to the seven million Germans who had had both doses.

If you are just joining us, here's a recap of the main coronavirus stories so far. In the UK, the government is looking ahead to further easing, but in India the situation remains grave. A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams. New York City has noted the success of that shift - and has decided to do away with snow days because of it. ""We are sad for a year without snow days,"" NYCDOE spokeswoman Danielle Filson told CNN. ""But we must meet the state mandate [of 180 days of schooling] and we can leverage the technology we invested in during the pandemic so our students get the instructional days required by the state,"" she said.

Ms Sturgeon said her priority was the pandemic but she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. Boris Johnson hasinvited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit. Ms Sturgeon said there was no democratic justification for the prime minister, or anyone else, to attempt to block it. But Mr Johnson said talk of ""ripping our country apart"" would be ""irresponsible and reckless"".

Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external What do the results mean for Scottish independence? In Scotland the SNP won 64 seats, the Conservatives 31, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. Ms Sturgeon said her party had won the most constituency seats and secured the highest share of the constituency vote in the history of devolution. And she pledged that ""the task of building a better Scotland for everyone who lives here will be my priority every single day.""

Ms Sturgeon said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid. She added: ""It is then to kick-start and drive our recovery with an ambitious and transformative programme for government. ""And, yes, when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future. ""All of that is what I promised and all of that is what I intend to deliver."" She said the result of the election meant there was ""no democratic justification whatsoever for Boris Johnson or anyone else seeking to block the right of the people of Scotland to choose our future."" And she insisted that holding a referendum was now ""the will of the country"". Boris Johnson says it would be ""reckless"" to hold a referendum right now The prime minister congratulated Ms Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford on their re-elections and invited them to a meeting ""to discuss our shared challenges and how we can work together in the coming months and years to overcome them"". He phoned Mr Drakeford on Saturday and plans to speak to Ms Sturgeon on Sunday. In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night,he invited her to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross wins seat Scottish Labour on âjourney backâ despite losses Alex Salmond fails in bid to be elected as an MSP But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility."" Prior to the Holyrood election's final results, Mr Johnson wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph that it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to talk about ""ripping our country apart"" with an independence referendum at a time when people wanted to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish voting system was specifically designed to prevent any one party having a majority in the 129-seat parliament - although the SNP did manage to do so in the 2011 election. The SNP, which formed a minority government after the last election in 2016, had hoped that winning another majority in this election would further strengthen its calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence to be held. It would also have allowed the party to pass laws and the Scottish government's annual budget at Holyrood without having to rely on the support of any other party. But there will be another, slightly increased, pro-independence majority in the parliament thanks to the seats allocated to the Scottish Greens through the regional list system and the additional seat won by the SNP. However, the Alba Party - which was formed by former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond - will not win any seats. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the results have seen 51% voters backing pro-UK parties in the constituency ballot - and 51% backing pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her cabinet with four cabinet posts including that of health secretary needing filled as a result of retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath will be her immediate priority â although clearly she intends to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the other 128 MSPs on Thursday before putting herself forward in parliament for re-election as first minister the following week. The SNP won two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives in the constituency results that were declared on Friday. But those wins caused the party to lose seats on the regional list, effectively cancelling out some of the gains it has made. No other constituency seats have changed hands after Thursday's vote, which saw a record turnout for a Scottish Parliament election despite the Covid pandemic.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The SNP has pledged to push forward with legislation for a second Scottish independence referendum and have said they could go to the courts if the UK government attempts to block it. Ms Sturgeon has also said she will not hold an illegal wildcat vote on the issue, arguing that it would not actually lead to Scotland becoming independent because the result would not be recognised by the UK government or the international community. And she has repeatedly stressed that she would only want a referendum to be held once the pandemic is over. Opinion polls suggest that voters are essentially split 50-50 on the question of whether Scotland should be an independent country.

If you are just joining us, here's a recap of the main coronavirus stories so far. In the UK, the government is looking ahead to further easing, but in India the situation remains grave. A vaccination marathon is underway at Bran Castle in Romania Visitors to Bran Castle in Romania this month can expect a jab in the arm rather than a bite in the neck, as the Dracula attraction takes part in a vaccination drive. Health authorities have opened up Bran Castle in Transylvania for jabs every weekend this May, without the need to pre-book. The site is believed to have been an inspiration for Bram Stoker, who wrote the 1897 vampire novel Dracula. Doctors and nurses administered the injections to any interested visitors before they continued on their tour. ""I came to visit the castle with my family and when I saw the poster I gathered up my courage and agreed to get the injection,"" engineer Liviu Necula told AFP news agency. Doctors and nurses gave out the jabs at the castle Romania is using tourist attractions, local vaccination drives and even 24-hour vaccine ""marathons"" to get as many people to take the jab as possible. Some 3.6 million of Romania's 19 million population have had at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Authorities want to have jabbed five million by June, but are struggling to attract interest, with one study by think tank GLOBSEC suggesting thatless than 50% of the population would be willing to get the vaccine,external. It's thought Bran Castle was an inspiration for Bram Stoker when he wrote the novel Dracula Critics are hailing snow days - when school is cancelled due to heavy snow or extreme weather - as one of the great pleasures of childhood Around the world, pupils and teachers had to adapt to remote learning as Covid restrictions shut schools and cancelled exams. New York City has noted the success of that shift - and has decided to do away with snow days because of it. ""We are sad for a year without snow days,"" NYCDOE spokeswoman Danielle Filson told CNN. ""But we must meet the state mandate [of 180 days of schooling] and we can leverage the technology we invested in during the pandemic so our students get the instructional days required by the state,"" she said. Students, parents and teachers all criticised the move, defending the great pleasure of a snow day - when public schools are closed due to heavy snow fall or other extreme weather.

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor.

The Labour reshuffle was triggered when Sir Keir Starmersacked Angela Raynerfrom her role as party chair and campaign coordinator, following poor results in the English local elections. She has now been given the role of shadowing Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office, and will also take the titles shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow secretary for the Future of Work An ally of Rayner said: âAngela obviously comes out of this significantly more
powerful both in terms of the party and policy. She will be much more visible

"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan says he is ""humbled"" by his re-election as mayor of London Labour's Sadiq Khan has won a second term as London's mayor, beating Conservative rival Shaun Bailey. He won 55.2% of the popular vote, after entering a run-off with Mr Bailey when neither managed to secure a majority in the first round of voting. The former MP became the first Muslim mayor of an EU capital city when he was elected to the role in 2016. Speaking at City Hall, he promised ""to strain every sinew to help build a better, brighter future for London"". The Green Party's Sian Berry came third, while the Liberal Democrats' Luisa Porritt was fourth. The Lib Dems lost their deposit, as Ms Porritt failed to win more than 5% of the vote. Elsewhere on Saturday evening, Labour lost overall control of Durham County Council while the Tories continued to make inroads in their traditional heartlands. Sadiq Khan: 'I neverÂ wanted to be a culture war poster boy' Mr Khan was seen as the favourite throughout the campaign, with some pollsters predicting he would win more than half of the first-round votes. The 51-year-old failed to reach his record-setting vote total of 2016, but won with a 228,000-vote majority. Mr Khan's closest rival was Mr Bailey, who received 44.8% of the first and second-round votes, and increased the Conservative vote share by 1.6%. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Speaking after the results were announced, Mr Khan said: ""I will always be a mayor for all Londoners, working to improve the lives of every single person in this city. ""The results of the elections around the UK shows our country, and even our city, remains deeply divided. ""The scars of Brexit have yet to heal. A crude culture war is pushing us further apart."" Sadiq Khan won 69% of second-preference votes Mr Khan continued: ""Economic inequality is getting worse both within London and in different parts of our country. ""As we seek to confront the enormity of the challenge ahead, and as we endeavour to rebuild from this pandemic, we must use this moment of national recovery to heal those damaging divisions."" Shaun Bailey increased the Conservative Party's share of the vote by 1.6% Mr Bailey said he had been ""written off"" by pollsters, journalists and other politicians, adding: ""But Londoners didn't write me off."" He congratulated Mr Khan but said he hoped the re-elected mayor would not ""blame everything on the government"". During his tenure as mayor, Mr Khan has had run-ins with the government over coronavirus restrictions andTransport for London's finances. In the end he won quite comfortably - but it didn't always feel like that. Sadiq Khan's team got panicky on polling day when voting was slow. In fact turnout - though not at 2016 levels - was higher than previous elections unhindered by a pandemic. Then there were jitters on the first day of counting when the margin between Mr Khan and Mr Bailey was narrow on the first constituencies announced. Mr Khan's winning margin as an incumbent mayor eclipses Boris Johnson's in 2012. But this was no Khan procession. In the end Mr Bailey's performance exceeded expectations and utterly defied the grim predictions of numerous polls. Not bad either, given how little resources he appears to have had from a Tory HQ that was focused elsewhere. Mr Khan would have liked today to have been about sheer success - a victory to lift Labour hearts beyond the boundaries of the capital. It's not worked out like that.

"The rocket, which carried a Chinese space station section into orbit, was launched on 29 April The remains of a Chinese rocket that was hurtling back towards Earth have crashed into the Indian Ocean, the country's space agency says. The bulk of the rocket was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere, but state media reported that debris landed just west of the Maldives on Sunday. There have been days of speculation over where the rocket might land, and US officials and other experts warned its return risked potential casualties. But China insisted the risk was low. The Long March-5b vehicle re-entered the atmosphere at 10:24 Beijing time (02:24 GMT) on Sunday, state media reported, citing the Chinese Manned Space Engineering office. There were no reports of injuries or damage. It said debris from the 18-tonne rocket, one of the largest items in decades to have an undirected dive into the atmosphere, landed in the Indian Ocean at a point 72.47Â° East and 2.65Â° North. China launches first module of new space station Space debris removal demonstration launches US Space Command, meanwhile, simply said the rocket had ""re-entered over the Arabian Peninsula"". It did not confirm the landing point reported by Chinese media, saying instead that it was ""unknown if the debris [had] impacted land or water"". The monitoring service Space-Track, which uses US military data, said the rocket was recorded above Saudi Arabia before it fell into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. The uncontrolled return of the rocket led to pointed criticism from the US amid fears that it could land in an inhabited area. US and European websites tracked its return, and there was much speculation on social media about where the debris might land. ""Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth,"" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. ""It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris."" Space experts, however, predicted that the chances of anyone being hit were very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean and huge areas of land are uninhabited. The main segment from the Long March-5b vehicle was used to launch the first module of China's new space station last month. Originally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km (99 miles by 233 miles) above the Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage soon began to lose height. Long March-5B rocket launched the Tianhe module on 29 April Various space debris modelling experts predicted that most of the vehicle would burn up during its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there was always the possibility that metals with high melting points and other resistant materials could survive to the Earth's surface. When a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast in West Africa. China has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object. Commentary in the country's media had described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as ""hype"" and predicted the debris would fall somewhere in international waters. In recent years, China has made no secret of its space ambitions. The country has poured billions of dollars into its space efforts, and in 2019 it became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the endeavours and state media has frequently cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"". The Tiangong space station could be up and running as early as next year - and there is also talk in Chinese media of missions to Mars and a potential shared lunar station with Russia.

"The first global review of complementary medicines for weight loss in 16 years suggests their use cannot be justified based on current evidence. Researchers found that while some herbal and dietary supplements resulted in marginal weight loss compared to a placebo, they did not benefit health. They called for more research into their long-term safety. The sale of diet pills, powders and liquids containing plant or animal products has grown in popularity. The global industry was estimated to be worth $41bn (Â£29.3bn) last year. Appetite drug could mark 'new era' in obesity 'I'll never go back to the gym again' Instagram fixes appetite suppressant mistake Just 20% of new products are audited annually to make sure they provide evidence backing their claims. In some countries, the only requirement is that supplements contain acceptable levels of non-medicinal products. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, clinical evidence for their safety and effectiveness is not required before they hit the market, says the review's lead author Erica Bessell from the University of Sydney. ""Our rigorous assessment of the best available evidence finds that there is insufficient evidence to recommend these supplements for weight loss,"" she said. ""Even though most supplements appear safe for short-term consumption, they are not going to provide weight loss that is clinically meaningful."" The Australian researchers carried out a systematic review of all randomised trials comparing the effect of herbal supplements to placebos (or dummy treatment) on weight loss, up to August 2018. The data was analysed from 54 studies involving 4,331 healthy overweight or obese adults aged 16 years or older. Weight loss of at least 2.5kg (5.5lbs) was considered clinically meaningful. Herbal supplements included in the analysis were green tea, garcinia cambogia, mangosteen, white kidney bean, ephedra, African mango, yerba mate, veld grape, licorice root and East Indian globe thistle. The analysis found that only one of these - white kidney bean - resulted in a statistically, but not clinically, greater weight loss of 1.61kg (3.5Ibs) than the placebo. Some combination preparations containing African mango, veld grape, East Indian globe thistle and mangosteen showed promising results, but were investigated in three or fewer trials, often with poor research methodology or reporting. These findings should be interpreted with caution, researchers say. The researchers also carried out a systematic review, up to December 2019, of 67 randomised trials comparing the effect of dietary supplements to placebos for weight loss in 5,194 healthy overweight or obese adults aged 16 years or older. Dietary supplements included in the analysis were: chitosan, glucomannan, fructans and conjugated linoleic acid. The analysis found that chitosan (-1.84 kg), glucomannan (-1.27 kg), and conjugated linoleic acid (-1.08 kg) resulted in statistically, but not clinically, significant weight loss compared to placebos. Some dietary supplements, including modified cellulose and blood orange juice extract, showed promising results but were only investigated in one trial and need more evidence before recommending them for weight loss, researchers say. ""Herbal and dietary supplements might seem like a quick-fix solution to weight problems, but people need to be aware of how little we actually know about them,"" says Ms Bessell. She said very few high-quality studies had been performed on the supplements, with little data on long-term effectiveness. ""The tremendous growth in the industry and popularity of these products underscores the urgency for conducting larger more rigorous studies to have reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness for weight loss,"" she added. The findings are being presented atThe European Congress on Obesity,externalheld online this year.

The BBC understands Angela Rayner will play a leading role in developing Labour party policy,
particularly in relation to the government's ""levelling up agenda"",
economic policy and workers' rights. A supporter of Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question
about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the
voters in our heartland seats. Angela can answer that question and is the best
person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall."" Rayner remains the partyâs elected deputy leader, and will now also shadow Michael Gove as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  She was also given two new titles - shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. Sir Keir Starmer has promoted Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in his reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. She moves from a junior job as shadow business minister to shadow housing secretary In aTweet,externalshe said: ""Really pleased to become the shadow housing secretary - some really big issues to tackle from cladding, housing crisis, private rented sector, homelessness and providing decent housing for all, to name a few. ""I will really miss my role as shadow business minister and Ed Miliband."" Miliband remains in his position as the party's shadow business and energy secretary. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's not an enormous sweeping reshuffle on some kind of vast scale, but there are some particular changes of note. First of all,Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour party - the bust up with Keir Starmer began all the bitterness and the disputes of this reshuffle today. She will actually go to another big job, she'll be the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a fancy name for being somebody who will be very senior indeed in the team who will face off in the House of Commons against Michael Gove. Shadow chancellor,Anneliese Dodds, has been demoted to become the party chair. She will be replaced byRachel Reeves, somebody who's been prominent in Labour circles for a long time, not somebody who's identified with the left of the party in any way. And one other thing, perhaps not a huge household name, but a name that really matters around these parts, is the veteran chief whip -Nick Brown- he is out. He's put out a statement saying that he and Keir Starmer have left things on perfectly decent terms but in terms of the machinations of how this place works, his departure is something that really will matter. This is certainly not been the kind of day that Keir Starmer would have wanted. A reshuffle is supposed to be about putting a rocket in people's bellies, getting things going. Particularly after Labour had a very patchy set of results with some really tough contests, losing ground to the Tories in many areas that they like to think of as their own. That said, Starmer's allies are saying tonight that he resisted some demands other people were making, he kept his head down, he took longer than they would have wanted and it was messy - but in the end he did manage to get it done. But I think this does give a wobble to Labour's sentiment. He has critics on the left who have already used this as an opportunity to pile in and push him to try to change direction. The shadow cabinet itself is due to meet tomorrow at noon, one wonders quite what the atmosphere will be like in the room. Rachel Reeves has replaced Anneliese Dodds as Labour's shadow chancellor. In a Tweet, Reeves said she was ""honoured"" to take the role: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She has now been given the role of shadowing Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office, and will also take the titles shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow secretary for the Future of Work An ally of Rayner said: âAngela obviously comes out of this significantly more
powerful both in terms of the party and policy. She will be much more visible
now she isn't being held back. âShe will lead both party reform and the development of a
policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters

That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the
British people. Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is
necessary, so Labour must change too. âIn the
last 24 hours we have seen fantastic results for Labour Metro Mayors, as well
as the Labour government in Wales under Mark Drakeford. They have shown the
difference Labour can make in power, standing up for their communities. âWe have
seen Labour begin to turn around its fortunes in Scotland under the leadership
of Anas Sarwar. These results give us optimism and inspiration for the future.
The challenge for us now is to build upon these successes and learn from the
places we lost. âI look
forward to working with our refreshed and renewed team to take on that
challenge, deliver that change and build the ambitious programme that will
deliver the next Labour government.â The leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has re-shuffled some of his

The Labour reshuffle was triggered when Sir Keir Starmersacked Angela Raynerfrom her role as party chair and campaign coordinator, following poor results in the English local elections. She has now been given the role of shadowing Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office, and will also take the titles shadow First Secretary of State, and shadow secretary for the Future of Work An ally of Rayner said: âAngela obviously comes out of this significantly more
powerful both in terms of the party and policy. She will be much more visible
now she isn't being held back. âShe will lead both party reform and the development of a
policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters
we need to win. ""She will set out our vision, develop policy across
the board and lead the fight to win back voters across former Labour heartlands

Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country.
That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the
British people. Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is
necessary, so Labour must change too. âIn the
last 24 hours we have seen fantastic results for Labour Metro Mayors, as well
as the Labour government in Wales under Mark Drakeford. They have shown the
difference Labour can make in power, standing up for their communities. âWe have
seen Labour begin to turn around its fortunes in Scotland under the leadership
of Anas Sarwar. These results give us optimism and inspiration for the future.
The challenge for us now is to build upon these successes and learn from the
places we lost. âI look
forward to working with our refreshed and renewed team to take on that
challenge, deliver that change and build the ambitious programme that will
deliver the next Labour government.â The leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, has re-shuffled some of his
top team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

"The rocket, which carried a Chinese space station section into orbit, was launched on 29 April The remains of a Chinese rocket that was hurtling back towards Earth have crashed into the Indian Ocean, the country's space agency says. The bulk of the rocket was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere, but state media reported that debris landed just west of the Maldives on Sunday. There have been days of speculation over where the rocket might land, and US officials and other experts warned its return risked potential casualties. But China insisted the risk was low. The Long March-5b vehicle re-entered the atmosphere at 10:24 Beijing time (02:24 GMT) on Sunday, state media reported, citing the Chinese Manned Space Engineering office. There were no reports of injuries or damage. It said debris from the 18-tonne rocket, one of the largest items in decades to have an undirected dive into the atmosphere, landed in the Indian Ocean at a point 72.47Â° East and 2.65Â° North. China launches first module of new space station Space debris removal demonstration launches US Space Command, meanwhile, simply said the rocket had ""re-entered over the Arabian Peninsula"". It did not confirm the landing point reported by Chinese media, saying instead that it was ""unknown if the debris [had] impacted land or water"". The monitoring service Space-Track, which uses US military data, said the rocket was recorded above Saudi Arabia before it fell into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. The uncontrolled return of the rocket led to pointed criticism from the US amid fears that it could land in an inhabited area. US and European websites tracked its return, and there was much speculation on social media about where the debris might land. ""Spacefaring nations must minimise the risks to people and property on Earth,"" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. ""It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris."" Space experts, however, predicted that the chances of anyone being hit were very small, not least because so much of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean and huge areas of land are uninhabited. The main segment from the Long March-5b vehicle was used to launch the first module of China's new space station last month. Originally injected into an elliptical orbit approximately 160km by 375km (99 miles by 233 miles) above the Earth's surface on 29 April, the Long March-5b core stage soon began to lose height. Long March-5B rocket launched the Tianhe module on 29 April Various space debris modelling experts predicted that most of the vehicle would burn up during its final plunge through the atmosphere, although there was always the possibility that metals with high melting points and other resistant materials could survive to the Earth's surface. When a similar core stage returned to Earth a year ago, piping assumed to be from the rocket was identified on the ground in Ivory Coast in West Africa. China has bridled at the suggestion that it has been negligent in allowing the uncontrolled return of so large an object. Commentary in the country's media had described Western reports about the potential hazards involved as ""hype"" and predicted the debris would fall somewhere in international waters. In recent years, China has made no secret of its space ambitions. The country has poured billions of dollars into its space efforts, and in 2019 it became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the endeavours and state media has frequently cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation"". The Tiangong space station could be up and running as early as next year - and there is also talk in Chinese media of missions to Mars and a potential shared lunar station with Russia.

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling. LNER passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: ScotRail between Aberdeen and Edinburgh Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough CrossCountry between Leeds, York and Edinburgh Rail replacement coaches are operating at York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and also between Doncaster and Peterborough.

"Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour. Starmer set to reshuffle Labour's top team Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? So far, the Conservatives have made a net gain of 12 councils, while Labour has lost control of eight. There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday. The results of the contest for the newly created role of West Yorkshire mayor will also be announced.

The elections are the biggest test of public opinion since the 2019 general election and the first electoral test for Sir Keir Starmer since he became Labour leader last year. BBC analysis estimatedthe Conservatives would have won a 36% vote share in a nationwide general election, if those who voted in England's local elections behaved in the same way. The projection, based on detailed data from 1,000 key wards, estimated a 29% share for Labour, 17% for the Liberal Democrats and 18% for other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party, which has lost a few council seats but held control of Cheltenham and Eastleigh, was ""moving forwards and making progress"". The Green Party has picked up seats with 70 new councillors, with the party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, saying it felt like a ""green spring is happening"".

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The Conservatives picked up control of several councils, including Southampton, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. The party also celebrated winningthe Hartlepool parliamentary by-election on Friday, taking a Westminster seat which Labour had held since its creation in 1974. And it managed to keep the Tees Valley mayoralty - in an area once considered a Labour stronghold - with Ben Houchen increasing his share of the vote. Labour lost control of councils including Sheffield and Plymouth - although it retained areas including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter. Environment Secretary George Eustice said Labour had been punished in Leave-voting areas by ""wrangling"" over Brexit in recent years. He added that the Conservatives had also reaped the benefit from the successful roll-out of Covid vaccines. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour needed to be ""humble"" in the face of disappointing results, and would be carrying out a ""root and branch"" review of its policies.

"Andy Street has been West Midlands Mayor since 2017 Conservative Andy Street has been re-elected as the West Midlands mayor. The 57-year-old won in the second preference count, with a total of 314,669 votes. Labour's Liam Byrne was unable to make up the 55,309-vote deficit from the first round, picking up 267,626 total votes to come second place. Mr Street, a former managing director of John Lewis, was first elected to the position in 2017 when he defeated Labour's Sion Simon. Votes were counted across the West Midlands, with the main count at the Utilita Arena in Birmingham Following the result, Mr Street thanked ""everyone who has put their faith in me"". ""I want to thank everyone else who's come on board over last four years, and shares our vision for and belief in the renewal of the West Midlands,"" he added. ""It's that growing sense of unity and purpose that makes me certain we will succeed."" PM Boris Johnson visited the region on 5 May to show support for Mr Street Mr Street said the region now ""faces serious challenges"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
