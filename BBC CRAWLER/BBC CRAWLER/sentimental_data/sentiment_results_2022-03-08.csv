"Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre have settled the court case The Duke of York is paying a financial settlement to his accuser Virginia Giuffre - formally ending a civil case brought against him in the US, according to court documents. A judge in New York signed the court papers on Tuesday, marking the final stage of settling the sex assault case. The amount being paid by Prince Andrew in the deal agreed last month has not been revealed. But the court documents say each side will ""bear her/his own costs and fees"". There has been speculation about how Prince Andrew might afford the settlement, which could cost millions of dollars. There have been suggestions he could use funds from selling a ski chalet in Switzerland - but the sale has so far not been completed, according to Prince Andrew's representatives on Tuesday. Prince Andrew settles US sex assault case Prince Andrew loses titles and use of HRH Is there any way back for Prince Andrew? Prince Andrew: Where does he get his money from? A statement from the Treasury, in response to a Freedom of Information request, ruled out any public funding: ""No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees."" There have been suggestions that the Queen could help to pay, using her private funds, but Buckingham Palace had declined to comment. The latest ""stipulation of dismissal"" court papers showed the case being concluded, following the agreement reached between Prince Andrew and Ms Giuffre in February, which stopped the prospect of a courtroom battle in New York. The signing of the papers by US district court judge Lewis Kaplan marks the end of this high-profile legal claim. The out-of-court settlement accepted no liability and Prince Andrew has always strongly rejected claims of wrongdoing. But the prince agreed to pay an unspecified amount to Ms Giuffre and to her charity for victims' rights. He also said he ""never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character"" and he recognised she had ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"". The duke also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association"" with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In the wake of the claims, Prince Andrew lost military titles and royal patronages as well as the use of the title His Royal Highness.

"The UK and EU said they remain determined to find ""durable solutions"" to the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol. The two sides issued a joint statement after a meeting of senior officials. The negotiators met in a body known as the Specialised Committee. It deals with technical issues and can make recommendations to the lead negotiators, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. The statement said: ""Both parties underlined their ongoing determination to ensure that outstanding issues in the context of the protocol are addressed, and durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. ""In addition, the EU and the UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups, civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements."" Officials representing the NI Executive attended the meeting as part of the UK delegation. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ The protocol isthe Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish borderby keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. The EU has agreed in principle that GB goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than those which are due to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. But there is still a big difference between the UK and EU about how that should be implemented and what should be considered a reasonable level of risk to the EU single market. The NI Protocol and its economic impact A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The joint committee previously met in late February. At that time Mrs Truss and Mr Å efÄoviÄ said they weredetermined that outstanding issues would be addressed. A senior EU official suggested that the talks would happen in a more ""discreet"" way in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May. It is not yet clear if, or how, the war in Ukraine will affect the negotiations. Mrs Truss and Mr Å efÄoviÄ have previously made a joint statement expressing a wish for ""a positive EU-UK relationship"" which would allow for ""co-operation on common global challenges"". Last week, Mrs Truss was a guest at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels alongside the US secretary of state and Canada's foreign minister. However, EU and UK sources have both played down the prospect that the changed environment could unlock rapid progress.

"Consumer giants including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have joined the list of firms halting business in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. On Wednesday, Heineken stopped beer production and sales in Russia. And Mothercare said all business in Russia, which represents 20% to 25% of its global sales, had been stopped. Elsewhere, tobacco company Imperial Brands - the group behind brands including JPS and Davidoff cigarettes - said it was pausing production at its factory in Volgograd in a move impacting about 1,000 employees. It has already suspended its operations in Ukraine over staff safety concerns. Russia and Ukraine together accounted for 2% of Imperial's net revenues last year - about Â£656m. Meanwhile, British American Tobacco has halted investment in Russia, but said its business in the country continues to operate. The moves by McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks come after mounting pressure on companies to act over the war in Ukraine. All three firms said they would continue to pay their staff. Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors, told the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme that firms who were joining the wave of firms leaving Russia were doing so because ""shareholders and wider stakeholders wouldn't stand for continued generation of revenues and profits"" from the country, ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she said.

McDonald's established a presence in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was opening its economy, and it drew thousands for its burgers and fries. Its closure now carries similar symbolic weight, and could influence other firms. However, fast-food chain rival Burger King is currently keeping its Russian stores open. It committed $3m (Â£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people fleeing to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. The company told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change currently. McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski said it was ""impossible to predict"" when it would reopen in Russia. McDonalds has also temporarily closed its 108 restaurants in Ukraine. Collectively the countries account for about 9% of the firm's revenue and about 2% of global sales. Companies have been under pressure to act as Russian violence against civilians has escalated. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaColahad both been trending on Twitter over recent days. Dozens of well-known firms includingNetflix and Levi's have already suspended salesor stopped providing services in Russia amid severe sanctions imposed by Western allies. Coca-Cola on Tuesday said it was suspending operations in Russia, which accounted for roughly 2% of the firm's operating revenue and income. It also has a roughly 20% ownership stake in a bottling and distribution business in Russia. ""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" the company said. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia and suspending capital investments and advertising, citing ""horrific events"" in Ukraine. But the company, which started operating in Russia during the Cold War and now employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. ""As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,"" boss Ramon Laguarta said. ""That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food."" Starbucks' plans to stop business in Russia include stopping shipments of its products. The coffee chain's licensee in the country Kuwait-based Alshaya Group will continue to pay its roughly 2,000 staff members. Other major global brands joining the backlash on Tuesday included the world's largest music company, Universal Music Group, which said it was suspending all operations in Russia and closing its offices there. Unilever, maker of Marmite, Dove beauty products and PG Tips, among other brands, also said it had suspended trade with Russia and planned to halt its advertising and media spending and investment in the country. It said it would continue to supply ""everyday essential food and hygiene products"" that are made in Russia. L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics company, is also shutting its stores and concessions in Russia and suspending online sales. In response to the number of firms packing up, Russia has warned that it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has temporarily been suspended. Andrei Turchak, secretary of the ruling United Russia party's general council, said on Monday evening: ""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia"", during what he described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine. Some firms have also defended plans to continue operating in Russia,including Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, whose founder told Japan's Nikkei newspaper that ""clothing is a necessity of life"".

"The conflict in Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil and gas, putting a further squeeze on the cost of living. World oil prices have jumped to $139 (Â£106) a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The Northern Ireland Consumer Council has found 500 litres of home heating oil costs Â£559.50 - an increase of 75% since 23 February. And petrol and diesel prices continue to soar. Petrol prices of Â£1.65 per litre have been reported in parts of Northern Ireland, with diesel prices close to Â£1.80 per litre some places. Those compare to around the Â£1.20 per litre mark a year ago, and prices are unlikely to fall any time soon. Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar NI oil prices up since Russia invaded Ukraine The owner of a County Fermanagh fuel company is predicting that diesel prices could hit Â£2 per litre by the end of this week. Garry Jennings, from Jennings Fuels and Lubricants in Kesh, said as well as volatility in oil market, there are issues with supplies coming into Northern Ireland. ""We are selling the fuel we've bought in on Friday, tonight it looks like there's going to be another 10p on oil and that's going to come to us tomorrow morning. ""We buy on the day and try and sell on the day so this is fuel we bought in on Friday, tomorrow's fuel is going to be 10p up, what's going to happen Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?"" The Northern Ireland Oil Federation (NIOF) have said there is no issue with supplies, but they are dealing with a 10-day backlog of orders due to mass panic-buying. While some drivers may be able to travel less or use public transport, that is not an option for transport companies. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel prices are felt directly by taxi drivers as they are self employed and account for all of their income and costs individually. Stephen Anton, from taxi company Fonacab, said rising fuel costs may encourage drivers to leave the industry ""In other words, they fuel their vehicles, the cost of doing so an expense against their booking income,"" Mr Anton said. ""While drivers can offset fuel costs against their taxable income, the increased fuel costs affect what they take home on a day-to-day basis."" He added: ""If this continues to be a problem, it has the potential to impact negatively on taxi driver numbers across Northern Ireland. ""Many drivers left the industry for various reasons during Covid and a substantial number have not returned, instead taking early retirement or remaining in other jobs they secured during lockdowns. ""A sustained high fuel cost may encourage some other drivers to do the same."" Mr Anton said the company was conscious that customers are feeling cost of living increases in their pockets too and did not want to increase fares unnecessarily. ""There is a balancing act to ensuring that prices remain competitive and affordable for our customers and are also sufficient to allow drivers to make a living and work to provide the services that customers need,"" he said. ""The current fuel price increases make this a more difficult exercise than ever. ""From our perspective, anything that can be done to reduce fuel costs for drivers' vehicles is a priority. ""A temporary decrease in fuel duty would be welcome, and there are other tools that local government can employ to reduce overall costs for drivers - for example, reducing the cost of an annual PSV for a taxi to that of an MoT."" Paul Stewart said some form of price cap would be beneficial Paul Stewart, from courier firm NI Parcels, said fuel prices had been increasing ""slowly but surely"" over the last year. ""However, in the last six weeks the increases have been huge,"" he said. ""It has been the largest increase I have ever seen in our business. ""We have been absorbing some of the increases ourselves, but there is only so much you can absorb, so this has now resulted in some of the increased costs onto our customers. ""As the fuel prices change so regularly, it is difficult to keep changing your prices and this could make our business look unprofessional. ""It is a very difficult time to absorb the costs or increase prices, we have done a blend of both for now."" Mr Stewart said the full costs have not been passed onto customers, meaning a reduction in profits for the company. ""The main issue is the constant price changes making it difficult to set prices, some form of price freeze or price caps would be hugely appreciated,"" he said. ""As the fuel price increases so does the revenue collected on the duty on the increased prices. Duty on fuel could be reduced to help with these increases.""

"Scotty David A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial has told a hearing it was an ""inadvertent mistake"", not a lie, to fail to disclose on a questionnaire that he was an abuse victim himself. Maxwell was convicted of trafficking girls and her lawyers want a new trial, arguing the jury were not impartial. Her case was thrown into disarray when this juror told the media he had told other jurors about his own abuse. The hearing in New York will establish whether or not Maxwell is retried. Maxwell, the daughter of a late British media tycoon, was convicted in December of grooming teenage girls for abuse by the late Jeffrey Epstein. She faces up to 65 years in prison but maintains her innocence. Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Key moments in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial Prince Andrew pays settlement in sex assault case The juror in question, who asked to be identified by his first and middle name, Scotty David, was given immunity from prosecution earlier on Tuesday. When asked why he failed to disclose his past in the jury questionnaire when explicitly asked, he said it was an ""inadvertent mistake."" ""This is one of the biggest mistakes I have made in my life,"" he added, saying he ""flew through"" the document and was ""super-distracted"" by everything going on around him in the jury room. After the conviction of Maxwell he had told reporters that he had shared his own experience of sexual abuse with jurors after some had questioned the recollections from two of Maxwell's accusers. This admission immediately prompted Maxwell's lawyers to demand a retrial.

"Shell has pledged to stop buying oil from Russia as it apologised for its purchase of cheap Russian crude at the weekend. The energy giant also said it would close all its service stations in the country and stop all current work there. Shell came under huge criticism at the weekend after it purchased a cargo of Russian crude at a discounted price. Its boss said on Tuesday, however, that it was wrong to buy Russian oil. ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Mr van Beurden said. The company said it will immediately stop purchasing Russian crude oil and will shut about 500 service stations there, as well as halting its aviation fuel and lubricant operations in the country. The rest of the company's exit from Russian oil and gas is expected to take some time. The Ukrainian foreign minister had hit out at the firm on social media after it emerged Shell had bought crude.

""Doesn't Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you,"" asked Dmytro Kuleba. Exiting the Russia market is ""a complex challenge,"" admitted Mr van Beurden. ""Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer."" When Shell was forced to defend its purchase of Russian crudeover the weekend, it insisted that it had ""no alternative"" in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. Russian oil currently makes up about 8% of Shell's working supplies. One of the firm's refineries, which produces diesel and petrol and other products, is also among the biggest in Europe. Cargoes from other sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply, it said. Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft It still remains unclear, however, how exactly Shell will replace the volume of energy produced by Russia. ""These societal challenges highlight the dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies across Europe,"" said Mr van Beurden. ""But ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made during the war in Ukraine."" He added that the firm would continue to work with governments on how to manage any potential impact on energy supplies. Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden apologised for buying discounted Russian crude oil. And any profits it generates from remaining Russian oil will go to dedicated funds aimed at helping people affected by the war in Ukraine. The move follows previous announcements by the company, which set out its plans to end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom following the invasion. That will involve the company selling its 27.5% stake in a major liquefied natural gas plant and a 50% stake in two oilfield projects in Siberia. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. The 1,200km pipeline under the Baltic Seahad already been put on hold by German ministers. Shell said that it expected the move would cost about $3bn (Â£2.2bn) and followed on from BP announcing it would offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft, which it has held since 2013. BP's stake in Rosneft is valued at around $25bn. Extracting a company like Shell from the Russian energy market is a complex business. Unlike BP, which owns a 19.75% financial stake in Rosneft which it intends to walk away from, Shell has complex operations with thousands of employees on the ground. Extricating itself from long-term supply contracts will take months. Buying a cargo of Russian crude at knock-down prices as other companies shunned Russian supplies drew outrage on social media and, according to Shell sources, dismay from its own employees in Ukraine. The company insists it had to buy the cargo to avoid disruptions to operations at its huge refinery in Pernis, Rotterdam, and was not ""trying to make a quick buck"". But that explanation drew scepticism in some quarters and the chief executive apologised today, saying it had been the wrong thing to do.  The company also said that phasing out Russian oil and gas would need to be done carefully to minimise the damage done to the rest of the world. A reminder that the tougher the sanction, the greater the collateral damage on those imposing them. Shell's plans emerged asa warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin warnedthat it would close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted, as Shell has pointed out. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.

"Consumer giants including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have joined the list of firms halting business in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut. On Wednesday, Heineken stopped beer production and sales in Russia. And Mothercare said all business in Russia, which represents 20% to 25% of its global sales, had been stopped. Elsewhere, tobacco company Imperial Brands - the group behind brands including JPS and Davidoff cigarettes - said it was pausing production at its factory in Volgograd in a move impacting about 1,000 employees. It has already suspended its operations in Ukraine over staff safety concerns. Russia and Ukraine together accounted for 2% of Imperial's net revenues last year - about Â£656m. Meanwhile, British American Tobacco has halted investment in Russia, but said its business in the country continues to operate. The moves by McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks come after mounting pressure on companies to act over the war in Ukraine. All three firms said they would continue to pay their staff. Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors, told the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme that firms who were joining the wave of firms leaving Russia were doing so because ""shareholders and wider stakeholders wouldn't stand for continued generation of revenues and profits"" from the country, ""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she said.

McDonald's established a presence in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was opening its economy, and it drew thousands for its burgers and fries. Its closure now carries similar symbolic weight, and could influence other firms. However, fast-food chain rival Burger King is currently keeping its Russian stores open. It committed $3m (Â£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people fleeing to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers. Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. The company told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change currently. McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski said it was ""impossible to predict"" when it would reopen in Russia. McDonalds has also temporarily closed its 108 restaurants in Ukraine. Collectively the countries account for about 9% of the firm's revenue and about 2% of global sales. Companies have been under pressure to act as Russian violence against civilians has escalated. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaColahad both been trending on Twitter over recent days. Dozens of well-known firms includingNetflix and Levi's have already suspended salesor stopped providing services in Russia amid severe sanctions imposed by Western allies. Coca-Cola on Tuesday said it was suspending operations in Russia, which accounted for roughly 2% of the firm's operating revenue and income. It also has a roughly 20% ownership stake in a bottling and distribution business in Russia. ""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" the company said. Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia and suspending capital investments and advertising, citing ""horrific events"" in Ukraine. But the company, which started operating in Russia during the Cold War and now employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products. ""As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,"" boss Ramon Laguarta said. ""That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food."" Starbucks' plans to stop business in Russia include stopping shipments of its products. The coffee chain's licensee in the country Kuwait-based Alshaya Group will continue to pay its roughly 2,000 staff members. Other major global brands joining the backlash on Tuesday included the world's largest music company, Universal Music Group, which said it was suspending all operations in Russia and closing its offices there. Unilever, maker of Marmite, Dove beauty products and PG Tips, among other brands, also said it had suspended trade with Russia and planned to halt its advertising and media spending and investment in the country. It said it would continue to supply ""everyday essential food and hygiene products"" that are made in Russia. L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics company, is also shutting its stores and concessions in Russia and suspending online sales. In response to the number of firms packing up, Russia has warned that it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has temporarily been suspended. Andrei Turchak, secretary of the ruling United Russia party's general council, said on Monday evening: ""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia"", during what he described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine. Some firms have also defended plans to continue operating in Russia,including Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, whose founder told Japan's Nikkei newspaper that ""clothing is a necessity of life"".

"Members of a Ukrainian family wait for paperwork to be completed at the ferry terminal in Calais, France Almost 300 Ukrainian refugees trying to reach the UK have already been turned back at the French border by British Border Force officials, the Calais authorities have said. Hundreds more are trying to complete paperwork for the visa that will allow them to cross the Channel by tunnel or ferry. On Monday, one family followed by the BBC was sent from building to building across Calais to track down promised British support. When they eventually found the right place, the Home Office representation amounted to three men at a trestle table in a deserted departure hall at the port, with bags of ready salted crisps and Kit Kats. The family were advised to make an appointment for 15 March, about 200 miles away in Paris. The British staff offering water and snacks at a deserted Calais port building Having promised a Home Office ""surge team"" would be available in Calais to support people fleeing the war and looking to come to Britain, the government now says there is no visa application centre (VAC) in the city and refugees should go elsewhere. The Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she has decided not to set up a VAC in Calais because refugees might be exploited by the criminal gangs of people traffickers.  The government is worried about a ""pull factor,"" encouraging desperate people to risk their lives by attempting to cross the channel in small boats. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground SYMBOL:Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war sign? VIRAL:False claims that war is a hoax EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict The Home Office now says it has set up a VAC centre in Lille, around 70 miles from Calais. In Calais yesterday, a Home Office presence at a local administrative building disappeared, a sign at the hostel instead advising people to go to Brussels where there are now walk-in appointments, or try to get an appointment in Paris. The UK has retained controls on the entry of refugees from Ukraine Calais regional administrator Veronique Deprez-Boudier told us it was important that the UK build a more organised team to help people in Calais. ""Ideally they would get their visas here, and not have to take the train to get a visa,"" she said. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people from Ukraine,"" a Home Office spokesperson told the BBC.  ""We have worked closely with Ukrainian partners to ensure our measures respond directly to their needs and asks and the government's Ukraine Family Scheme will help tens of thousands of people to join their family members in the UK."" Unlike the European Union - which is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa - the UK has retained controls on entry, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was ""sensible"" to ""have some basic ability to check who is coming in and who isn't"". There are two main routes to a visa for refugees, requiring them either to have family in the UK, or a British sponsor for their application. The experience of Misha, his wife and children, is typical.  A British citizen with a home in north-east London, he drove 2,000 miles to Poland to rescue his Ukrainian wife Maria and two children, 17-year-old Gabrielle and six-year-old Misha Jr. They had walked 45 miles to escape the war and reach the border. He drove them to Calais where they have been now for six days, having been turned back by Border Force officers at the ferry terminal because they did not all have visas. Misha, a scaffolder by trade, is now close to despair, his daughter in tears, as they try to navigate the bureaucracy. Maria has a vacant look in her eyes that speaks of a nightmare journey still without a final conclusion. ""I feel left out,"" Misha told the BBC. ""Who else is going to help me if not my own government?"" Misha, a scaffolder from north-west London, drove 2,000 miles to pick up his family - at Calais he was redirected to Paris We followed Misha, who was among other desperate refugees - including many children, babies and elderly people, as he returned from a fruitless trek to the building, unsure what to do or where to go. What ""shoulder to shoulder"" actually meant. Eventually, Misha spoke to a Border Force official who advised him to head across town to a port building - where he was met with the chocolate and crisps. ""Another week stuck here,"" he lamented. ""I have never claimed a benefit in my life and the first time I ask my government for their help, this is how they treat me. I am gutted."" For the hundreds of refugees in Calais, there appears to be a gap as wide as the English Channel between the supportive rhetoric of ministers in London and the reality on the ground.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

"War in Ukraine will push up energy prices and see UK families squeezed even further, a think tank has warned. The Resolution Foundation forecasts that a typical household's income will fall by about Â£1,000 this year once the effect of inflation is accounted for. That would be the biggest real-terms fall in incomes since the mid-1970s, it added. A government spokesperson said it recognised the pressures households are facing. Many families were already expecting their monthly spend to go up when the energy price cap jumps in April, and National Insurance contributions rise. Butin a new report,external, the Resolution Foundation said the Ukraine conflict would push up living costs even further as the prices of fuel and other goods surged. It expects inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to peak in April at 8.3%. That is much higher the Bank of England'sforecast of 7.25% back in February. Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar ""The crisis in Ukraine has increased both the scale of price rises but also the degree of uncertainty about their levels and duration,"" the Foundation's report said. ""The UK's post-Covid economic recovery is well under way, but a deep living standards downturn is just getting going,"" it added, also warning that wages are not forecast to grow particularly fast either. This spring was always going to be a crunch moment. At the start of April, spikes in global oil and gas prices from last year start to feed through to our energy bills and the energy price cap jumps up. You should have had a message from your provider by now explaining what's happening to your particular bill and warning about an increase to your direct debit. That will be hard enough for many households, but we're also now seeing record prices at petrol stations due to the war in Ukraine. The Resolution Foundation is also warning the conflict will bring more price rises, with inflation peaking at the same point as the price cap goes up. The only saving grace is the time of year. At least if the weather improves (and that's a big ""if""), we can start using less energy and leaving the car at home becomes easier for many. That could help people to divert cash to cover the rising prices in shops, which we will have to pay whatever the season. Its principal economist, Adam Cortlett, said soaring bills would hit low and middle-income families the hardest. He also suggested poorer households would face a ""living standards rollercoaster"" because of the way that benefit payments are set months in advance. For example, most working age benefits and the state pension are due to rise by 3.1% in April - a time when the increase in the cost of living could be as high as 8%. But high inflation in 2022 should lead to bigger payments next year. The think tank called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce fresh support for struggling families at his Spring Statement. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While the economic fallout from the war will feel trivial compared to the suffering experienced by millions of Ukrainians, it will still have a significant impact in Britain."" He suggested that surging gas and oil prices would worsen the ""cost of living crisis"", causing a ""painful squeeze on family incomes"". Mr Bell told the BBC's Today programme the country was heading into a ""living standards recession"". ""We could see income falls of 4% in the financial year that's about to kick off, we never see that outside of significant recessions,"" he said. ""Given it will take us quite a few years to claw our way back from that, it may well feel like our living standards during the pandemic were as good as it got during the first half of the 2020s."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth around Â£20bn this financial year and next to help."" They said this includes freezing fuel duties to keep costs down, as well as launching energy bills rebate programme. ""We have also boosted the minimum wage by more than Â£1,000 a year for full-time workers and our Â£500m Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Women discuss their experiences of public sexual harassment Women have been speaking about shocking incidents of sexual harassment - after a BBC poll found many often still feel unsafe walking alone at night. The new poll suggests 43% of women in the UK have experienced unwelcome touching or groping in public. The survey -conducted by YouGov,external- also indicates 28% of women have experienced indecent exposure in public. The chair of the Women and Equalities Committee said Boris Johnson must show he takes women's safety seriously. It follows growing pressure to make public sexual harassment a crime. Caroline Nokes, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told the BBC changing the law would send a ""really powerful message"" and could help tackle underlying causes of violent offences against women. ""It will give women the confidence to report and sends a very clear message to perpetrators that this is criminal,"" she said. How many violent attacks on women are there? Sarah Everard: The people trying to make change The survey found two thirds - 66% - of women said they did not feel safe walking alone at night, at least some of the time. That compared to just 39% of men who said they felt unsafe in the same situation. The findings come a year after the murder of Sarah Everard, who was abducted and murdered while walking home in south London. Ms Everard's killer, police officer Wayne Couzens, was previously linked to allegations of indecent public exposure. Hers and other high-profile cases in the past year have led to increased awareness and campaigning around women's safety and public sexual harassment. The BBC has also spoken to women across the UK about how sexual harassment impacts their lives. One, a woman named Sarah, was on her way to a morning exercise class in Edinburgh last year when a man followed and groped her before running off laughing and filming her reaction. ""I was incredibly shocked. I remember I felt incredibly angry as well,"" she told the BBC. ""I also felt a real invasion of privacy, the fact he had filmed the whole incident."" What happened to Sarah that day was the worst of a long history of experiences she and her friends remember going through over the years - from being groped in nightclubs as students to being shouted at by strangers in the street. ""We used to be catcalled all the time as teenagers going out. It was something we laughed off and shrugged off,"" she said. ""But as a woman now, everyone has become a lot more aware of how dangerous those things are and how hostile it is."" ""There's an absolute entitlement to touch and to talk to you in a manner that is completely inappropriate,"" she added. Sarah said the ""brazen"" assault by a stranger left her with a ""horrible feeling"" More than half of the women surveyed for the BBC said they avoided certain areas and being out at certain times to try to keep themselves safe from possible harassment and assault. Roxanne, 26, no longer feels confident walking alone after experiencing everything from obscene comments to unwanted touching when out in public since she was a teenager. Roxanne believes a door has opened for women to ""normalise"" speaking out about their experiences She now sticks to main roads when walking her dog and tries to only go out in daylight when she's by herself. Like 30% of women surveyed in the poll for the BBC, Roxanne says she wears flat shoes as a way to feel safer. She also carries a rape alarm, criminal identification spray and tries not to wear her hair in hairstyles such as ponytails she fears might be easier for an attacker to grab. ""I don't know who's going to harm me, when they're going to harm me - so I'm cautious of everybody,"" she said. ""And I think that's a natural and very common thing to feel with everything that's going on."" The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated 2.2% of the population aged between 16-59 were victims of sexual assault in the year ending March 2020 - a slight decrease on the year before. Public sexual harassment is not currently an offence in its own right. The term refers to unwanted sexual behaviour - from verbal comments to physical actions - which can leave victims feeling intimidated and degraded. The Law Commission - an independent body that advises the government on legal changes - recommended in December that ministers should consider creating a specific criminal offence for it during a review into hate crime laws. Ms Nokes believes criminalising public sexual harassment could help intervene in escalating offender journeys to ensure ""today's flasher does not become tomorrow's rapist"". ""I think the prime minister needs to step up and show that he does take women's safety seriously and that he's not interested in a few cosmetic measures like CCTV - but actually in legislative change with a cross-government approach,"" she said. Caroline Nokes told the BBC the government should do more to help women feel safe She believes current safety initiatives and advice place too much onus on women having to take precautions to try to protect themselves. ""Of course we want women to be safe and we want them to be vigilant, but this is about men attacking them when they are just going about their daily lives,"" she said. ""Women should be safe wherever they are, whatever they're doing, however they're dressed."" Ms Nokes also supports cultural and education reforms - including with mandatory consent classes in schools, colleges and universities. Nathaniel Horne works for a charity that runs workshops for boys and men aimed at tackling misogyny and encouraging healthier relationships. Nathaniel Horne says ""all men can be better"" to help women feel more safe and change attitudes in society ""It's important to talk to people about this stuff early,"" he told the BBC about going into schools. ""Because I think once people are adults, and they've been out for a while, that can be entrenched in those views and those behaviours."" The view is echoed by April-Joy Serrant, who last year was exposed to by a man performing a sex act in public while out on a run. As a mother of three sons, she says her experience has changed how she speaks with her children about relationships and content they may be exposed to. After posting a video about her experience online, she was overwhelmed by other women and girls getting in touch with their own experiences of the ""day in, day out"" harassment. ""It had never crossed my mind until the incident that I experienced last year that my husband can go for a walk or for a run and it never crosses his mind,"" she said. ""And that is freedom."" The Home Office told the BBC that tacking violence against women and girls ""remains one of the top priorities of this government"". ""We are committed to ensuring that existing laws on public sexual harassment are effective but we continue to look carefully at where there may be gaps and how a specific offence could address those,"" safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean said in a statement."" She said the government last week launched a new national communications campaign and said violence against women had now been made a priority for police forces, alongside national threats like terrorism.

"Shell has pledged to stop buying oil from Russia as it apologised for its purchase of cheap Russian crude at the weekend. The energy giant also said it would close all its service stations in the country and stop all current work there. Shell came under huge criticism at the weekend after it purchased a cargo of Russian crude at a discounted price. Its boss said on Tuesday, however, that it was wrong to buy Russian oil. ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Mr van Beurden said. The company said it will immediately stop purchasing Russian crude oil and will shut about 500 service stations there, as well as halting its aviation fuel and lubricant operations in the country. The rest of the company's exit from Russian oil and gas is expected to take some time. The Ukrainian foreign minister had hit out at the firm on social media after it emerged Shell had bought crude.

""Doesn't Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you,"" asked Dmytro Kuleba. Exiting the Russia market is ""a complex challenge,"" admitted Mr van Beurden. ""Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer."" When Shell was forced to defend its purchase of Russian crudeover the weekend, it insisted that it had ""no alternative"" in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. Russian oil currently makes up about 8% of Shell's working supplies. One of the firm's refineries, which produces diesel and petrol and other products, is also among the biggest in Europe. Cargoes from other sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply, it said. Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft It still remains unclear, however, how exactly Shell will replace the volume of energy produced by Russia. ""These societal challenges highlight the dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies across Europe,"" said Mr van Beurden. ""But ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made during the war in Ukraine."" He added that the firm would continue to work with governments on how to manage any potential impact on energy supplies. Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden apologised for buying discounted Russian crude oil. And any profits it generates from remaining Russian oil will go to dedicated funds aimed at helping people affected by the war in Ukraine. The move follows previous announcements by the company, which set out its plans to end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom following the invasion. That will involve the company selling its 27.5% stake in a major liquefied natural gas plant and a 50% stake in two oilfield projects in Siberia. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. The 1,200km pipeline under the Baltic Seahad already been put on hold by German ministers. Shell said that it expected the move would cost about $3bn (Â£2.2bn) and followed on from BP announcing it would offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft, which it has held since 2013. BP's stake in Rosneft is valued at around $25bn. Extracting a company like Shell from the Russian energy market is a complex business. Unlike BP, which owns a 19.75% financial stake in Rosneft which it intends to walk away from, Shell has complex operations with thousands of employees on the ground. Extricating itself from long-term supply contracts will take months. Buying a cargo of Russian crude at knock-down prices as other companies shunned Russian supplies drew outrage on social media and, according to Shell sources, dismay from its own employees in Ukraine. The company insists it had to buy the cargo to avoid disruptions to operations at its huge refinery in Pernis, Rotterdam, and was not ""trying to make a quick buck"". But that explanation drew scepticism in some quarters and the chief executive apologised today, saying it had been the wrong thing to do.  The company also said that phasing out Russian oil and gas would need to be done carefully to minimise the damage done to the rest of the world. A reminder that the tougher the sanction, the greater the collateral damage on those imposing them. Shell's plans emerged asa warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin warnedthat it would close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted, as Shell has pointed out. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.

At the start of April, spikes in global oil and gas prices from last year start to feed through to our energy bills and the energy price cap jumps up. You should have had a message from your provider by now explaining what's happening to your particular bill and warning about an increase to your direct debit. That will be hard enough for many households, but we're also now seeing record prices at petrol stations due to the war in Ukraine. The Resolution Foundation is also warning the conflict will bring more price rises, with inflation peaking at the same point as the price cap goes up. The only saving grace is the time of year. At least if the weather improves (and that's a big ""if""), we can start using less energy and leaving the car at home becomes easier for many. That could help people to divert cash to cover the rising prices in shops, which we will have to pay whatever the season. Its principal economist, Adam Cortlett, said soaring bills would hit low and middle-income families the hardest. He also suggested poorer households would face a ""living standards rollercoaster"" because of the way that benefit payments are set months in advance. For example, most working age benefits and the state pension are due to rise by 3.1% in April - a time when the increase in the cost of living could be as high as 8%. But high inflation in 2022 should lead to bigger payments next year. The think tank called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce fresh support for struggling families at his Spring Statement. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While the economic fallout from the war will feel trivial compared to the suffering experienced by millions of Ukrainians, it will still have a significant impact in Britain."" He suggested that surging gas and oil prices would worsen the ""cost of living crisis"", causing a ""painful squeeze on family incomes"". Mr Bell told the BBC's Today programme the country was heading into a ""living standards recession"". ""We could see income falls of 4% in the financial year that's about to kick off, we never see that outside of significant recessions,"" he said. ""Given it will take us quite a few years to claw our way back from that, it may well feel like our living standards during the pandemic were as good as it got during the first half of the 2020s."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth around Â£20bn this financial year and next to help."" They said this includes freezing fuel duties to keep costs down, as well as launching energy bills rebate programme. ""We have also boosted the minimum wage by more than Â£1,000 a year for full-time workers and our Â£500m Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs,"" they added.

"The owner of Uniqlo has defended its decision to keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a ""necessity of life"". Uniqlo has 49 stores in Russia and while it will ""monitor the situation"" it has no plans to suspend trading. A number of Western firms such as Zara and H&M, have halted operations in Russia because of the war with Ukraine. But Fast Retailing's founder Tadashi Yanai said Russia's people ""have the same right to live as we do"". Mr Yanai told Japan's Nikkei newspaper: ""There should never be war. Every country should oppose it,"" But he said: ""Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do."" Uniqlo is not alone in its decision to continue its operations in Russia, despite a number of firms exiting the country in reaction to its invasion of Ukraine. Many international firms that rely on production plants and customer bases in Russia have chosen to stay in the country. Though, food and drink giants McDonald's and Coca-Cola have announced plans to close operations in Russia after being criticised, Burger King and KFC restaurants remain open. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, said it had suspended all investment in Russia ""while we continue to assess additional options"". The company - which has about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia mostly run by franchisees - is not pulling out of the country, but says it will ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. It has also committed $3m (Â£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people feeling to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers. The world's largest yoghurt maker, French firm Danone, has said it will not commit new investment to Russia but will continue to sell dairy, water bottles and baby food in the country. ""It is very easy to get drawn into black-and-white thinking and demagogic positions, but in the end our reputation is about our behaviour,"" chief executive Antoine de Saint-Affriquetold the Financial Times.,external Danone dairy production at one of its biggest plants in the Russian town of Chekhov ""We have a responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk, and the tens of thousands of people who depend on us."" Danone has 8,000 workers across 10 sites in Russia. Tobacco giant Philip Morris International was the leading foreign company by revenue in Russia in 2020. It has suspended operations in Ukraine but not Russia. Japan Tobacco, which has a 37% share of the Russian market and 4,500 employees in the country, also continues to operate in Russia. Its tax payments in 2020 accounted for 1.4% of the Russian Federation state budget according to the company's website.Japan Tobacco says it is ""fully committed"" to complying with national and international sanctions. British American Tobacco (BAT) has 2,500 workers across 76 offices in Russia and continues to sell cigarettes in the country where it has operated for more than 30 years. ""BAT always complies with relevant regulation and legislation wherever we operate, and we are aligned with all international sanctions,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.  ""We continue to closely monitor the situation as it evolves."" Russia is carmaker Renault's second-biggest market and accounts for around 12% of Renault's revenue, about $5.5bn (Â£4.2bn). The French government currently has a 15% stake in Renault and is its most important investor in terms of voting rights. The French company has not made any statements on the issue and has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of Russia, and has stopped all new investment, media and advertising in the country. However, the firm said it will continue to supply its ""everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia"" to people in the country. Operations at the firm's sites in Moscow, Omsk, Saint-Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Tula remain open. Unilever - whose brands include Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Domestos and Dove - employs 3,000 people in Russia. Nestle, which made $1.7bn from Russian sales in 2020, has six factories in Russia making snacks and drinks. The firm says it has ""business continuity plans in place that can be activated as needed"". ""The safety and protection of our employees remains our highest priority. We will not speculate on any potential sanctions. Responding to Ukrainian deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov's letter and tweet calling on the company to leave Russia, Japanese conglomerate Hitachi said it ""continues to monitor the situation closely"". It said it had paused ""operational activity in the affected areas"". It did not specify whether these areas related to production in Russia or its plants in Ukraine.

"The funeral in Moscow last week for a Russian sergeant killed in Ukraine President Putin has directly addressed the mothers of soldiers serving in Ukraine, telling them: ""I know how worried you are"" and trying to reassure them. But some mothers, grandmothers, sisters and girlfriends have been telling the BBC they are desperately anxious about loved ones in the military - young men who appear to have had little idea what they were being sent to do. All names have been changed When Marina hadn't heard from her grandson for more than a week, she started making calls. In his final message to her, he said he was on the Belarus-Ukraine border and would be home soon. But with no news since, she fears the worst. ""I phoned his military unit, they said he hadn't left [Russia]. 'I said - are you joking? He contacted me from Belarus. Do you not know where your soldiers go?' They hung up and didn't talk to me any more."" Marina's grandson Nikita was originally a conscript. Men in Russia aged 18-27 who do not have an exemption - such as studying or looking after young children - are drafted into the military for a year. But Marina says in Nikita's first few days of service, representatives of military units arrived in their region, hoping to get conscripts to become contracted soldiers in order to lengthen their military service and earn a salary. Contractors make up the bulk of Russia's junior service personnel. They ""convinced him""... ""[They told him] you can retire early, you will have a steady salary, you will learn how to drive."" Nikita became a driver in a mechanised infantry division, but his earnings did not translate into a comfortable standard of living. His monthly salary of 18,000 roubles - $240 (Â£180) before the rouble crashed - was just enough to get by on in rural Russia. And, he told his grandmother, he was expected to pay for uniform and petrol out of that salary. He had free accommodation in barracks but could not bear the freezing conditions - there was no heating or hot water - so had to pay for rent as well, she says. It is difficult to establish how common Nikita's experience is, but the scores of Russian companies who help young men find loopholes to avoid the draft suggest the army is not seen as an attractive prospect. In mid-February, Nikita told his grandmother he was moving to the Ukraine-Belarus border ""to guard it"". He also told her he had heard they would soon be returning home. There has been no word from him since he last texted her on 23 February - a Russian public holiday - to say he was at a concert. She is certain her grandson had no idea he would be sent into combat in Ukraine. ""He said, 'It's drills and more drills and then we go home',"" a line repeated by many Russian soldiers' relatives we spoke to. Military drills in Belarus just before the Russian invasion of Ukraine - many families thought that was all their son or partner was going to be doing Another woman, Galina, says she only realised her son Nikolai was in Ukraine when her sister spotted his photo on the Facebook page of Ukraine's armed forces' chief as a POW. A US Pentagon briefing on Friday suggested that a significant number of the men fighting in Ukraine are conscripts, and that might account for their inexperience and lack of awareness about what they were expected to do. But it appears the men's belief - that they were simply on drills rather than being sent into combat - was not unique to conscripts. Like Marina's grandson Nikita - and many of the other men whose relatives we spoke to - Galina's son Nikolai began as a conscript, but was now a contracted soldier. Galina says she last heard from Nikolai the day before her sister spotted his photo, when he told her his unit was near the Ukrainian border. ""I don't know what to do. The media is silent about the fact that our guys were captured. Or they don't know."" Nikolai's girlfriend says he became a contract soldier last December to ""provide for his future family"", despite her efforts to dissuade him. His mother adds that there are no other opportunities to earn decent money locally. ""My child did not go [to Ukraine] of his own free will, the commander-in-chief sent him there,"" she says. ""To be honest, I don't understand what it's all for,"" she says. ""In our country, some people have nothing to eat. I don't understand any war or any military action. ""Whose door should I knock on to get my child back?"" This sense of impotence is shared by another mother the BBC spoke to, whose son also worked as a contract soldier and was sent away on ""drills"". ""If I knew where he is now, I would have packed up myself and gone to these people and begged them for mercy,"" she says. Historically, soldiers' mothers in Russia have been outspoken about how the military has been deployed and treated, and have agitated for the authorities to be more open about casualty figures. They played a particularly significant role in agitating against both of Russia's Chechen wars, waging awidely publicised campaign,external. Mothers of soldiers deployed in Chechnya waged a powerful campaign to bring their sons home But a new law passed in the country last week threatens anyone seen to be spreading what the government deems ""fakes"" about military action in Ukraine with 15 years in jail. The Russian public has also been exposed to powerful anti-Ukrainepropaganda from Russian state-run media. The sister of one man she believes is missing in Ukraine said she thought there must be a good reason for the invasion. ""And now we are called to rallies. To me it looks like they [Ukraine] have destroyed their [own] country, and now they want to destroy another."" Ukraine has sought to counter that propaganda with a powerful campaign of its own. A helpline called ""Look for your own"" (Ishchi Svoikh in Russian) was first advertised on day three of what Russia was describing as a ""special military operation to demilitarise and denazify"" the country. A companion Telegram channel carries photos of Russian POWs and casualties, and encourages worried relatives to get in touch. The Washington Post hashighlighted concerns,externalabout the publication of the graphic images. ""This is our gesture of good will to the Russian mothers,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych announced. A flyer carried on the Ukrainian interior ministry Facebook page goes even further, making a direct call to Russian mothers to come and collect their sons, and gives specific instructions about what to do. ""We, Ukrainian people, in contrast to [Russian President] Putin's fascists, do not make war with mothers and their captured sons,"" it says. Despite these appeals, all the relatives we spoke to had no view on the legitimacy of Russia's action in Ukraine or supported it. But the text exchange of one woman with her soldier fiance - which she showed to the BBC - suggested that in his case he did not buy into the Russian rhetoric that they were entering Ukraine to ""liberate"" the population. In it, he tells his fiancee that he is off on ""a tour around some countries"" - possibly referring to Russia's ally and neighbour Belarus - before saying he is going to ""defend the defenceless, LOL"". When she asks ""Are you joking?"" he simply replies: ""No. I am going to war."" Russia finally published death toll figures for its combatants in the invasion last week, saying that as of 3 March 498 Russian troops had been killed and a further 1,597 injured. But Ukraine says that more than 11,000 Russian military have been killed, though this cannot be verified. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was ""less freely"" traded compared to oil, and it would be ""much more difficult"" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports. In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be ""impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market"". ""It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,"" he said. Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation. ""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" he said. Could the world survive without Russian oil? Could EU weaponise energy in Russia crisis? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, ""practically it is challenging"". He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine ""with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes"". ""The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,"" he told the BBC. ""The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow."" Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a ""completely different kettle of fish"". He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with ""vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off"" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil. EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution. The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted. Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight. And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war. Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat. Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (Â£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon. UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban. Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended. Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Average UK petrol prices have hit a record 155p a litre Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies. Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe. ""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Watch: US bans all Russian oil and gas imports The US and UK are banning Russian oil and the EU is ending its reliance on Russian gas, stepping up the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine. US President Joe Biden said the move targeted ""the main artery of Russia's economy"". Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers. Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US. Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of ""catastrophic"" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany. On the ground in Ukraine,civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areaswhile the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict. The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher. However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil. Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day. ""I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,"" he said. President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. ""We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,"" he said. ""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin."" Mr Biden admitted the move was ""not without cost at home,"" adding the decision was taken ""in close consultation"" with allies. In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added ""what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme"". About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports. By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels ""well before 2030"". This video can not be played Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine ""We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,"" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. ""But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security."" Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany. But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'.

"The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was an early casualty of Germany's change of heart over Russia You know that feeling when you're running downhill, going so fast that you seem to lose control of your own feet? That's where the EU appears to be at the moment. Crushing financial sanctions on Russia that hurt European business. Brussels purchasing and sending weapons to a non-EU country at war. Germany beefing up its military, despite post-World War Two queasiness. Staunchly neutral Finland and Sweden thinking of joining Nato. The bloc's asylum procedure pushed aside to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians, in what's described as Europe's biggest refugee crisis since 1945. Once dismissed as impossible - or at least, hugely improbable - from one day to the next, EU revolutions, provoked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, have been happening thick and fast. The next seismic change bubbling in Brussels? A looming energy revolution, provoked by a simple question: What's the point of punitive financial sanctions if Vladimir Putin's war chest is refilled on a daily basis with oil and gas revenues? The EU depends on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil imports. EU countries pay about â¬1bn a day to Moscow for those supplies, according to Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank. The US - which is far less reliant on Russian energy supplies than Europe - says it's considering banning Russian oil imports as part of its sanctions against the Kremlin. On Monday, standing next to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Lithuania's foreign minister agreed. ""We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood,"" he said. Along with other eastern European Nato and EU members, Lithuania views Vladimir Putin - with his ambitions to change Europe's geopolitical order in Moscow's favour - as an active security threat. The West must fight Russia ""with all means available"", said Lithuania's president. ""To avoid World War Three."" But other EU countries, such as big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports. Energy prices are already painfully high across the continent. Until Russia's attacks on Ukraine, the majority of Germans supported Nord Stream 2, their new gas pipeline direct from Russia. The pipeline has been frozen as part of EU sanctions against Russia, but Berlin fears public opinion could turn if Germans suddenly can't fill their cars with petrol or afford to heat their homes. Germany's Federation of Industries, the BDI, has warned that soaring prices could crush the EU's largest economy, forcing factory and other German business closures, with a rippling effect across the single market. Anti-nuclear sentiment has always been strong in Germany France's Emmanuel Macron is nervous too. He hopes to be re-elected president next month. The last time he was blamed for petrol price hikes in France, it sparked months of massive street protests by the ""gilets jaunes"", the yellow jackets, so-called because of the high-visibility vests they wore. So, while on the world stage, President Macron presents himself as the European champion of carbon neutrality, energy prices are such a sensitive issue in France that he introduced â¬100 bonuses for the poorest voters this winter, to mitigate fossil fuel prices as part of his re-election bid. It's notable, too, that French energy giant Total says it's staying put in Russia for now, despite the Kremlin's onslaught against Ukraine, while competitors BP and Shell have voluntarily pulled out. So are energy sanctions against Russia just the latest example of an ""EU impossible"" that will suddenly become reality? The issue will be discussed in the European Parliament on Tuesday and among EU leaders at their Thursday summit. When I speak to EU naysayers, they talk defensively, not only about the dangers of domestic blowback, but also potential aftershocks in the global energy market. ""At the moment, we're speaking with one voice alongside Latin America, regarding Russian aggression,"" one diplomat told me. ""But what would happen if the Argentine economy implodes as a result of energy price hikes and scarcity and the EU and the West is blamed for that?"" So for the moment, the EU is clinging to what it views as safer ground. On Monday, EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would be speeding up efforts to wean itself off Russian energy. These include: finding ""reliable"" alternative suppliers (such as Qatar and Azerbaijan) improving energy efficiency, eg renovating buildings and using artificial intelligence to effectively manage the energy grid ""massive investment"" in renewables such as solar, wind and hydrogen, already planned under the European Green Deal. Russia's actions in Ukraine mean Brussels now views the Climate Question as a question of security. Energy security. Germany's new chancellor took the world's breath away a week ago by reversing his country's defence policy, sending weapons to Ukraine and announcing a â¬100bn investment in the German military. His finance minister has also announced a â¬200bn investment in renewable and alternative energy sources. Germany's need is acute, as it has all but phased out nuclear energy, as well as phasing out coal. But those plans for renewable energies, alternative suppliers and a clean energy divorce from Russia will take time. Something Ukraine just does not have.

"Members of a Ukrainian family wait for paperwork to be completed at the ferry terminal in Calais, France Almost 300 Ukrainian refugees trying to reach the UK have already been turned back at the French border by British Border Force officials, the Calais authorities have said. Hundreds more are trying to complete paperwork for the visa that will allow them to cross the Channel by tunnel or ferry. On Monday, one family followed by the BBC was sent from building to building across Calais to track down promised British support. When they eventually found the right place, the Home Office representation amounted to three men at a trestle table in a deserted departure hall at the port, with bags of ready salted crisps and Kit Kats. The family were advised to make an appointment for 15 March, about 200 miles away in Paris. The British staff offering water and snacks at a deserted Calais port building Having promised a Home Office ""surge team"" would be available in Calais to support people fleeing the war and looking to come to Britain, the government now says there is no visa application centre (VAC) in the city and refugees should go elsewhere. The Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she has decided not to set up a VAC in Calais because refugees might be exploited by the criminal gangs of people traffickers.  The government is worried about a ""pull factor,"" encouraging desperate people to risk their lives by attempting to cross the channel in small boats. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground SYMBOL:Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war sign? VIRAL:False claims that war is a hoax EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict The Home Office now says it has set up a VAC centre in Lille, around 70 miles from Calais. In Calais yesterday, a Home Office presence at a local administrative building disappeared, a sign at the hostel instead advising people to go to Brussels where there are now walk-in appointments, or try to get an appointment in Paris. The UK has retained controls on the entry of refugees from Ukraine Calais regional administrator Veronique Deprez-Boudier told us it was important that the UK build a more organised team to help people in Calais. ""Ideally they would get their visas here, and not have to take the train to get a visa,"" she said. ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people from Ukraine,"" a Home Office spokesperson told the BBC.  ""We have worked closely with Ukrainian partners to ensure our measures respond directly to their needs and asks and the government's Ukraine Family Scheme will help tens of thousands of people to join their family members in the UK."" Unlike the European Union - which is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa - the UK has retained controls on entry, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was ""sensible"" to ""have some basic ability to check who is coming in and who isn't"". There are two main routes to a visa for refugees, requiring them either to have family in the UK, or a British sponsor for their application. The experience of Misha, his wife and children, is typical.  A British citizen with a home in north-east London, he drove 2,000 miles to Poland to rescue his Ukrainian wife Maria and two children, 17-year-old Gabrielle and six-year-old Misha Jr. They had walked 45 miles to escape the war and reach the border. He drove them to Calais where they have been now for six days, having been turned back by Border Force officers at the ferry terminal because they did not all have visas. Misha, a scaffolder by trade, is now close to despair, his daughter in tears, as they try to navigate the bureaucracy. Maria has a vacant look in her eyes that speaks of a nightmare journey still without a final conclusion. ""I feel left out,"" Misha told the BBC. ""Who else is going to help me if not my own government?"" Misha, a scaffolder from north-west London, drove 2,000 miles to pick up his family - at Calais he was redirected to Paris We followed Misha, who was among other desperate refugees - including many children, babies and elderly people, as he returned from a fruitless trek to the building, unsure what to do or where to go. What ""shoulder to shoulder"" actually meant. Eventually, Misha spoke to a Border Force official who advised him to head across town to a port building - where he was met with the chocolate and crisps. ""Another week stuck here,"" he lamented. ""I have never claimed a benefit in my life and the first time I ask my government for their help, this is how they treat me. I am gutted."" For the hundreds of refugees in Calais, there appears to be a gap as wide as the English Channel between the supportive rhetoric of ministers in London and the reality on the ground.

"The owner of Uniqlo has defended its decision to keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a ""necessity of life"". Uniqlo has 49 stores in Russia and while it will ""monitor the situation"" it has no plans to suspend trading. A number of Western firms such as Zara and H&M, have halted operations in Russia because of the war with Ukraine. But Fast Retailing's founder Tadashi Yanai said Russia's people ""have the same right to live as we do"". Mr Yanai told Japan's Nikkei newspaper: ""There should never be war. Every country should oppose it,"" But he said: ""Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do."" Uniqlo is not alone in its decision to continue its operations in Russia, despite a number of firms exiting the country in reaction to its invasion of Ukraine. Many international firms that rely on production plants and customer bases in Russia have chosen to stay in the country. Though, food and drink giants McDonald's and Coca-Cola have announced plans to close operations in Russia after being criticised, Burger King and KFC restaurants remain open. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, said it had suspended all investment in Russia ""while we continue to assess additional options"". The company - which has about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia mostly run by franchisees - is not pulling out of the country, but says it will ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. It has also committed $3m (Â£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people feeling to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers. The world's largest yoghurt maker, French firm Danone, has said it will not commit new investment to Russia but will continue to sell dairy, water bottles and baby food in the country. ""It is very easy to get drawn into black-and-white thinking and demagogic positions, but in the end our reputation is about our behaviour,"" chief executive Antoine de Saint-Affriquetold the Financial Times.,external Danone dairy production at one of its biggest plants in the Russian town of Chekhov ""We have a responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk, and the tens of thousands of people who depend on us."" Danone has 8,000 workers across 10 sites in Russia. Tobacco giant Philip Morris International was the leading foreign company by revenue in Russia in 2020. It has suspended operations in Ukraine but not Russia. Japan Tobacco, which has a 37% share of the Russian market and 4,500 employees in the country, also continues to operate in Russia. Its tax payments in 2020 accounted for 1.4% of the Russian Federation state budget according to the company's website.Japan Tobacco says it is ""fully committed"" to complying with national and international sanctions. British American Tobacco (BAT) has 2,500 workers across 76 offices in Russia and continues to sell cigarettes in the country where it has operated for more than 30 years. ""BAT always complies with relevant regulation and legislation wherever we operate, and we are aligned with all international sanctions,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.  ""We continue to closely monitor the situation as it evolves."" Russia is carmaker Renault's second-biggest market and accounts for around 12% of Renault's revenue, about $5.5bn (Â£4.2bn). The French government currently has a 15% stake in Renault and is its most important investor in terms of voting rights. The French company has not made any statements on the issue and has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of Russia, and has stopped all new investment, media and advertising in the country. However, the firm said it will continue to supply its ""everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia"" to people in the country. Operations at the firm's sites in Moscow, Omsk, Saint-Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Tula remain open. Unilever - whose brands include Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Domestos and Dove - employs 3,000 people in Russia.

We will not speculate on any potential sanctions. Responding to Ukrainian deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov's letter and tweet calling on the company to leave Russia, Japanese conglomerate Hitachi said it ""continues to monitor the situation closely"".

"Keeping Bulb Energy running will potentially cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than has currently been set aside, government officials have said. Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, was quasi-nationalised in late November when it was put into special administration as it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices. In November, wholesale prices were around Â£2 per unit. Since then, prices have been consistently higher than that. They hit peaks of Â£4.70 in December and as high as Â£8 on Monday - 20 times the prices seen last year - during extreme volatility. At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside Â£1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it was hoped a buyer would be found for the business. Government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in this environment and that means that taxpayers will be on the hook for a gas bill that energy analysts believe could run to billions of pounds. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy firm Bulb set to go into administration A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Special Administrator of Bulb is obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible, and we continue to engage closely with them throughout to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers."" The extreme volatility in energy markets has seen some customers prepared to pay Â£3,500 a year to fix their energy bills for two years, according to another large energy operator. That is well above the energy price cap of Â£1,971 that comes into effect in April but that cap is subject to potential further increases every six months. Industry analysts estimate the next energy price cap could be set at Â£3,000 or more from October. Other energy retailers are reluctant to offer or recommend customers lock in at such high prices as they fear they could be trapped on high tariffs if and when prices return to more normal levels. Some may be prepared to pay a high price for the peace of mind conferred by knowing what their outgoings will be. Millions of customers will simply be unable to afford energy bills later this year - despite the government's two-stage Â£9bn energy bill support package. This will offer consumers a Â£150 council tax rebate in April and a Â£200 loan in October to be repaid at Â£40 a year for the next five years.

Eventually, Misha spoke to a Border Force official who advised him to head across town to a port building - where he was met with the chocolate and crisps. ""Another week stuck here,"" he lamented. ""I have never claimed a benefit in my life and the first time I ask my government for their help, this is how they treat me. I am gutted."" For the hundreds of refugees in Calais, there appears to be a gap as wide as the English Channel between the supportive rhetoric of ministers in London and the reality on the ground.

"This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile Ukraine's military has released several videos showing Russian helicopters being shot down by surface-to-air missiles. One, from last week, shows a Russian helicopter flying low, just above the tree line - in the hope of avoiding what's about to happen next. Tracking its path is the smoking trail of a surface-to-air missile. In a matter of seconds the missile has found its target. On impact the Russian helicopter crashes to the ground, before bursting into a fireball Russian aircraft are being shot down by Ukrainian forces - as well as the video above,this video shows a jet hit near Kharkiv- and military analysts believe there's evidence that recently supplied weapons by the West are already being used. Justin Bronk, a research fellow on airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says there's been visual confirmation of at least 20 Russian aircraft shot down in Ukraine so far - both helicopters and jets. That's significantly fewer than claimed by Ukraine's ministry of defence, which says it has downed48 Russian planes and 80 helicopters.,externalYet even the lower number shows Russia's struggled to gain supremacy in the skies. Ukraine has suffered losses too. But UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that Russia had so far not been successful in destroying the country's air defences and air force. Before the war began, Ukraine's military aircraft were outnumbered at least three-to-one by those that had been amassed on the border by Russia. Mr Wallace said Ukraine's ability to keep some of its air defences intact was already forcing Russian aircraft to fly at night to avoid detection. Shoulder-launched air defence missiles, also known as Manpads (man-portable air defence systems) are just one of the weapons that Western nations have been supplying to Ukraine. They include the infamous US-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles - scourge of Soviet aircraft during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Exact numbers are hard to come by. Last week Mr Wallace told the BBC the West had now delivered ""thousands"" of anti-tank weapons and ""over a thousand"" Stingers. CNN, quoting a US defence official, put the total at 17,000 anti-tank weapons and 2,000 Stingers, sent by the US and Nato allies. Britain and America had provided weapons to Ukraine before the invasion began on 24 February, with the UK delivering 2,000 light anti-tank missiles (Nlaws). Commenting on reports that they were already being used to destroy Russian armoured columns, Mr Wallace said ""we've got anecdotal evidence to verify that"". Most countries, though, only started to send weapons in response to the Russian invasion. In all, 14 nations have supplied arms. They include Sweden and Finland, both of which have a long history of neutrality and are not members of Nato. But both have sent thousands of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany has supplied 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. The Baltic states have also delivered thousands of weapons including Stingers and Javelin missiles, one of the world's most effective anti-tank weapons with a range of 2.5km (1.5 miles). Ukraine says it has already successfully destroyed several Russian T-72 tanks. Recent weapons deliveries also include tens of thousands of assault rifles and machine guns, anti-tank mines and hundreds of tonnes of ammunition, as well as body armour and helmets, and medical supplies. A blown-off tank turret near Kharkiv - the West has supplied anti-tank weapons to Ukraine How are the weapons getting through? The UK says it is helping ""facilitate"" the deliveries of these weapons. Western officials, though, are not giving details of how the supplies are getting through. But it's no secret that while Russia's military operations have been focused in eastern Ukraine, the flow of people and supplies from the west of the country has continued via neighbouring European states. The BBC has spoken to the defence ministries of Estonia, Sweden and Denmark, all of whom confirmed their weapons supplies had been tracked and successfully reached Ukraine in recent weeks. So, how much difference are these weapons consignments making? Weapons supplied by the West can make a difference, but only if Ukraine continues to have armed forces capable of using them. Mr Bronk says Ukraine's ability to retain some of its older, Soviet-era, air defence systems - which have a longer range - has forced Russian aircraft to fly lower. But that makes them more vulnerable to the shorter-range surface-to-air missiles being supplied by the West. Without those longer-range air defence systems, Russian aircraft could fly higher to avoid the dangers of shorter-range air defences. Meanwhile, America and European allies are looking to increase their arms supplies to Ukraine. There may be a limited opportunity before Russia tries to target any supply lines of weapons. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said he's had talks with Poland about it supplying Russian-made Mig fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. But even if that happened, Ukraine would still need trained pilots to fly them. The supply of Western weapons helps, but you still need an army that knows how to use them.

"The BBC's Clive Myrie, who has left Ukraine, reflects on the indomitable locals he met in Kyiv - convinced they would defeat the Russians. I didn't really see her face, but at her feet were several cooing pigeons. Every now and again, a shower of birdseed would tumble from her hand. She was wearing a heavy-looking grey coat, keeping out the late morning winter chill. I motioned to my colleague, cameraman David McIlveen, to try to take her picture - but she sensed he was approaching, emptied the brown paper bag of birdseed and briskly walked away. It was the first time in 48 hours that I had left our lodgings - a basement car park in the heart of Kyiv which had become a make-shift bomb shelter. A weekend-long curfew had been imposed after Russian troops had invaded the country.  There was a real fear foreign saboteurs were moving among the population and anyone caught outdoors would have been arrested. You could see the nervousness on the faces of the soldiers and partisans manning checkpoints, despite the black balaclavas shielding them from the cold. Their eyes told stories of apprehension, concern, worry and existential threat. Russian spies might be plotting routes for incoming troops, or smuggling weapons into the Ukrainian capital, or simply there to somehow sow seeds of discord among ordinary people to break local unity. The city was awash with rumour and dread. Who might that be in the bomb shelter next to you, who is listening in to your conversation in the bread queue? Best stay indoors and observe the curfew. The woman feeding the pigeons would have spent the past two days in her own basement as well, and I thought it was interesting that one of the first things she did was to feed the pigeons - as if nothing was awry. An ordinary day out, a bit of fresh air, with no threat of death from above. A few other people were on the streets, queuing outside a supermarket which had little on its shelves. Most people were shuttered at home. Villages, towns and cities across the land saw a vanishing, as citizens descended underground to subterranean worlds of refuge. Vladimir Putin professes to know what the 40 million-plus population of this land want. A few days among these people would have told him much more than he seems to understand. In an elegant apartment block in the centre of Kyiv, one flat has become a sort of commune for young people who have just moved to the city from the sticks and need a place to crash while they find their feet. It is clean and tidy with a mattress for a sofa in the main room - but still the paraphernalia of student life is on show. There are several guitars lying around and posters on the wall. Giorgy, our local fixer and driver, introduces us to some of his friends. All are in their early 20s and have been waiting tables or studying at college. Oleksiy, 22, a waiter in a local bar, also plays in a rock band. Now, all that's on hold. He may have to fight the Russians. ""I am prepared to die for my country, for what I love,"" he told me in perfect English. ""Putin doesn't understand we don't want his authority - his world. All of us here know what we want - the right to live our own lives, the right to choose who leads us. That's our right, not Moscow's."" Ukrainian volunteer soldiers, Kyiv, 4 March 2022 I had met other reserve army volunteers who'd put themselves forward to fight while I was in Ukraine. They all displayed the same patriotism and love of their country that Vladimir Putin didn't think existed. They were firm in their convictions and convinced they would prevail - despite the Russian military's greater numbers. While speaking to Oleksiy, there was a commotion outside with the sound of police sirens in the street below. A long convoy of Ukrainian military vehicles was heading up the road and bystanders were applauding the troops. It was clear the Kremlin thought these people would be cowed by Moscow's ostentatious display of might, with Russian troops stationed on the Ukrainian border for several weeks to intimidate. Not a chance. These people will fight. The teenage Russian conscripts in their tanks and armoured personnel carriers who had crossed the border to the north, south and east, have quickly become disabused of Putin's jaundiced view of Ukraine. After the invasion, video footage began to emerge of Ukrainians berating the foreign army, yelling at them ""Go home"" and ""We don't want you here."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground SYMBOL:Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war sign? VIRAL:False claims that war is a hoax EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict And this was happening even in Russian-speaking parts of the north-east. There were pictures of people lying in the road to block the movement of Russian tanks. Others were throwing bicycles beneath tank tracks - there were no flowers or garlands of welcome. Pictures of Ukrainian men urinating on Russian vehicles, and a dog cocking a hind leg on the tail fin of a missile sticking out of the ground, went viral. On Twitter, one person quipped ""give piss a chance!"" On a visit to the magnificent St Sophia Cathedral - a stunning riot of frescoes and gold - I watched an interfaith prayer service for peace, as the war raged across the country. Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim - all were united. A little later, Ukraine's interior minister Denys Monastyrskyy in a bullet-proof vest turned up seeking divine guidance. Four heavily armed Ukrainian army soldiers were protecting him. I asked him if faith was what underpinned the Ukrainian belief that they could defeat the second-largest army on the planet. Speaking softly, he was unequivocal and clear-eyed - just like the young Ukrainian reservists I had spoken to days earlier. ""God is on our side,"" he told me with deep conviction. ""We will win."" And to drive home the point, he repeated those words in Ukrainian: ""My vyhrayemo"". Also attending the prayer service was military chaplain Oleksandr Mishura. He had a yellow armband on his right bicep, the insignia of the volunteer brigades - or the citizen soldiers. He said morale was high among the troops he ministered to, and that the soldiers had no choice but to fight to defend and protect the country. He took my arm and looked straight at me. He shared a sentiment that I suspect many in Ukraine believe - ""We all know what the Bible says, when the enemy is wicked, God will always intervene."" Shortly before my assignment in Kyiv ended, I began to think about the people I would leave behind to an uncertain fate. They included a mother and her 18-year-old daughter who shared our underground shelter. One morning, the daughter's crying woke me up. She had got word that her father, who had been living near the Chernobyl nuclear plant, had apparently been harmed by a group of Russian soldiers. They had ransacked his house looking for cigarettes and alcohol. The teenager feared the worst. Throughout the day she tried to call her father, but he wasn't picking up the phone. All of us in the shelter prayed he was still alive. When word finally came from his neighbour, that he was safe and unharmed, it felt like a tiny victory for all of us. I thought about the other dwellers of the underground shelter. The woman with a very large white fluffy cat and the children who had run around playing games oblivious to the madness of adults above ground. I am writing this from a hotel in Romania having left Ukraine via Moldova a couple of days ago. I can't get the image of the woman feeding the pigeons out of my head. She was risking bombs and missiles to feed the pigeons. For me, she represents strength and courage - the indomitability of an independent state, not the cowering fear of the colonised.

"Countries such as Yemen depend heavily on Russia and Ukraine for their wheat The head of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, has warned the conflict in Ukraine could send global food prices soaring, with a catastrophic impact on the world's poorest. Ukraine and Russia are both major exporters of basic foodstuffs, and the war has already hit crop production, driving up prices Mr Beasley said it was putting more people at risk of starvation worldwide. ""Just when you think hell on earth can't get any worse, it does,"" he said. Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally. Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices. Mr Beasley told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme that the number of people facing potential starvation worldwide had already risen from 80 million to 276 million in four years prior to Russia's invasion, due to what he calls a ""perfect storm"" of conflict, climate change and coronavirus. He said certain countries could be particularly affected by the current crisis, due to the high proportion of grains they currently import from the Black Sea region. David Beasley runs the World Food Programme ""The country of Lebanon, 50%, give or take, of their grains, come from Ukraine. Yemen, Syria, Tunisia - and I could go on and on - depend on the country of Ukraine as a breadbasket,"" he said. ""So you're going from being a breadbasket to now, literally, having to hand out bread to them. It's just an incredible reverse of reality."" Norwegian chemical company Yara International, a major fertiliser producer which operates in more than 60 countries, told the BBC a shortage could badly hit crop yields, leading to ""a global food crisis"". Ukrainian lawyer Ivanna Dorichenko, an expert in international trade arbitration, said some farmers in Ukraine have already abandoned their fields in order to take up arms against the Russian invasion. She told the BBC: ""The men who need to work on the land, they're all defending our land right now. Because if they do not defend the land, there'll be nothing to work on at a later stage, and you don't have a single person right now who's not trying to help in any way they can."" Ms Dorichenko said the war had wreaked havoc with supply lines typically used to export agricultural produce. Ukraine's military suspended all commercial shipping at its ports in the aftermath of the Russian invasion. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' Fears of UK food and fuel prices rising due to war ""The vessels cannot leave the waters, the vessels cannot get loaded. It's effectively a war zone. Sadly, there's nothing which can be potentially shipped right now from Ukraine."" She said it meant ""huge losses"" for businesses, but also humanitarian efforts, because Ukraine could no longer send goods to regions such as South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to groups such the World Food Programme. With food price inflation already at crisis point in some countries prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine, South African economist Wandile Sihlobo said he was worried about the potential consequences for grain-importing nations in Africa and beyond. Mr Sihlobo, chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, told the BBC that while steep price rises may be a problem in the short-term, shortages of essential crops could follow. ""Over time, depending on the length and the severity of this war, you could begin to see shortages of shipments that come to the African continent, and that could cause shortages. Particularly in the North African countries, and to an extent in East Africa."" He added: ""If you were to look at the global food price index, it was at multiple highs at the start of this year. This crisis already adds to that difficult environment for many consumers, particularly in the developing world."" On Monday, one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies, Yara International,warned the conflict could hit its industry, further affecting food prices. Fertiliser prices had already been rising due to soaring wholesale gas prices. Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow.

"This footage from a 2020 TV series is being shared with claims it shows actors being made up to be victims of the Ukraine war Nearly two weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the flow of false or misleading information about the war hasn't let up and now there are some outlandish theories being shared online.

A video of a young woman and a young man having fake blood applied to their faces has racked up millions of views on multiple platforms. It is shared as supposed evidence that the war in Ukraine is a hoax and civilian victims are actually ""crisis actors"" - people hired to act out scenes from an attack.

Social media posts claim the video was shot in Ukraine and proves the war is either a hoax or manufactured by ""Western propaganda"".

A screenshot of a Fox News broadcast showing two Ukrainian men holding what appear to be wooden guns has gone viral. It is often accompanied by false claims that the war in Ukraine is a hoax and the fact that they are not real guns is proof of this. Fake guns were given to civilian volunteers willing to train to defend their communities before the war The footage actually dates back to mid-February, before the war began. It was taken during a training course provided by the far-right Azov battalion for civilian volunteers in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv willing to defend themselves and their communities in case of a Russian invasion. Ukraine invasion: Misleading claims continue to go viral Ukraine conflict: Further false images shared online Ukraine conflict: Many misleading images shared online A false tweet - seemingly sent by CNN's verified Twitter account - claims US actor Steven Seagal, who is a dual US-Russian national, has been spotted ""among Russian special forces"" near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. Along with ordinary users, the tweet has been picked up by influential accounts with huge followings, including US podcast host Joe Rogan, who shared it with his 14 million followers on Instagram. A false tweet about Steven Seagal fighting in Ukraine was shared by Joe Rogan But Mr Seagal is not fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, and the tweet was probably generated by one of the multiple free online tools that enables users to create fake - but authentic-looking - tweets from verified accounts. The actor, 69, told Fox News last weekhe looked at both countries as ""one family"",externaland hoped for a ""positive, peaceful resolution"". CNN said the image was fabricated,externaland it had ""never reported anything like this"". Mr Rogan later deleted his Instagram post. A Russian diplomat has shared screenshots showing a fabricated story about a journalist being killed in Ukraine during the Russian invasion. ""How to make a fakeâ¦ colleagues, beware, the main battle is not in Ukraine, it's with lies and fakes of MSM"" tweeted Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN, referring to ""mainstream media"" as MSM. His post was accompanied by a tweet alleging that CNN had reported on the death of ""Bernie Gores"" in Ukraine, after sharing a story about the same man's demise in Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover last year. An image of YouTuber Jordie Jordan was used with a false identity to claim he was reported as dead in Ukraine by CNN But the screenshots presented as proof of fabrication come from fake CNN accounts - both of which have since been suspended by Twitter.

"Shell has pledged to stop buying oil from Russia as it apologised for its purchase of cheap Russian crude at the weekend. The energy giant also said it would close all its service stations in the country and stop all current work there. Shell came under huge criticism at the weekend after it purchased a cargo of Russian crude at a discounted price. Its boss said on Tuesday, however, that it was wrong to buy Russian oil. ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Mr van Beurden said. The company said it will immediately stop purchasing Russian crude oil and will shut about 500 service stations there, as well as halting its aviation fuel and lubricant operations in the country. The rest of the company's exit from Russian oil and gas is expected to take some time. The Ukrainian foreign minister had hit out at the firm on social media after it emerged Shell had bought crude.

""Doesn't Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you,"" asked Dmytro Kuleba. Exiting the Russia market is ""a complex challenge,"" admitted Mr van Beurden. ""Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer."" When Shell was forced to defend its purchase of Russian crudeover the weekend, it insisted that it had ""no alternative"" in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. Russian oil currently makes up about 8% of Shell's working supplies. One of the firm's refineries, which produces diesel and petrol and other products, is also among the biggest in Europe. Cargoes from other sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply, it said. Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft It still remains unclear, however, how exactly Shell will replace the volume of energy produced by Russia. ""These societal challenges highlight the dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies across Europe,"" said Mr van Beurden. ""But ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made during the war in Ukraine."" He added that the firm would continue to work with governments on how to manage any potential impact on energy supplies. Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden apologised for buying discounted Russian crude oil. And any profits it generates from remaining Russian oil will go to dedicated funds aimed at helping people affected by the war in Ukraine. The move follows previous announcements by the company, which set out its plans to end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom following the invasion. That will involve the company selling its 27.5% stake in a major liquefied natural gas plant and a 50% stake in two oilfield projects in Siberia. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. The 1,200km pipeline under the Baltic Seahad already been put on hold by German ministers. Shell said that it expected the move would cost about $3bn (Â£2.2bn) and followed on from BP announcing it would offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft, which it has held since 2013. BP's stake in Rosneft is valued at around $25bn. Extracting a company like Shell from the Russian energy market is a complex business. Unlike BP, which owns a 19.75% financial stake in Rosneft which it intends to walk away from, Shell has complex operations with thousands of employees on the ground. Extricating itself from long-term supply contracts will take months. Buying a cargo of Russian crude at knock-down prices as other companies shunned Russian supplies drew outrage on social media and, according to Shell sources, dismay from its own employees in Ukraine. The company insists it had to buy the cargo to avoid disruptions to operations at its huge refinery in Pernis, Rotterdam, and was not ""trying to make a quick buck"". But that explanation drew scepticism in some quarters and the chief executive apologised today, saying it had been the wrong thing to do.  The company also said that phasing out Russian oil and gas would need to be done carefully to minimise the damage done to the rest of the world. A reminder that the tougher the sanction, the greater the collateral damage on those imposing them. Shell's plans emerged asa warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin warnedthat it would close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted, as Shell has pointed out. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.

"Pressure is growing on Western food and drink giants to pull out of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. McDonald's and Coca-Cola have been criticised on social media for failing to speak out about the attacks and continuing to operate in the country. Well-known firms includingNetflix and Levi's have already suspended salesor stopped providing services in Russia. McDonald's and Coca-Cola have not responded to the BBC's request for comment. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola were trending on Twitter on Monday and over the weekend respectively. Dragon's Den investor Deborah Meaden also spoke out on social media against the fizzy drinks company, urging people to stop drinking its products. Allow Twitter content?

The criticism comes amid calls for other well-known Western firms such as KFC, Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King to close their outlets and stop sales in Russia. However, most firms have stayed silent on the issue with Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King also declining to respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Fast food chain KFC did not respond initially but its owner Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut, has since announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia. Yum Brands is the world's second-biggest restaurant chain, and there are about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia. The company was not pulling out entirely, but Yum said that it would ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". It is also donating $1m (Â£762,000) to the Red Cross. Many of the firms the BBC has contacted have a large number of stores in the country. In recently-published informationon its website,external, McDonald's said that it has 847 stores in Russia. The company also owns the majority of these outlets, whereas across the rest of the world most are typically operated by franchisees. Both McDonald's and Pepsi, who have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also been singled out by the boss of New York state's pension fund. The oldest Russian McDonald's branch, off Pushkin Square in central Moscow, opened in 1990. Thomas DiNapoli, comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote letters to the companies, according to Reuters reports, urging them to review their businesses in Russia because they face ""significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks"". Often, franchise owners will be able to take the decision as to whether or not to shut chains down, depending on terms of agreements they might have with big food chains like KFC or Starbucks. In a recent statement, Kevin Johnson, the boss of Starbucks, described attacks on Ukraine as ""unprovoked"" and ""unjust"". But most of its sites in Russia remain open, according to its website. Most of these franchises are run by the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group. Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald's and Coca-Cola were ""very complicated businesses"", which would not make it easy to make a decision to leave Russia quickly. She told the BBC's Today programme that Coca-Cola had an ""incredibly complicated structure"" with bottling plants in Russia. ""I don't think it's as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,"" she said. ""These are complicated businesses and there's a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward."" But Dr Ian Peters, director of the Institute for Business Ethics, told BBC News: ""This is not a time to sit on the fence. ""The world is likely to judge companies by what they do in such circumstances, and ethical judgement will be as important as complying with any government-led regulations and sanctions."" He said that most firms would have what they refer to as an ""ethical compass"" they use to make big decisions. ""We would advise firms in such circumstances always to look at the bigger picture and seek to do the right thing, putting the wider interest above short-term profit,"" he added. He cited important ethical dilemmas that might come up for companies when considering to suspend operations in Russia too: What duty of care do these companies hold to employees on the ground? Is it fair to deprive Russian citizens of basic goods? Professor of business ethics at Henley Business School, Kleio Akrivou, suggested that these types of decisions might be more difficult to reach for food companies than, say, consulting firms. ""When it comes to sanctions which deprive the Russian population of its basic goods and dignity, firms may need to approach the situation more thoughtfully, with an appeal to practical reason."" She said now is the time for fast food giants to balance how real people are affected by such moves, alongside any reputational risk.

"Shell has pledged to stop buying oil from Russia as it apologised for its purchase of cheap Russian crude at the weekend. The energy giant also said it would close all its service stations in the country and stop all current work there. Shell came under huge criticism at the weekend after it purchased a cargo of Russian crude at a discounted price. Its boss said on Tuesday, however, that it was wrong to buy Russian oil. ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Mr van Beurden said. The company said it will immediately stop purchasing Russian crude oil and will shut about 500 service stations there, as well as halting its aviation fuel and lubricant operations in the country. The rest of the company's exit from Russian oil and gas is expected to take some time. The Ukrainian foreign minister had hit out at the firm on social media after it emerged Shell had bought crude.

""Doesn't Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you,"" asked Dmytro Kuleba. Exiting the Russia market is ""a complex challenge,"" admitted Mr van Beurden. ""Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer."" When Shell was forced to defend its purchase of Russian crudeover the weekend, it insisted that it had ""no alternative"" in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. Russian oil currently makes up about 8% of Shell's working supplies. One of the firm's refineries, which produces diesel and petrol and other products, is also among the biggest in Europe. Cargoes from other sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply, it said. Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft It still remains unclear, however, how exactly Shell will replace the volume of energy produced by Russia. ""These societal challenges highlight the dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies across Europe,"" said Mr van Beurden. ""But ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made during the war in Ukraine."" He added that the firm would continue to work with governments on how to manage any potential impact on energy supplies. Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden apologised for buying discounted Russian crude oil. And any profits it generates from remaining Russian oil will go to dedicated funds aimed at helping people affected by the war in Ukraine. The move follows previous announcements by the company, which set out its plans to end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom following the invasion. That will involve the company selling its 27.5% stake in a major liquefied natural gas plant and a 50% stake in two oilfield projects in Siberia.

"This video can not be played Women discuss their experiences of public sexual harassment Women have been speaking about shocking incidents of sexual harassment - after a BBC poll found many often still feel unsafe walking alone at night. The new poll suggests 43% of women in the UK have experienced unwelcome touching or groping in public. The survey -conducted by YouGov,external- also indicates 28% of women have experienced indecent exposure in public. The chair of the Women and Equalities Committee said Boris Johnson must show he takes women's safety seriously. It follows growing pressure to make public sexual harassment a crime. Caroline Nokes, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told the BBC changing the law would send a ""really powerful message"" and could help tackle underlying causes of violent offences against women. ""It will give women the confidence to report and sends a very clear message to perpetrators that this is criminal,"" she said. How many violent attacks on women are there? Sarah Everard: The people trying to make change The survey found two thirds - 66% - of women said they did not feel safe walking alone at night, at least some of the time. That compared to just 39% of men who said they felt unsafe in the same situation. The findings come a year after the murder of Sarah Everard, who was abducted and murdered while walking home in south London. Ms Everard's killer, police officer Wayne Couzens, was previously linked to allegations of indecent public exposure. Hers and other high-profile cases in the past year have led to increased awareness and campaigning around women's safety and public sexual harassment. The BBC has also spoken to women across the UK about how sexual harassment impacts their lives. One, a woman named Sarah, was on her way to a morning exercise class in Edinburgh last year when a man followed and groped her before running off laughing and filming her reaction. ""I was incredibly shocked. I remember I felt incredibly angry as well,"" she told the BBC. ""I also felt a real invasion of privacy, the fact he had filmed the whole incident."" What happened to Sarah that day was the worst of a long history of experiences she and her friends remember going through over the years - from being groped in nightclubs as students to being shouted at by strangers in the street. ""We used to be catcalled all the time as teenagers going out. It was something we laughed off and shrugged off,"" she said. ""But as a woman now, everyone has become a lot more aware of how dangerous those things are and how hostile it is."" ""There's an absolute entitlement to touch and to talk to you in a manner that is completely inappropriate,"" she added. Sarah said the ""brazen"" assault by a stranger left her with a ""horrible feeling"" More than half of the women surveyed for the BBC said they avoided certain areas and being out at certain times to try to keep themselves safe from possible harassment and assault. Roxanne, 26, no longer feels confident walking alone after experiencing everything from obscene comments to unwanted touching when out in public since she was a teenager. Roxanne believes a door has opened for women to ""normalise"" speaking out about their experiences She now sticks to main roads when walking her dog and tries to only go out in daylight when she's by herself. Like 30% of women surveyed in the poll for the BBC, Roxanne says she wears flat shoes as a way to feel safer. She also carries a rape alarm, criminal identification spray and tries not to wear her hair in hairstyles such as ponytails she fears might be easier for an attacker to grab. ""I don't know who's going to harm me, when they're going to harm me - so I'm cautious of everybody,"" she said. ""And I think that's a natural and very common thing to feel with everything that's going on."" The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated 2.2% of the population aged between 16-59 were victims of sexual assault in the year ending March 2020 - a slight decrease on the year before. Public sexual harassment is not currently an offence in its own right. The term refers to unwanted sexual behaviour - from verbal comments to physical actions - which can leave victims feeling intimidated and degraded. The Law Commission - an independent body that advises the government on legal changes - recommended in December that ministers should consider creating a specific criminal offence for it during a review into hate crime laws. Ms Nokes believes criminalising public sexual harassment could help intervene in escalating offender journeys to ensure ""today's flasher does not become tomorrow's rapist"". ""I think the prime minister needs to step up and show that he does take women's safety seriously and that he's not interested in a few cosmetic measures like CCTV - but actually in legislative change with a cross-government approach,"" she said. Caroline Nokes told the BBC the government should do more to help women feel safe She believes current safety initiatives and advice place too much onus on women having to take precautions to try to protect themselves. ""Of course we want women to be safe and we want them to be vigilant, but this is about men attacking them when they are just going about their daily lives,"" she said. ""Women should be safe wherever they are, whatever they're doing, however they're dressed."" Ms Nokes also supports cultural and education reforms - including with mandatory consent classes in schools, colleges and universities. Nathaniel Horne works for a charity that runs workshops for boys and men aimed at tackling misogyny and encouraging healthier relationships. Nathaniel Horne says ""all men can be better"" to help women feel more safe and change attitudes in society ""It's important to talk to people about this stuff early,"" he told the BBC about going into schools. ""Because I think once people are adults, and they've been out for a while, that can be entrenched in those views and those behaviours."" The view is echoed by April-Joy Serrant, who last year was exposed to by a man performing a sex act in public while out on a run. As a mother of three sons, she says her experience has changed how she speaks with her children about relationships and content they may be exposed to. After posting a video about her experience online, she was overwhelmed by other women and girls getting in touch with their own experiences of the ""day in, day out"" harassment. ""It had never crossed my mind until the incident that I experienced last year that my husband can go for a walk or for a run and it never crosses his mind,"" she said. ""And that is freedom."" The Home Office told the BBC that tacking violence against women and girls ""remains one of the top priorities of this government"". ""We are committed to ensuring that existing laws on public sexual harassment are effective but we continue to look carefully at where there may be gaps and how a specific offence could address those,"" safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean said in a statement."" She said the government last week launched a new national communications campaign and said violence against women had now been made a priority for police forces, alongside national threats like terrorism.

"The UK and EU said they remain determined to find ""durable solutions"" to the issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol. The two sides issued a joint statement after a meeting of senior officials. The negotiators met in a body known as the Specialised Committee. It deals with technical issues and can make recommendations to the lead negotiators, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. The statement said: ""Both parties underlined their ongoing determination to ensure that outstanding issues in the context of the protocol are addressed, and durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. ""In addition, the EU and the UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups, civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements."" Officials representing the NI Executive attended the meeting as part of the UK delegation. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ The protocol isthe Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish borderby keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. The EU has agreed in principle that GB goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than those which are due to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. But there is still a big difference between the UK and EU about how that should be implemented and what should be considered a reasonable level of risk to the EU single market. The NI Protocol and its economic impact A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The joint committee previously met in late February. At that time Mrs Truss and Mr Å efÄoviÄ said they weredetermined that outstanding issues would be addressed. A senior EU official suggested that the talks would happen in a more ""discreet"" way in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May. It is not yet clear if, or how, the war in Ukraine will affect the negotiations. Mrs Truss and Mr Å efÄoviÄ have previously made a joint statement expressing a wish for ""a positive EU-UK relationship"" which would allow for ""co-operation on common global challenges"". Last week, Mrs Truss was a guest at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels alongside the US secretary of state and Canada's foreign minister.

The term refers to unwanted sexual behaviour - from verbal comments to physical actions - which can leave victims feeling intimidated and degraded. The Law Commission - an independent body that advises the government on legal changes - recommended in December that ministers should consider creating a specific criminal offence for it during a review into hate crime laws. Ms Nokes believes criminalising public sexual harassment could help intervene in escalating offender journeys to ensure ""today's flasher does not become tomorrow's rapist"". ""I think the prime minister needs to step up and show that he does take women's safety seriously and that he's not interested in a few cosmetic measures like CCTV - but actually in legislative change with a cross-government approach,"" she said. Caroline Nokes told the BBC the government should do more to help women feel safe She believes current safety initiatives and advice place too much onus on women having to take precautions to try to protect themselves. ""Of course we want women to be safe and we want them to be vigilant, but this is about men attacking them when they are just going about their daily lives,"" she said. ""Women should be safe wherever they are, whatever they're doing, however they're dressed."" Ms Nokes also supports cultural and education reforms - including with mandatory consent classes in schools, colleges and universities. Nathaniel Horne works for a charity that runs workshops for boys and men aimed at tackling misogyny and encouraging healthier relationships. Nathaniel Horne says ""all men can be better"" to help women feel more safe and change attitudes in society ""It's important to talk to people about this stuff early,"" he told the BBC about going into schools. ""Because I think once people are adults, and they've been out for a while, that can be entrenched in those views and those behaviours."" The view is echoed by April-Joy Serrant, who last year was exposed to by a man performing a sex act in public while out on a run. As a mother of three sons, she says her experience has changed how she speaks with her children about relationships and content they may be exposed to. After posting a video about her experience online, she was overwhelmed by other women and girls getting in touch with their own experiences of the ""day in, day out"" harassment. ""It had never crossed my mind until the incident that I experienced last year that my husband can go for a walk or for a run and it never crosses his mind,"" she said. ""And that is freedom."" The Home Office told the BBC that tacking violence against women and girls ""remains one of the top priorities of this government"". ""We are committed to ensuring that existing laws on public sexual harassment are effective but we continue to look carefully at where there may be gaps and how a specific offence could address those,"" safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean said in a statement."" She said the government last week launched a new national communications campaign and said violence against women had now been made a priority for police forces, alongside national threats like terrorism.

"A little girl clutches a doll at a checkpoint on the Ukraine-Slovakia border In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to a terrifying new reality. How do you tell young children that you're at war? Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. They live in a 24-storey apartment block with an underground car park, where people are sleeping on the concrete floor. It's bitterly cold, and Anton is worried about what might happen if the building collapses, so he and his family feel safer in a square concrete well between the lifts. That has become their sanctuary during the constant air raid sirens. They bring toys and their son's tablet and make sure he sits in the corner, which is the safest place. Anton says their son is worried, and asks lots of questions. ""Yesterday, my wife went downstairs and when she returned, he was asking, 'Mum, did they shoot you?' and she said 'No baby', and he said, 'Will they shoot me? I don't want them to go bang-bang'."" How to deal with your anxiety about the Ukraine crisis Anton says some parents have sewn badges with their child's blood group on to their clothes and are teaching them their home address and parents' names, in case they are separated. And while they hide in shelters or try to board trains to safety, many parents are also talking to each other about how the war is affecting their children, and how best to protect them from trauma. ""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. ""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary."" His own son's drawings don't appear to show any signs of trauma, but some of Anton's friends have older children, and the pictures they draw clearly show they've been affected by the situation. A friend of Anton's shared her four-year-old son's drawing after spending the night in a bomb shelter - it shows people fleeing a big red devil The parents and staff from his son's nursery stay in touch via the social media app Telegram, where they share advice about how to talk to the children about what's going on. This even included a tutorial on how to explain to the kids why it was OK for adults to swear now, while it was not OK in normal life. ""Because people are swearing right now,"" says Anton. They have become more relaxed about other little things, too. ""Because of this situation, he has to watch much more cartoons than normal, and is eating much more sweets than normal. We need something to occupy him - he has to not pay too much attention to what's going on. ""The psychologists advise us to be gentler with kids in these times, and to love them much more than usual,"" says Anton. When it comes to safety, though, they have to be quite strict. Their three-year-old quickly learned that when there's a siren, the family have to run and hide. ""As soon as we hear sirens or get a notification we shout, 'To the shelter!' and whatever he's doing he leaves it and runs. He understands that the situation is extraordinary. It even surprises us how well children understand the necessity to behave properly."" Evacuees and a child, sitting on top of a suitcase, wait for a train to Romania from Lviv As the Russian shelling gets worse and the convoys close in, many Ukrainian parents have decided to flee their homes with their young children in tow. Hanna, a scientist, left Kyiv and travelled to Poland with her two sons, who are eight and six years old. For days, they had been at home listening to explosions, the windows trembling, and she somehow had to tell them what was going on. She found it hard to strike a balance between reality and how much a child's mind can take. ""This was a challenge for me as a mother because I have to choose between how to explain the truth, but at the same time not to scare them too much,"" she says. ""So I was just telling them that we are under attack, and at the moment we are safe, but when we feel we have to move, they have to listen."" Her parenting style had to change, too - there was no room for discussion. ""Normally I ask them to do something, but this is a time to get orders."" A child on a swing outside a residential building in Kyiv damaged by a missile After a few days of shelling, Hanna felt she no longer wanted her children to hear the bombs and decided to leave Ukraine. ""It was a very, super hard decision,"" she says. Her children had to make a hard decision too - they could only take one of their toys. Her eldest chose Toothless, a toy dragon from the How to Train your Dragon series, and her youngest chose a Transformer toy car that turns into a robot. It was a huge decision for them, says Hanna - perhaps as momentous as it was for her to leave her country. ""I think that we were in the same emotional decision-taking position."" It took them 52 hours to reach safety in Poland. Hanna's ex-husband came with them for the first part of the car journey but then had to turn back, to fight. Hanna says travelling in a war zone with two kids was exhausting and she can understand why many of her friends are choosing to stay nearer home. Now they are safe, but the boys ask lots of questions, about their grandparents and especially their father, who has stayed behind. ""Heart-breaking questions, because they ask me every day if he is alive, or if he still has his hands and legs. They are afraid that he can get super hurt."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo ANALYSIS:Europe finally steps up EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hanna tells them to try and live in the present. ""All we have is just now. At the moment we are safe,"" she says. How much to tell their children is something all parents are having to weigh up. Oksana fled her home town of Lviv, in the west, and is now also in Poland. Her six-year-old daughter is autistic and hates loud noises, so she found the air raid sirens very scary. She could tell her mother was nervous too, so Oksana told her the truth about what was happening. ""I was explaining that it's a war and we need to be safe, and that a lot of people are dead now because of all this,"" says Oksana. ""I think it is important that when children are old enough to understand they are not misled, because they can sense the atmosphere is bad."" Iryna's son is just two, and she has decided not to tell him too much. After spending three nights in a bomb shelter they left Irpin, a small city near Kyiv, and went to western Ukraine. She told her son they were going to stay with friends, because he's too young to understand that they're in danger. ""I didn't tell him that it's a war. I'm not sure I have to when he's so young, because I think it makes this situation only worse."" As for Anton and his family, the Russian troops are closing in and they may have to evacuate soon. He's not sure where to. ""No-one knows which place is the safest - so it's gambling,"" he says. Hanna, Oksana and Iryna spoke toOutside Source on the BBC World Service.

"The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was an early casualty of Germany's change of heart over Russia You know that feeling when you're running downhill, going so fast that you seem to lose control of your own feet? That's where the EU appears to be at the moment. Crushing financial sanctions on Russia that hurt European business. Brussels purchasing and sending weapons to a non-EU country at war. Germany beefing up its military, despite post-World War Two queasiness. Staunchly neutral Finland and Sweden thinking of joining Nato. The bloc's asylum procedure pushed aside to accommodate fleeing Ukrainians, in what's described as Europe's biggest refugee crisis since 1945. Once dismissed as impossible - or at least, hugely improbable - from one day to the next, EU revolutions, provoked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, have been happening thick and fast. The next seismic change bubbling in Brussels? A looming energy revolution, provoked by a simple question: What's the point of punitive financial sanctions if Vladimir Putin's war chest is refilled on a daily basis with oil and gas revenues? The EU depends on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil imports. EU countries pay about â¬1bn a day to Moscow for those supplies, according to Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank. The US - which is far less reliant on Russian energy supplies than Europe - says it's considering banning Russian oil imports as part of its sanctions against the Kremlin. On Monday, standing next to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Lithuania's foreign minister agreed. ""We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood,"" he said. Along with other eastern European Nato and EU members, Lithuania views Vladimir Putin - with his ambitions to change Europe's geopolitical order in Moscow's favour - as an active security threat. The West must fight Russia ""with all means available"", said Lithuania's president. ""To avoid World War Three."" But other EU countries, such as big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports. Energy prices are already painfully high across the continent. Until Russia's attacks on Ukraine, the majority of Germans supported Nord Stream 2, their new gas pipeline direct from Russia. The pipeline has been frozen as part of EU sanctions against Russia, but Berlin fears public opinion could turn if Germans suddenly can't fill their cars with petrol or afford to heat their homes. Germany's Federation of Industries, the BDI, has warned that soaring prices could crush the EU's largest economy, forcing factory and other German business closures, with a rippling effect across the single market. Anti-nuclear sentiment has always been strong in Germany France's Emmanuel Macron is nervous too. He hopes to be re-elected president next month. The last time he was blamed for petrol price hikes in France, it sparked months of massive street protests by the ""gilets jaunes"", the yellow jackets, so-called because of the high-visibility vests they wore. So, while on the world stage, President Macron presents himself as the European champion of carbon neutrality, energy prices are such a sensitive issue in France that he introduced â¬100 bonuses for the poorest voters this winter, to mitigate fossil fuel prices as part of his re-election bid. It's notable, too, that French energy giant Total says it's staying put in Russia for now, despite the Kremlin's onslaught against Ukraine, while competitors BP and Shell have voluntarily pulled out. So are energy sanctions against Russia just the latest example of an ""EU impossible"" that will suddenly become reality? The issue will be discussed in the European Parliament on Tuesday and among EU leaders at their Thursday summit. When I speak to EU naysayers, they talk defensively, not only about the dangers of domestic blowback, but also potential aftershocks in the global energy market. ""At the moment, we're speaking with one voice alongside Latin America, regarding Russian aggression,"" one diplomat told me. ""But what would happen if the Argentine economy implodes as a result of energy price hikes and scarcity and the EU and the West is blamed for that?"" So for the moment, the EU is clinging to what it views as safer ground. On Monday, EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would be speeding up efforts to wean itself off Russian energy. These include: finding ""reliable"" alternative suppliers (such as Qatar and Azerbaijan) improving energy efficiency, eg renovating buildings and using artificial intelligence to effectively manage the energy grid ""massive investment"" in renewables such as solar, wind and hydrogen, already planned under the European Green Deal. Russia's actions in Ukraine mean Brussels now views the Climate Question as a question of security. Energy security. Germany's new chancellor took the world's breath away a week ago by reversing his country's defence policy, sending weapons to Ukraine and announcing a â¬100bn investment in the German military. His finance minister has also announced a â¬200bn investment in renewable and alternative energy sources. Germany's need is acute, as it has all but phased out nuclear energy, as well as phasing out coal. But those plans for renewable energies, alternative suppliers and a clean energy divorce from Russia will take time. Something Ukraine just does not have.

The Russian President has released anInternational Women's Day video,externalwhere he says that conscripts and reservists are not being called up to fight on the frontline. ""Let me emphasise that soldiers who are doing military service do not and
will not participate in hostilities... the assigned taks are solved only be professional military men,"" he said. In contrast, Ukraine's military effort is being heavily staffed by civilian sign-ups. Putin's message was aimed at allaying supposed concerns from Russian women - the ""mothers, wives, sisters, brides and girlfriends of our soldiers and officers who are now in battle."" ""I understand how you worry about your loved ones,"" he said. He broadly characterised women by their ""loyalty, reliability and support"" throughout this speech. ""Our dear women, you make the world better and kinder thanks to your sensitivity, compassion and spiritual generosity. You combine charming tenderness and amazing inner strength."" However, according to a report on 24 February by independent news outlet The Insider, there was evidence that some Russian conscripts had been forced to sign on before the invasion. The BBC has been unable to idependently verify this claim. Graph of most heavily-sanctioned countries in the world Russia has now overtaken Iran and Syria to become the most sanctioned country in the world, according to sanctions watchlist site Castellum.ai. According to the site, 2,754 sanctions were already in place against Russia before 22 February. A further 2,778 sanctions were imposed in the days following the invasion, bringing the total to 5,532 - outranking Iran's 3,616 sanctions and displacing it from the top position. The US made up the primary source of sanctions at 21%, followed closely behind by the UK's and the EU's combined total at 18%. Countries around the world have ramped up sanctions on Russia in an bid to intensify pressure on Moscow to stop its assault on Ukraine. Many residential houses in Kharkiv have been destroyed by Russian shelling Russia will declare a ""silence regime"" and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors in Ukraine at 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT), said Russian state media reports. They are quoting Russian defence ministry officials as saying this will be done to evacuate civilians from the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Most of the evacuation routes offered by Moscow are to Russia - a condition previously described as unacceptable by the government in Kyiv. Ukraine has not publicly commented on the new Russian initiative. Each of several previous evacuation attempts failed, with the warring sides blaming each other. Children are among the victims from aerial attacks on the city of Sumy and its surrounding suburbs late on Monday, according to a local Ukrainian military official. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, who leads the Sumy Regional Military Administration, said in a video posted on Facebook that after 23:00 local time Russian warplanes carried out strikes on the north-eastern city. ""Unfortunately, children are among those killed."" Zhyvytsky said, adding that more than 10 people were killed. The BBC could not independently verify the claims. ""The kids are being killed,"" he wrote in a Facebook post, sharing video of the reported attack. ""We will never forgive this!"" he later added. Australia energy company Viva said on Tuesday it would stop buying Russian crude oil, joining the growing list of companies distancing themselves from Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Viva, which operates under the Shell group of companies, said it was ""appalled"" at ""this terrible conflict"". ""As a consequence .. Viva Energy has made the decision to cease purchases of crude oil of Russian origin while the conflict continues,"" it added. Oil markets, particularly those in Europe, are scrambling to find alternative sources of oil as Russia contributes 13% of the world's crude petroleum exports. US lawmakers are pushing the Biden administration to send its fighter jets to Poland if Warsaw sends its planes to Kyiv. Poland is among a handful of Eastern European allies that retains an inventory of used Russian-made aircraft - which Ukrainian pilots know how to fly - and Ukraine's president has called for their transfer. Warsaw has not yet made a decision to transfer planes to Kyiv and the US government said it was ""Poland's sovereign decision to make"". The White House also added that logistical challenges mean such a transfer would not be ""as easy as just moving planes around"". But Bob Menendez, the US Senate's top lawmaker on foreign relations, called on his government to commit to backfilling the Polish fleet with upgraded aircraft from Washington. ""I will support efforts in the Senate to implement measures to compensate our allies that provide their aircraft for Ukraine's defence,"" he wrote. Reactor No 4 of Chernobyl nuclear power plant seen in an archival image The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said that, according to Ukrainian officials, a nuclear research facility producing radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes in Kharkiv has been damaged by shelling. There has been no increase in radiation levels at the facility. IAEA head, Rafael Mariano Grossi, also issued an appeal that staff at Chernobyl be given time off  ""so that they can carry out their work in a safe and reliable manner"". The nuclear agency said staff at the inactive plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986, have continued to work there since Russian forces took control of the facility on 24 February. Grossi  said he is willing to visit Chernobyl ""to obtain guarantees regarding the safety and security of all nuclear power plants in Ukraine from the parties to the conflict"". The World Bank has approved emergency financing of $723m (Â£552m) to help Ukraine's government pay public-sector wages, welfare and pensions. The bank said the package incorporated funding from the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland. The World Bank also says it is working to release a further $3bn (Â£2.3bn) for Ukraine and its neighbouring countries in the coming months.

Daria lives in Kyiv and has taken the decision not to leave the city as Russian forces advance on her home. Instead, the 28-year-old has moved to the basement of a local cafÃ© where a small group of people are baking pies to feed Ukrainian soldiers. Speaking toRadio 5 Live, Daria said she took the decision to stay in the city because she was born in an independent Ukraine and wants to ""keep this independence for the future"". Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. ""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. ""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary.""

The bloc currently imports nearly half of its gas and coal, and about a third of its oil, from Russia. EU leaders will discuss the proposed phase-out this Thursday and Friday at a gathering in Versailles, France. A draft statement reportedly refers to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as ""a tectonic shift in European history"". It sets out an objective of ""reducing our dependencies and designing a new growth and investment model for 2030"" by accelerating the development of renewables as well as by diversifying energy supplies and routes. Other Western leaders are also scrambling to prepare for potential shocks to global energy markets. Earlier on Monday, British PM Boris Johnson urged a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas. The US, which imports about 8% of its oil from Russia, has recently been trying to cut deals with major oil-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran. This video can not be played Irish medical student Racheal Diyaolu stranded in Ukraine Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from the Republic of Ireland, is one of hundreds of international students in Sumy, a Ukrainian city that has been attacked by Russia since Moscow's invasion last week. An attempt to get the medical student out of Sumy in a minivan on Sunday failed after the vehicle was unable to get into the city. Racheal - who has been sheltering in her university's bunker during air raid sirens - says she is now mentally ""blocking out"" the airstrikes and shelling. ""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid anymore,""she tells BBC News NI. Her family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring her home. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs says it is aware of 52 Irish citizens in Ukraine and was in contact with them. Almost 300 Ukrainians have been turned away while trying to cross to the UK from Calais, France. The number is almost the same as the total number of Ukrainian visas issued so far by the Home Office. Many refugees seek to cross the border from France to the UK through the port of Calais. About 589 people have arrived there since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, according to Calais' sub-prefect, VÃ©ronique Deprez-Boudier. She said 286 had been turned away by UK authorities. Some Ukrainians in Calais have told the BBC they face a wait of a week for an appointment to get a family reunion visa. But the Home Office insists visa application centres across Europe have appointments available this week. âItâs important to build a more organised team to accompany these people to get a visa here,"" Deprez-Boudier told BBC News. Some 17,700 people have applied to come to the UK as part of the Ukrainian Family Scheme, and 300 visas have been issued. Earlier on Monday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain was a ""very generous country"", but it wanted to maintain checks on who was arriving. Read more on Ukrainian refugees in Calaishere. Ukrainian military intelligence says Vitaly Gerasimov died near Kharkiv A top commander in the Russian army has been killed during fighting near Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's ministry of defence intelligence service. The BBC cannot independently verify the claim; Russian officials have not commented. According to a statement from Ukraineâs defence ministry, Vitaly Gerasimov was a major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia. A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded, it says. Ukrainian intelligence says Gerasimov took part in the second Chechen war and the Russian military operation in Syria. He received a medal ""for the return of Crimea"". Ukrainian officials tweeted out a photo of someone they said was Gerasimov, with the word ""Liquidated"" in red letters across the bottom. BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams shares this thought on reports of Gerasimov's death. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three more companies have curtailed their operations in Russia. IT services giant IBM will stop selling its technology in Russia and will not do business with Russian military organisations, according to a statement from its CEO Arvind Krishna. Krishna also said the company would match employee donations to the International Red Cross to support relief efforts in Ukraine. Consumer goods multinational Procter & Gamble also announced Monday that it would end all new capital investments in Russia, as well as all media, advertising and promotional activity. CEO Jon Moeller committed to ""significantly reducing our product portfolio"" in Russia to focus on basic health, hygiene and personal care items needed by Russians. German home improvement chain OBI said it would also leave Russia, where it has 27 branches and about 5,000 employees. According toanalysis by the Yale School of Management,external, some 230 Western companies have pulled out of Russia. It also listed a number of companies with ""significant exposure"" in Russia that continue to operate in the country, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Pepsi and Starbucks.

China has always said repeatedly that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of others French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are expected to hold a joint call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. The call signals a ramping up of pressure by European leaders on China over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Monday, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for the second time since the invasion began. According to a readout of their call, Borrell asked Wang about ""Chinaâs readiness to support cessation of hostilities and dialogue"" and support for establishing humanitarian corridors to safely evacuate civilians. China has expressed ""regret"" over the attack, but has done little to condemn or oppose Moscow, in line with the principles of its foreign policy. Read more: Can China do more to stop Russia's war in Ukraine? Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent There are two questions regarding China and
the war in Ukraine. Does it have enough leverage to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to call off the invasion? And, more crucially, how much does Beijing
want to use its standing with Russia to stop the war? Every year here in the Chinese capital, the foreign minister holds a press conference on the sidelines of the National
People's Congress. It is a highly scripted event, with
questions screened beforehand so you know the answers have been approved at the
highest levels of the Party. Today Wang Yi was asked if China was
disappointed with Russiaâs behaviour and whether its own international standing
had been diminished by Beijing's refusal to describe what is happening in
Ukraine as an ""invasion"". The foreign minister didn't respond
regarding the word ""invasion"", but did say that his government was ""willing if
needed, together with the international community, to be part of a mediation"" process to resolve the crisis. Some analysts say Beijing is using this
conflict to achieve geopolitical advantage and point to the economic lifeline
it's now offering Russia to keep Putin afloat, while blaming the US for
the war. Asked about sanctions by a Russian reporter, Wang said China and Russia jointly opposed ""attempts to revive a cold war
mindset"". For the Chinese government to be part of any
solution to the Ukraine war, it will also have to be a solution that is
approved by the Kremlin. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.9537282e-09
"The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel. The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was ""less freely"" traded compared to oil, and it would be ""much more difficult"" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports. In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be ""impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market"". ""It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,"" he said. Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation. ""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" he said. Could the world survive without Russian oil? Could EU weaponise energy in Russia crisis? Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, ""practically it is challenging"". He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine ""with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes"". ""The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,"" he told the BBC. ""The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow."" Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a ""completely different kettle of fish"". He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with ""vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off"" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil. EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution. The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted. Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight. And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war. Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat. Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (Â£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon. UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban. Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended. Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Average UK petrol prices have hit a record 155p a litre Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies. Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe. ""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

"Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday Ed Sheeran has told the High Court he does not ""borrow"" ideas from unknown songwriters without credit. The singer-songwriter has been accused by two other songwriters of copying parts of his 2017 hit Shape Of You. Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue's barrister suggested Sheeran treated lesser-known songwriters differently from famous ones. Sheeran denied this, telling the court he had cleared parts of songs with ""lots"" of unknown artists. Shape of You was number one for 14 weeks in the UK in 2017, becoming the best-selling song of the year around the world. Allow YouTube content?

On Friday, their barrister Andrew Sutcliffe QC claimed Sheeran ""borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won't"". But Sheeran denied the claim that he is a ""magpie"" who lifts other people's work without acknowledgment, pointing out that he has often shared credit with lesser-known artists, including Shivers and Visiting Hours, and a song that sampled an ""unknown composer's"" work from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. ""All those examples are not famous artists that we've cleared songs with and that's what I have to say on that,"" he told the court. Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch Sheeran created Shape of You with co-writers Steve Mac - real name Steven McCutcheon - and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, both of whom were also in court. After its release,Sheeran added the team behind TLC's 1999 single No Scrubsto the song's writing credits after some commentators pointed out similarities. On Monday, Mr Sutcliffe told the star: ""The evidence is overwhelming that at the time of writing Shape of You, your songwriting process involved collecting ideas."" Sheeran replied: ""You say it's overwhelming, I don't agree with that."" In written evidence, the singer said the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He said: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it."" He added: ""I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write. ""I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Dressed in a sharp black suit, Ed Sheeran is firm, determined and just a little bit irritated on the stand as lawyers for Chokri and O'Donoghue deconstruct his songwriting process, looking for hints that he might take inspiration from outside sources. Sheeran testifies that he mostly works in collaboration with other writers, and that it's often hard to identify who has written each individual part of a song once it's finished. Referencing his Shape of You co-writer Johnny McDaid, he says: ""My and Johnny's writing partnership is very much like a game of tennis. He'll say something and I'll say something back. We're quite quick when we go back and forth."" Asked repeatedly whether he is responsible for the chorus to his 2015 song Photograph, Sheeran replies tersely: ""I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't know. We wrote the song together."" It's a phrase he returns to several times throughout the morning's questioning. Photograph is relevant because it was the subject of a separate copyright claim from Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, who wrote Matt Cardle's 2011 single Amazing. The duo were eventually given a share of the song's royalties and a Â£4m lump sum in an out-of-court settlement. Sheeran says he settled the claim because it was a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"". Asked why he would pay out such a ""substantial"" sum instead of taking the case to court, he says he did so on the advice of his lawyers. Mr Sutcliffe said Sheeran had known about Chokri before Shape Of You was written because the grime artist had tweeted Sheeran directly, and the singer had given a shout out to Sami Switch on stage in 2011. But Sheeran replied: ""This isn't stuff that's true."" Chokri had also appeared on YouTube channel SBTV at around the same time as Sheeran, who described its founder Jamal Edwards as his ""best friend"". But he said the music entrepreneur,who died last month, didn't share songs like Oh Why with him. Instead, the pair would ""talk about football, talk about his mum, talk about theatre"", he said. Sheeran was also asked about his role as a talent-spotter for his own label Gingerbread Man Records. He denied being aware of Oh Why, saying he had just signed Jamie Lawson to the label and ""wasn't looking for anyone else"" to work with. The musician told the court he quit social media in 2015, adding that for ""the whole of 2016"" he was ""off"" social media and was using a ""flip phone from Tesco"". In May 2018, Sheeran and his co-writers issued proceedings asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright. The pair then issued a counter claim for copyright infringement. The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks.

European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies. Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe. ""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

"Countries such as Yemen depend heavily on Russia and Ukraine for their wheat The head of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, has warned the conflict in Ukraine could send global food prices soaring, with a catastrophic impact on the world's poorest. Ukraine and Russia are both major exporters of basic foodstuffs, and the war has already hit crop production, driving up prices Mr Beasley said it was putting more people at risk of starvation worldwide. ""Just when you think hell on earth can't get any worse, it does,"" he said. Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally. Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices. Mr Beasley told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme that the number of people facing potential starvation worldwide had already risen from 80 million to 276 million in four years prior to Russia's invasion, due to what he calls a ""perfect storm"" of conflict, climate change and coronavirus. He said certain countries could be particularly affected by the current crisis, due to the high proportion of grains they currently import from the Black Sea region. David Beasley runs the World Food Programme ""The country of Lebanon, 50%, give or take, of their grains, come from Ukraine. Yemen, Syria, Tunisia - and I could go on and on - depend on the country of Ukraine as a breadbasket,"" he said. ""So you're going from being a breadbasket to now, literally, having to hand out bread to them. It's just an incredible reverse of reality."" Norwegian chemical company Yara International, a major fertiliser producer which operates in more than 60 countries, told the BBC a shortage could badly hit crop yields, leading to ""a global food crisis"". Ukrainian lawyer Ivanna Dorichenko, an expert in international trade arbitration, said some farmers in Ukraine have already abandoned their fields in order to take up arms against the Russian invasion. She told the BBC: ""The men who need to work on the land, they're all defending our land right now. Because if they do not defend the land, there'll be nothing to work on at a later stage, and you don't have a single person right now who's not trying to help in any way they can."" Ms Dorichenko said the war had wreaked havoc with supply lines typically used to export agricultural produce. Ukraine's military suspended all commercial shipping at its ports in the aftermath of the Russian invasion. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' Fears of UK food and fuel prices rising due to war ""The vessels cannot leave the waters, the vessels cannot get loaded. It's effectively a war zone. Sadly, there's nothing which can be potentially shipped right now from Ukraine."" She said it meant ""huge losses"" for businesses, but also humanitarian efforts, because Ukraine could no longer send goods to regions such as South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to groups such the World Food Programme. With food price inflation already at crisis point in some countries prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine, South African economist Wandile Sihlobo said he was worried about the potential consequences for grain-importing nations in Africa and beyond. Mr Sihlobo, chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, told the BBC that while steep price rises may be a problem in the short-term, shortages of essential crops could follow. ""Over time, depending on the length and the severity of this war, you could begin to see shortages of shipments that come to the African continent, and that could cause shortages. Particularly in the North African countries, and to an extent in East Africa."" He added: ""If you were to look at the global food price index, it was at multiple highs at the start of this year. This crisis already adds to that difficult environment for many consumers, particularly in the developing world."" On Monday, one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies, Yara International,warned the conflict could hit its industry, further affecting food prices. Fertiliser prices had already been rising due to soaring wholesale gas prices. Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow.
