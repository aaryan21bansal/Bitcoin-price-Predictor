"Paul Pogba has made 48 appearances in all competitions for Manchester United this season Manchester United are within their rights to pay agents multi-million pound sums as part of transfers, FA chairman Greg Clarke has said - but the sport needs a debate about the issue. Fifa boss Gianni Infantino has called for more transparency around transfers. World football's governing body is looking into Paul Pogba's world-record transfer from Juventus to Manchester United. It follows claims that Pogba's agent will earn Â£41m from the deal. ""If that's what they're [Manchester United] going to pay, that's what they're going to pay,"" Clarke told BBC Sport. ""They are accountable to their owners; they're accountable to their fans. ""How much should we pay for players? How much should go to agents as a commercial transaction? ""If football wants to change that and limit the amount of money that agents get we're going to have to sit down as a game, led by the professional game, the Premier League and the EFL and the clubs and talk about that. ""I just think picking on one transfer and demonising it is not that helpful. Knee-jerk reactions don't often yield good outcomes. What we want is some thought about how much money stays in the game so it can be invested in long-term productive things."" Man Utd signing of Pogba subject of Fifa inquiry 5 live: Pat Nevin on the dark side of football agents This video can not be played Stanley chairman on 'obscene' Pogba fees and the Premier League The money reportedly earnt by Pogba's agent this week prompted Accrington Stanley chairman Andy Holt to criticise Premier League clubs over the amount of money they spend, saying they were ""destroying the game"". In aninterview with BBC Sport,he added that their actions filter down to adversely affect clubs in the Football League, which he said was ""like a starving peasant begging for scraps"". The Premier League responded to his comments, saying: ""We will be writing to Mr Holt to ask him if he wishes the Premier League to continue the support we currently provide for his and other clubs in the EFL."" Gianni Infantino succeeded Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in February 2016 Fifa has written to the Premier League club ""to seek clarification on the deal"" that took Pogba from Juventus to Manchester United in August 2016. It is believed its inquiries centre on who was involved in the Â£89.3m transfer, and how much money was paid to them. A book published in Germany this week - The Football Leaks: The Dirty Business of Football - and reproduced in media reports includes what it claims is a breakdown of the Pogba fee and alleges his agent Mino Raiola earned Â£41m from the deal. When contacted by the BBC, Raiola declined to comment and said the matter was in the hands of his lawyers. Addressing the Fifa congress in Bahrain on Thursday, Infantino said: ""We have to look at transfer regulations, and everything that has to do with transfers, and increase transparency there as well - to discuss it with the players and with the clubs, to see how we can make all these transactions better. ""In the transfer window there is $3bn circulating around the world. It's a lot of money and we have to be transparent about these things."" This video can not be played Football agents: Are they worth Â£220m? Former Scotland international Pat Nevin appeared on BBC Radio 5 live sport on Wednesday and related an experience of his own from the time he was Motherwell chief executive to highlight the difficulties clubs can face with player agents. ""I was in a situation when I was chief executive at Motherwell and an agent came in and he was trying to give us a player, I think it was from Nigeria,"" said Nevin. ""I gave him the figure of what we were willing to pay for him - x per week, say Â£1,000 - and he said 'yeah, that plus my money will be whatever'. ""I told him we wouldn't pay him that - his player can pay it him. He ended up saying that if we gave [the player] Â£500 and him Â£500 then it is the same, Â£1,000. And I was thinking 'I hope you're never my agent'. ""He was immediately happy trashing the player and I'm thinking 'you absolute slimeball'. ""They don't say it in so many words but they give you a wink, a nod and a smile and if they know immediately you are not corruptible in that situation, you never hear from them again and you'll never get a player from them again."" One area of concern about transfers is the concept of third-party ownership (TPO) - when investors effectively own a share of a player. It has been alleged Fifa's interest in the Pogba transfer could be related to this issue - although that isvehemently denied,externalby Raiola. Fifa banned TPO in 2015, saying it had ""harmful effects"" on the sport, but some agents are thought to have found ways to bypass the regulations. These include buying shares in a club, and then taking a cut of any transfer fee that is subsequently received by the club for their player. Sam Allardycelost his jobas England manager last year when newspaper allegations surfaced which claimed he had offered advice on how to get around TPO rules. The Football Leaks: The Dirty Business of Football has highlighted other transfer deals which it has been claimed indicate potential TPO. One example is Roberto Firmino's move to Liverpool from Hoffenheim in 2015 which, it is alleged, saw the German club receive just Â£5.8m of a Â£29m transfer.

With 700m to go in the final race of 2016, the Briton was leading and on course to wrap up the world title. Exhausted, he began to weave over the road, was overtaken and collapsed afterbrother Alistair helped himover the line to finish second in Mexico. ""Last year was a bit of a rollercoaster,"" he told the BBC. ""It hurt me going in to this year, because you don't get many chances to become world champion and I messed it up. ""It made me very hungry to come in to the 2017 season to try and achieve that but so far this year, luck's not been on my side.""

He missed the first two races of this year's World Series - in Australia and United Arab Emirates - but is returning for the third in Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday. BBC Weather forecasts a comfortable18C for Yokohamaon raceday, but Brownlee is hoping extra heat training will pay off in the future, if not in Japan. ""Heat is obviously something that, as a pasty Yorkshireman, I'm not too good at. I know it's a weakness and after Cozumel one of the first things I did was ask a doctor how to solve this,"" he said. ""In October-November I went down to train with the British Navy in Portsmouth. One of the big things they taught me was to spend more time in hot and humid conditions. ""I've converted my conservatory in to a kind of heat chamber. Mine gets up to about 37C so I can sweat away in there on a turbo trainer and get used to Yokohama. ""Hopefully it's going to make a big difference because one thing I told myself after Cozumel was I'd be stupid if I didn't get used to the heat, or at least try and do something about it."" This video can not be played Jonny & Alistair Brownlee on dramatic end to World Triathlon Series Alistair, the elder of the Brownlee brothers, is focusing onlong-distance triathlons this yearand will not be competing in Japan. Jonny believes he will benefit from his brother's absence. ""In the past I've really enjoyed not having Alistair there. I've had my best races without him,"" he said. ""It puts more emphasis on me and I race more aggressively. Instead of looking over my shoulder and waiting for him to make those moves, it's up to me. ""But also in training as well, I've been able to do what suits me. I've tried to get my own little group around me. ""Hopefully, it'll come good in the next couple of years."" However, the next race in the World Series after Japan will be in Leeds, where Brownlee could be joined by his brother. In 2016, Alistair claimed victory with a dominant display in the pair's home city, withJonny second. ""All I can do now is try and do my best in all the other races and hopefully win in Yokohama and win in Leeds,"" said Jonny. ""Some of my best races have been when I'm just returning from injury, so hopefully I can do it again.""

"Conflict between humans and elephants is more intense in Sri Lanka than anywhere else in the world - 70 people are killed every year and more than 250 elephants die. Clashes are particularly frequent in areas that were abandoned for long periods during the country's lengthy civil war. Last June, six-year-old Sulojini and her father, Raja Thurai, were returning home from the river in the late afternoon sunshine.  Suddenly, an elephant appeared from the bush and attacked. ""The elephant lifted us with its trunk and threw us on the ground,"" remembers Thurai.  ""I lost consciousness, and when I woke up, my daughter was already dead."" The incident happened close to the Thurai's village, Paavatkodichchinai in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province, near paddy fields and in an area dotted with fruit bushes. ""I've lost two of my children - a son during the war, and Sulojini to an elephant,"" he says. Paavatkodichchinai is inhabited by Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, like many communities on the eastern part of the island. During the civil war, the presence of Tamil Tiger rebels made the Eastern Province a target for government forces, and when fighting was intense, local people fled. Raja Thurai and his family went to live in a refugee camp in 2007.  When they returned after the war, which came to an end in 2009, elephants had encroached on their land.  Now these huge mammals are a continual, terrifying presence - especially at night, when they roam around the village looking for food in fields and homes. ""We chase them away, but they come back again and again.  Every night we have to stay awake - last night also, I didn't sleep,"" Thurai, says. His family's home is one of many in the village that have suffered night attacks.  The house, shaded by two large mango trees, still has part of a wall missing - destroyed by an elephant one night just before Sulojini was killed. ""It happened at 02:00,"" says Indrani, Raja Thurai's wife.  ""The elephant trumpeted and ran towards the house, hitting the roof and wall."" Indrani holding Sulojini's flip-flops - iron sheets patch the damaged wall of the family home She says Sulojini was so frightened she developed a fever. The couple do not have a picture of the daughter they lost, but they have kept the small, pink flip-flops she was wearing when she died. Since then, the village has organised an informal neighbourhood watch scheme. Households have access to firecrackers to frighten the elephants away, but experts argue fireworks are not the answer. ""Communities get into a kind of arms race,"" says Dr Pruthu Fernando, a conservationist who has spent much of his professional life trying to mitigate human-elephant-conflict in Sri Lanka. ""If an elephant comes and tries to eat the crops, people shout at it.  So the elephant is scared and goes away.  Then the elephant realises people are only shouting, there's no harm to it.  So next time people shout, the elephant still comes and raids."" Villagers work through a series of deterrents: first they throw rocks at the animals, next they begin to light fires.  Finally, they use firecrackers. ""Some of those go off like a bomb,"" says Fernando.  ""But elephants soon realise they are only a lot of noise, so they still come and raid.  Ultimately, people end up shooting the elephant.  All of these things are confrontational."" Children bathe in a river alongside domesticated elephant, in Kataragama, southern Sri Lanka Fernando has pioneered the use of electrified fencing, erected at particular times of the year. Elephants are free to roam agricultural land during fallow periods, and farmers only put up the barriers when they plant their crops. ""The farmers take down the fence the day they harvest,"" he says. Sri Lanka already has 3,500km of electrified fencing aimed at containing elephants, but much of it is in the wrong place. Historically it has been used to mark boundaries - of private property and national parks.  But eventually, elephants destroy it.  Fencing has to be close to human activity to be effective, Fernando says. ""Fences work. If you maintain them well, elephants learn this is a no-go boundary.  They're also non-confrontational, so that leads to the possibility of better co-existence."" This video can not be played Rescuing orphaned elephants at the Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home Some Sri Lankans do live in harmony with wild elephants. The Rathugala Veddha community close to the Gal Oya National Park in south-eastern Sri Lanka - who trace their ancestry to some of the island's earliest inhabitants - chant, invoking God and the spirits, to protect them when they are in the forest.  No-one can remember a time when anyone was injured - let alone killed - by an elephant. ""We can sense when an elephant is close-by - we can feel it,"" says Poramal Aththo. ""We have that power in us."" It is possible he is describing the infrasound communication of elephants, and that villagers learned to sense this because they have been living in close proximity to the animals for so long. Poramal Aththo says he could teach other Sri Lankans how to stay safe, but it is an art - not something that can be learned in a day. On the other side of the human-elephant-conflict equation are babies like Leila.  She was rescued after eating ahukka patta- a primitive gunpowder bomb disguised as a fruity treat.  It blew up in her mouth, fracturing her jaw, and destroying half her tongue. Listen to Elephants, Politics and Sri Lanka on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents at 11:00 on Thursday 11 May - orcatch up on BBC iPlayer Radio The programme can also he heard onAssignmenton BBC World Service Leila is being treated at the Department of Wildlife Conservation's facility near the temple city of Polonnaruwa. ""The mortality rate of elephants eating hukka pattas is very high,"" says Dr Pinidiyage Manoj Akalanka, the vet on duty. ""Most of them will die.""  Death by hukka patta is cruel - unable to eat, the animal starves to death. In this district alone, they see around 40 cases a year.  Leila was injured by bullets too - something Akalanka says is becoming more common as farmers become desperate to defend their crops from marauding animals. But Leila is lucky - she has learnt to eat with half a tongue, and will eventually be released back into the wild. After Sulojini was killed by an elephant in Paavatkodichchinai, electricity was finally installed in the village. This makes possible a system of electrified fencing - although there is no sign the government or any other organisation will provide it any time soon. The government does pay 500,000 rupees ($3,278) to the families of those killed by elephants.  But there is no way to compensate a family for the loss of a little girl in pink flip-flops, who never returned home from her afternoon bathe.

"US President Donald Trump wants to be known for tax reform Students of 1930s economics are no strangers to the idea of 'priming the pump' - public spending to get the economy back on its feet. But US President Donald Trump appears to be laying claim to the phrase for himself. Inan interview with The Economist,externalpublished on Thursday, he used the metaphor to describe his hopes for tax reform. Then he asked: ""Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven't heard it. I mean, I justâ¦ I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It's what you have to do."" His claim immediately raised eyebrows. Or, as The New York Observerput it,external: ""The Entire Internet Is Trolling President Trump Over 'Priming the Pump."" Far from being a Trump-coined neologism, priming the pump has a long history in economic theory and was in widespread use by the 1930s. It's most often associated with John Maynard Keynes, the influential British economist who urged public spending to stimulate a weak economy. Newspapers alsomade the comparison,externalduring the presidency of Herbert Hoover, who was in office during the Wall Street Crash. John Maynard Keynes Early Thursday morning, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Twitter account struck back,noting,external: ""'Pump priming' has been used to refer to government investment expenditures since at least 1933."" The Oxford English Dictionary identifies the phrase used in a business context even earlier,quoting,externala 1916 edition of Everybody's Mag: ""When the waters of business are stagnant, gentlemen, it becomes necessary, if I may say so, to prime the pump."" The White House press office did not respond to an email seeking clarification on Mr Trump's comments. But even Mr Trump has a longer history with the expression. A non-exhaustive internet search revealed he used itin a speech,externalin December and in earlier interviews withTime,externalandThe New York Times,external.

"MarÃ­a Alvarez says she has been taking part in marches since 2002 Venezuelans angry with the government of President Nicolas Maduro have been taking to the streets almost daily since the beginning of April. Despite dozens of people being killed in protest-related violence, the demonstrations show little sign of abating. Here, demonstrators explain their reasons for protesting, and what they hope will come out of their efforts. There's no freedom of expression here in Venezuela. There's no freedom of any kind. On top of that you have shortages of medicines, of goods. This crisis is affecting my entire family. We have gone from being middle class to being much lower down. Every day we're worse off and our children don't have a future. They're killing our children [at the protests]. I'm here as a mother, not just for the sake of my own children but for the sake of all Venezuelan children and youths who are being unjustly repressed because this dictatorship wants to take over the country. What is behind the crisis? Venezuela sees sharp rise in child deaths A crumbling health system The government portrays the opposition as terrorists. We're really tired of this and that's why we'll keep protesting. There are people who think that just another march won't change anything but I don't think that's true. I believe that if all of us gathered here think that way, we can achieve something. I will continue marching as long as my health allows it.  I'm a breast cancer survivor - I've just come from my check-up and I'm fine, so I will carry on fighting for my children, for my country. ""La Muerte"" (alias meaning death) worries government agents will come looking for him if he shows his face I'm on my 32nd day of protest. I've been here every day, resisting. I've been unemployed for two months because of the situation this country is in. The firm I used to work for left Venezuela. I have two children. Now I do ""bachaqueo"" [buying and selling goods on the black market] to feed them. We're here to put an end to the dictatorship in Venezuela, so that our children can grow up in a free Venezuela. The people of Venezuela have been supporting us, they bring us food and water. They know we're not going to abandon them, we're the resistance of Caracas, we're the resistance of Venezuela. I carry a homemade shield on which I've painted the map of Venezuela. I wear a mask because the Sebin [Venezuelan intelligence service] is looking for us. The police come to search our homes and take us away if they find us. They've already taken some of my friends. A few friends have been killed. More than 30 people have been killed in 35 days of protests. And we're fighting for them. What drives me to protest is what's happened to my sister. She is like a mother to me because she looked after me while my parents, left-wing militants, were doing their thing. She is 38 and she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012. She was getting injections to keep it from growing. That medication was being produced here. Miguel Pizarro protests because medicine shortages affected his sister But in 2014 it stopped being produced in Venezuela and it soon stopped being imported, too. My sister's tumour started growing again and left her paralysed. In 2015, we decided as a family that we needed to get her out of the country. She's now living abroad in a tiny flat as an undocumented immigrant and we send her what we can so she can get the injections, which keep her paralysis in check. I don't want to continue living in a country where I can only see her on the screen of my phone because someone decided to siphon off the money needed to import medication. When I wake up tired of protesting, I remember that day I waved her and my niece off at the airport. You have to turn that pain into fuel, if you don't, it will turn into hate, pain will turn into a wish for revenge, and I'd rather it was a fuel for change. Alba FernÃ¡ndez Torres I've been to all the protests so far and I will carry on going to all of them. It's risky, but if we want freedom for my country and for the children of this country, we have to take some risks. My children, of course, worry about me but they agree with me. They say, ""Carry on mum, we will, too!"" Despite my age I feel the duty and the moral obligation to give the children a free Venezuela, which I knew when I was a student. I demand free elections to change this government that we don't want, this government that has erased the middle class from the map. I worked as an anaesthetist and as a doctor I can tell you the problems are numerous. We don't have supplies. When a patient is going to be operated on, the first thing he is given is a list of the medical supplies he needs to buy, no matter how much it costs, because the hospital has nothing. I have bladder cancer and I haven't been able to have my check-up, which was due in January, because there are no reagents. My diet has suffered, too - now I don't eat half as much of what I used to and it's mainly carbohydrates. Where is the protein to give us energy? I'm going to carry on protesting until that man [President Nicolas Maduro] leaves. I don't want violence, but we're going to get him out, of that I'm sure. Two masked protesters who prefer to be known by their collective alias, Los Pedros We're here to topple the government, one way or another. There are people dying of hunger, the currency has dropped in value, we can't buy basic goods and there's a lack of security, which is killing us. My granny can't get the medication she needs. And then, in January last year, my uncle was killed by criminals. That's when I decided to go out and protest, but I knew I wouldn't be allowed to on my own. We talked about it at school one day and decided to all take to the streets together. There are about 15 of us, all the same age, and we call ourselves Los Pedros. We don't have classes at the moment anyway because of the protests so we may as well come here. This is my fifth protest. Our parents know we're here. They do worry, but we're doing it for Venezuela. We saw what happened with the protests in Ukraine and we think it can work here. All photographs by Alejandro Cegarra.

"The leaked version of the Labour Party manifesto commits to ""take energy back into public ownership to deliver renewable energy, affordability for consumers, and democratic control"". Part of that would involve ""central government control of the natural monopolies of the transmission and distribution grids"". Natural monopolies are businesses where there are no benefits to be had from competition. They are usually areas where there is a lot of initial spending on infrastructure needed, such as train tracks or water pipes. It does not mean there can only be one business serving the whole country, but it makes no sense to have companies competing to provide such services to consumers in a particular area. It would be inefficient, for example, to have two taps in your sink offering water from different providers or two sockets in your wall with electricity from competing energy companies. Being a natural monopoly gives businesses enormous market power, which means that they must be regulated. Whether it is better to have such services provided by government or by private companies regulated by government is a matter of political opinion. National Grid's main business is moving electricity and gas round the country. This is known as transmission. The very last leg of the journey into people's homes and businesses - known as distribution - is done by a number of different companies. National Grid does own a stake in Cadent Gas, a distribution firm, but most gas distribution and all electricity distribution is controlled by other firms. The cost of transporting gas and electricity round the country accounts for 29% of the average dual-fuel (both gas and electricity) bill,according to Energy UK,external, up from 23% in 2010. But National Grid says its share of that - the transmission cost - is only 5% of the typical electricity bill, and 3% of a gas bill. The rest is distribution costs. Owning the transmission and distribution network would give the government considerably more control as it attempted to deliver promises in the leaked manifesto to deliver renewable energy and affordability for consumers, including keeping the average dual fuel bill below Â£1,000 a year. The leaked manifesto also pledges to banfracking(the use of high pressure liquids to extract gas from rocks) and usecarbon capture(stopping carbon dioxide from escaping with other waste gases) as it moves to cleaner fuels. Control over the network might help with this, but the government via its regulator and planning decisions already has a big say over the future energy mix. Just nationalising National Grid (which is worth about Â£38bn on the stock market at the moment) would not achieve what Labour is promising - it would give the government the company that owns the UK's electricity and gas transmission (it might also leave the government owning National Grid's energy business in the US). The distribution part of the equation is a slew of other companies - for gas alone it would be SGN, Northern Gas Networks, Wales and West Utilities, as well as Cadent Gas. Butthe leaked manifesto,externalcalls for control of these companies, which could possibly be achieved by buying stakes in these businesses rather than nationalising them. BBC business editorSimon Jack saysNational Grid's UK business is estimated to be worth about Â£25bn. ""A chunky purchase but one that could quite easily financed in that it makes enough money to repay the interest on any money borrowed to buy it."" National Grid has a lot of shareholders. It's been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1995. Its shareholders, including 880,000 small shareholders, would be very upset if they didn't get a good price from the government for their shares. There are not many precedents for nationalisation of profitable companies in the UK - companies are usually nationalised when they are in financial difficulties - so it is not clear at this stage what the process would be.

"Water, water everywhere - but when can you drink it for free? Most people do not know their rights to free drinking water from businesses and public buildings, a survey says. The Keep Britain Tidy poll says only 25% of the public know when they can ask for water for free - while 71% feel awkward asking for water from venues if they are not a customer. But even if they are buying something, more than a third feel awkward asking for their water bottle to be filled. The poll for the charity and Brita UK saw 2,119 people surveyed by YouGov. Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Allison Ogden-Newton said: ""This report demonstrates that the British public want greater access to tap water when out and about."" So when can you ask for a free glass of water, and when can't you? Some licensed premises might give you free water, but charge for the glass it comes in All licensed premises in England and Wales are required by law to provide ""free potable water"" to their customers upon request. In Scotland a similar law applies, but specifies ""tap water fit for drinking"". This means pubs, bars, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, takeaway food and drink outlets, cinemas, theatres, and even village and community halls - so long as they are authorised to serve alcohol. However, these premises can charge people for the use of a glass - or their service - when serving the ""free"" tap water. There is no law regarding the provision of drinking water in licensed premises in Northern Ireland. You may work up a sweat in a gym, but that doesn't mean you can get a drink of water for free Unlicensed premises in the UK do not have to legally supply free drinking water. So, provided they are unlicensed, this includes sports stadiums, leisure centres, swimming pools, health clubs, tourists attractions, theatres, cinemas and beauty salons. Schools must provide free drinking water by law - but not in Northern Ireland Schools are legally required to provide drinking water for pupils at all times in England, Scotland and Wales - but not Northern Ireland. However, there is guidance from the Public Health Agency stating that children in Northern Ireland ""must have easy access at all times to free, fresh, preferably chilled water"". All UK employers must provide free drinking water in the workplace for all their employees, at all times. Many people are not confident about drinking from a public fountain Of the people taking part in the poll, only 7% said they drink from water fountains or public taps - while 55% were concerned about the cleanliness of public water taps, fountains and dispensers. Just 11% said they would pop into a cafe or restaurant to ask for tap water. Keep Britain Tidy has issued recommendations aimed at improving the public's access to drinking water. These include: encouraging businesses to provide free drinking water to both customers and non-customers encouraging transport providers and hubs to improve access to free water raising public awareness of the cleanliness and quality of UK tap water.

"Men can work on practical projects of their own choosing in Men's Sheds across Scotland For some men, retirement is a long-awaited chance to travel the world, hit the golf course, or take up a new hobby. For others, after decades in work, it can be a time of loneliness and isolation. But across Scotland, a new movement is helping growing numbers of men improve their health and their mood. Men's Sheds have been set up across the country to enable men to come together to pursue practical interests like wood-turning and metalwork. Age Scotland said it was in contact with 101 sheds, ranging from established projects to new initiatives and some linked to other organisations. A new report by the charity outlines the impact the initiative has had on the lives of those who use the sheds. In The Shed Effect, men describe why they first turned to their local shed and how it has changed their lives. Roy Garland helps to run Carse of Gowrie & District Men's Shed Men are often referred to the shed by their wives, said Roy Garland of Carse of Gowrie & District Men's Shed. ""They say 'My husband just sits at home all day. I was wondering if I could bring him along to the shed to let him see what you do?' ""Needless to say, we always invite them along and it's surprising the amount of men that have been introduced to the shed by their wives."" Jack Ferguson retired after undergoing major heart surgery about nine years ago. When he couldn't go back to work, he said he was ""down for about a year"". He admits he was probably depressed but he was helped by Hamilton Men's Shed. He said: ""I don't know what the attraction was but, when I read about the men's shed I thought, 'I think it'd be good...just might be good', you know. ""But fae day one I was, 'Yes! This is it. This is what I want'."" Super shed's health benefits for men Tam Dagg took early retirement from his job in Jedburgh after 38 years with the same company. ""Then I was sitting around the house, semi-comatoseâ¦It was boring, you could say lonely if you can be lonely when you're married,"" he said. He learned about Hawick Men's Shed from his daughter and finally walked through the door last December. ""I was living in Hawick but I had no friends in Hawick. I had been working in Jedburgh for 38 years. Now I'm in the shed nearly every day."" Men with expertise in one trade can give advice to others with no experience Trevor Gallon, of The Jed Shed, in Jedburgh, said they share their skills and experience. He said: ""Men in the workshop will stand side by side and they'll be taught by somebody next to them who'll go, 'How about trying it this way? I'll do that little bit for you. You do this bit'. ""Quite often to be side by side with somebody, learning what it's all about or to be shown by somebody who's made one before and they're passing on a skill to you. ""Then, to me, that makes you feel a lot better. It gives you confidence. It gives you abilities that you maybe never had before. You're pushing past your own barriers a little bit."" Mike Fairweather, of Carse of Gowrie & District Men's Shed, said: ""I think o' things and I lie in bed at night and think o' things. 'What'll I do tomorrow?' ""So, I think o' things, and I come down and dae them...started a project maybe at the beginning of the year. I havenae finished it yet. ""I cut oot this tree trunk, eight inches wide and I sawed it through by hand, and then I drilled five holes in it, by hand, and it's gonna be a wine rack once it's finished. I've got to keep on the move. ""And I think that's the main thing for people my age, you know, or round about my age. If they've nothing to do, get yourself down here and keep movin'."" And John Ross, of Gala Men's Shed, helps other men with joinery work. ""I'm 73 now - so I've been working a long time, and it's always been with wood,"" he said. ""My father had a joiner's business, and my grandfather had the business before that, so it just goes on and on. My brother was a joiner, and my two nephews, they're joiners. ""I get a lot from helping the guys, just seeing them develop, you know, like when they're making something, all of a sudden there's a kinda look on their face and you can see they're enjoying this, and getting a lot from it."" Men can pick up new skills like wood turning David Waterton said the informality of the project helps make The Jed Shed work. ""You can come when you want to come, you know,"" he said.  ""There's no pressure on anybody to come all the time if you've got a day when you don't feel like it, or you've got something else on. ""Making it more formal would take a lot away from it. I think the informal thing, a lot of the time, is what the guys like. ""That older member is in most days. He just pops in for a cup of tea and a chat with some of the guys he knows and then just goes away again, or sometimes he'll pop upstairs and just hang about for an hour."" And according to Geoff Allison, of Dalbeattie Men's Shed, the men all have one thing in common. ""We're guys plootering about in a shed, but we're just doing it somewhere larger scale,"" he said. ""That's what it's about. We're doing 'men things'. We all have CTAS - Compulsive Tool Acquisition Syndrome!"" For some, it could even be a life-saver. Joe Scott was in the ""doldrums"" when he had to take early retirement after suffering a stroke. He felt like he was a ""waste of time"" and he would be ""better off out of the road"", but the Gala Men's Shed turned his life around, he said. ""Aye it's probably saved my life, or at least my sanity,"" he said.

"Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy This week, Senator Larissa Waters became the first Australian politician to breastfeed in parliament. But can women really breastfeed at work? Dr BJ Epstein, a senior lecturer at the University of East Anglia, started bringing her daughter Esther to her office when she was 14 months old. ""Initially, I was really stressed about returning to work, as breastfeeding was an important part of our relationship,"" she says. ""But luckily I have been really well supported. She comes with me to work three days a week before nursery and breastfeeds - but I do have a private office. ""I am aware my situation is quite unusual. It's been nothing but a positive experience."" But does it interfere with BJ's work? ""I don't find it distracting having my daughter in my office,"" she says. ""She sits on my lap and breastfeeds while I work, or she draws, or plays with toys, and I get a lot done. ""I actually get more done with her here than I do later in the day. More people knock on my door later in the day!"" Dr BJ Epstein (right) and her wife Fi Esther, who is now two and a half, also travels with her mum to academic conferences, allowing BJ to breastfeed her daughter before and after her talks - although not during. ""Again, I know I'm lucky that my wife is a bit flexible (she works part-time) and can come with me,"" says BJ. ""I think having a child and being able to breastfeed her at work and in work situations has made me a better employee. ""It's a clichÃ©, but I feel I know what's important now, and I know how to prioritise."" Your stories: Breastfeeding toddlers Are breastfed babies more intelligent? While BJ's situation is rare, it's more common for women who work near home or nursery to breastfeed their child during a break. But one woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, found she had to battle her employer to be allowed to do this. ""I had chosen to feed my youngest rather than express at work during my allotted break,"" she says. ""I was given some grief about it. I was told that I couldn't feed him on the premises and my break was set aside to express and express only. ""It ended up being resolved once I contacted my HR department, and I was allowed to have him on site to feed him during that break for about three months. ""I had to explain that feeding a baby is quicker and more efficient than expressing so was better for everyone's interests."" Bringing your baby to work is not common, but many new mothers do need to be able to express and store their breast milk in the office. Employers in the UK are not explicitly obliged by law to accommodate women who are breastfeeding, unlike - for example - the United States. There,businesses must give women reasonable time off,externalto express milk, as well as providing facilities. The charity Maternity Action has released a manifesto ahead of the UK general election asking for the next government to introduce a full legal right to breastfeed in the workplace. Rosalind Bragg, director of Maternity Action, says: ""It's very disappointing this hasn't been addressed. It's important for all women to have the choice about how they breastfeed their babies."" Currently, the only requirement for employers is to conduct a risk assessment if a mother gives them written notification that she is breastfeeding. The employer must consider the risks and ""take reasonable action"" - including, for example,adjusting the hours of work,external. The Health and Safety Executive provides a list of recommendations of support employers should provide. Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills at the Institute of Directors, says companies are starting to recognise the advantages of having flexible attitudes. ""Adjusting workplaces for mothers has clear business benefits - increasing loyalty among female staff and consequently reducing recruitment and training costs for employers,"" he says. ""Where possible, employers should have a policy to support breastfeeding.""

"The Bank of England moved into caution mode today. After two major upgrades to its growth forecasts since the referendum - in November and February - today saw a slight downward revision. But it is not time to race for the lifeboats. The Bank said business investment was stronger than expected and that growth next year and in 2019 was likely to be slightly higher than previously forecast - although still significantly below 2%. A prediction, it said pointedly, ""conditioned on the assumptions that the adjustment to the United Kingdom's new relationship with the European Union is smooth"". Which it might not be. For this year there are some major negative trends. Consumers have started to feel the effects of inflation and there has been a ""slowing in real household spending growth"". Wage growth is also ""notably weaker than expected"" and is set to be below inflation this year - meaning that real incomes are falling. The incomes squeeze - felt so widely after the financial crisis - is back. Businesses are still nervous about the future - and what they may invest in salaries - and there is enough slack in the labour market to make inflationary wage demands difficult. At the same time, the Bank upgraded its inflation forecast, saying it could now hit 2.8% as the effects of the fall in the value of sterling wash through an economy that imports 40% of its food and fuel. So, a tough 2017. But the Bank's take on the temperature of the economy is more than a one year analysis. And over the three year forecast period, it is more bullish. Sterling has strengthened this year after its precipitate fall following the Brexit vote. The European - and indeed global - economy is stronger than expected, important for a trading nation like the UK. Wage growth will strengthen, it says, as the employment market tightens. Inflation risk will dissipate as the effects of sterling's decline falls out of the data. The incomes squeeze will reverse. This is a carefully worded Inflation Report, drafted, of course, in the middle of an election campaign. It is cautious in the short term, with the Bank indicating privately that 2017, when it comes to that key issue of wage growth, could be ""the worst of it"". There is a sting in the tail. Earlier this year the markets judged that the chances of an interest rate rise were so low there was only likely to be one increase over the next three years. Today the Bank was certainly more hawkish, saying that monetary policy ""could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent"" than markets believed. That is not to say there is likely to be an interest rate hike any time soon. But, if the Bank's more positive outlook towards the end of the three year forecast period comes to pass, the Monetary Policy Committee could move more rapidly towards interest rate rises than some expect.

"Leftfield in 1995: Paul Daley (left) and Neil Barnes When Leftfield released their debut album in 1995, it changed dance music forever. Wilfully eclectic, Leftism never settled on a single genre, dabbling in tribal, trance, dub, house and ambient music. The quality never dipped, proving that a long-form dance record - one that worked as a coherent suite of music rather than a collection of 12-inch singles - was possible. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside releases by The Chemical Brothers, Underworld and The Prodigy. The duo behind Leftfield, Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, had started out in punk bands, and retained the ethos that ""music that takes from other places but moves on"". To that end, they borrowed from Afrobeat, indie and punk itself - even cajoling former Sex Pistol John Lydon into singing the album's breakout single Open Up. These days Barnes continues to record and perform as Leftfield (with Daley's blessing) and, starting on Thursday, he embarks on a UK tour in which Leftism will be played in full for the first time. The project was initially planned for the record's 20th anniversary, but is only coming to fruition now, in its 22nd year. Ahead of the tour dates, Barnes and Daley chatted to the BBC about the making of Leftism, its impact, and their ear-splitting live shows. The artwork featured no photographs or logos, focusing instead on a loudspeaker What do you remember about the making of Leftism? Paul Daley:Lots of late nights on the computer, synths and samplers in the week and then I was off DJing at the weekends. It was all very fast moving and constantly evolving, much like the scene at the time. Neil Barnes:A lot of stuff was done on the fly. We were just being creative in the studio. We weren't completely into indie, we weren't completely into techno. We'd get bored and think, 'We've done a [dance] track, now let's do something down-tempo, or a hip-hop track.' Is that why it still sounds fresh today? NB:I think the thing about the album is that it takes you on a journey through electronic music. There isn't one style. It's unusual in that, I think. PD:I wanted the album to sound exotic, have its own identity and have its own place amongst everything else around at the time. That time was great for music in the UK and as time goes by the '90s, and what happened creatively, is only now coming into focus and I'm really chuffed what we did is considered as something special. Leftism is frequently cited as a breakthrough, in that it showed dance music could work in an album format. Was that your intention? PD:It had to be more than a collection of instrumental formula dance records but I didn't really know it worked until I was editing it together at the end. It was a calculated risk at the time but not really intentional. Happy accidents, and all that. What's the most unusual instrument on the album? NB:There's a berimbau at the start of Afro Left. It's probably the oldest instrument, aside from hitting a drum, in the world. It's a stringed instrument from Brazil, and they hit it with a pebble. I'll be bringing it on the tour with me. The berimbau is instantly recognisable in the opening bars of Afro Left John Lydon has called Open Up one of his favourite lyrics. Did you realise it was special at the time? NB:I think it's one of the best songs he ever wrote. When he came in and did the vocal, we realised we had to get the rest of the backing track up to the standard of the lyric. His vocal performance was so incredible, we felt we needed to match it. We changed the bassline radically and added a lot more drums. Your live shows got a reputation for being louder than Concorde. How bad was it? NB:The speakers were so loud your eyeballs would vibrate. Did you really make plaster fall off the roof of Brixton Academy? NB:A whole bit of the ceiling came down, not just a few chunks. You could see it all over the dancefloor. I've seen worse, though. We once shook a metal grating off when we played a soundcheck in a university. It came down and hit the floor. If anyone had been near it, they'd have been dead. I was terrified. And we brought a whole bar down in Amsterdam. When our sound man fired up the system, it all came down. Bottles, glasses, everything, flying off the wall. Who paid for it? I have no idea. Neil Barnes says the Leftism tour is the band's most ambitious yet What made you decide to revisit the album now? NB:It just seems like a good time to say ""bon voyage"" to Leftism. I'm not really going to be playing these songs much more. How hard has it been to recreate the record for the tour? NB:It's an unbelievable job of forensic investigation. It's taken months. The album didn't go onto tape at the time, so we've gone back to the raw files to find stuff and build the sounds up so it sounds like the album. Is the concert a faithful rendition of the album? NB:It is, but all the tracks are expanded. Some of them are 12 minutes long now. Like Release The Pressure, I've incorporated the single [mix] into the album version, so you get a bit of Cheshire Cat's vocals. And there's no encore. 20th Century Poem was always going to be the closer. Barnes will continue to record music as Leftfield, following 2015's Alternative Light Source album Paul, do you miss playing live? Will you go to see the shows? PD:I don't really miss anything as I find ""missing"" things can be negative. I have great memories and still get a buzz from DJing which, in my eyes, is and always has been a performance and artform. People come up to me and shake my hand for what I did in Leftfield between 1989 and 2002 and that's enough for me. Finally, what do you see as Leftism's legacy? Who are your direct descendants? PD:Anyone who's thought, ""I'm going to buy some decks, synths, samplers and make a record"" since 1989. Also anyone who has thought, ""I can make a record in my bedroom today and play it in my DJ set at the weekend"". That was the revolution that has had a massive impact on musical history and which we were part of and it just seems to roll on and get handed down to the next generation for them to put their own stamp on it. By no means are Leftfield wholly responsible - but we were part of a forward-thinking global musical movement that exploded at the end of the 20th Century and turned pop culture on it's head. Leftism 22 is out now on Sony. Leftfield tour the album around the UK for the rest of the month, starting in Bristol on Thursday 11, May.

"I am something of an insomniac and I know that when I don't get at least seven hours' sleep I become tired and irritable. I've also noticed that a bad night's sleep affects my memory. The link between sleep and memory has been around for a long time and one plausible theory is that during deep sleep your brain moves short-term memories, collected that day, into long-term storage, freeing up space in your brain for more memories. So if you don't get enough deep sleep those memories will be lost. Whether this theory is right or not, getting a good night's sleep (rather than staying up late and cramming) is particularly important for students who are currently revising for exams. But what really surprised me, while making the Truth about Sleep for BBC One, was discovering how much a bad night's sleep can affect blood sugar control and hunger, even in healthy volunteers. To find out more we asked Dr Eleanor Scott, who works at the University of Leeds, to help us. We recruited a group of healthy volunteers and, under her supervision, fitted them with activity monitors and continuous glucose monitors, so we could see what was happening to their blood sugar levels, every five minutes or so. Then we asked our volunteers to sleep normally for two nights (so we had a baseline), have two nights where they went to bed three hours later than normal, followed by two nights where they could sleep as long as they liked. Naturally enough, being an avid self-experimenter, I joined in. Staying awake when you really don't want to, and everyone else in your house has gone to bed, was not enjoyable. I was also unpleasantly surprised by just how much my blood sugar levels rose on the days when I was sleep deprived, and how hungry that made me. The same was true of my fellow volunteers. When we met to get our results from Dr Scott everyone complained about having the munchies. As one volunteer put it, ""I wanted lots of biscuits and I didn't just have one.  I'd go for 10. I wrote it down on my diary - 10 custard creams"" ""Is that unusual?"" I asked him. ""Well that certainly unusual for breakfast!"" he replied. All of us, whether we had feasted on biscuits or managed to stick to our normal diet, saw marked increases in our blood sugar levels, to the point where some previously healthy individuals had levels you might expect to see in borderline type 2 diabetics. These problems resolved after a couple of good nights' sleep. As Dr Scott pointed out, there is now a lot of evidence from big studies which suggests that people who sleep for less than seven hours a night are more likely to become obese and also develop type 2 diabetes. So why does this happen? Dr Scott said: ""We know that when you are sleep-deprived this alters your appetite hormones, making you more likely to feel hungry and less likely to feel full. We also know that when people are sleep-deprived they often crave sweet foods, which could explain the custard cream cravings. ""Also, if you're awake when you're not meant to be, you produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol, and that can influence your glucose level, as well, the next day"" A recent meta-analysis, carried out by researchers at King's College London, found that sleep-deprived people consume, on average, an extra 385 kcal per day, which over time could certainly add up. It's not just that your blood sugar levels soar and your hunger hormones go into overdrive when you are sleep-restricted. Researchers have also found that areas of your brain associated with reward also become more active when you're tired. In other words you become more motivated to seek out food. Getting enough sleep is particularly important, not just for adults but also for children. In another recent study researchers took a small group of pre-school children, aged three-to-four, all regular afternoon nappers, and not only deprived them of their afternoon nap but also kept them up for about two hours past their normal bedtime. The following day the children ate 20% more calories than usual, particularly more sugar and carbohydrates. They were then allowed to sleep as much as they wanted. The following day they still consumed 14 per cent more calories than normal. All of which points to the importance of getting a good night's sleep. A few weeks ago, we kicked off theBBC Sleep Challenge,externaland 367 of you chose to test out options to help you sleep and report back. This was not a proper scientific survey, because it was self-selecting, but it was revealing nonetheless. Of those taking the Sleep Challenge, the most common complaint was waking up in the night (half), followed by difficulty falling asleep in first place (a quarter). The most popular option was the controlled breathing technique which 146 people tried. The results were fairly evenly spread, with around 50 people choosing to cut out alcohol; do morning exercise; take a warm bath or avoid social media at least an hour before bedtime. The least popular option was eating two kiwi fruit before bed, which only attracted 27 people. It was also the option that people who did it found the least effective - only a third said it helped, some said it made their sleep worse! The other options produced surprisingly similar results, with around half of each group saying they had got benefit from doing the technique they'd chosen, while half did not. It appears the techniques with the most science behind them were the most effective, but clearly nothing works for everyone. So shop around and see what works for you. I now do most of them (I enjoy kiwi, just not every evening, and I prefer an evening shower to a bath). I've also committed myself to eating more fibre, which was not on our original list because we thought the effect would be too slow to show up. I'm not entirely sure which is the 'best' but the combination has certainly helped me get a better night's sleep.

"President Gianni Infantino was addressing the 67th Fifa congress in the Bahraini capital Manama Critics of world football's governing body are spreading ""fake news"" and taking part in ""Fifa bashing"", says president Gianni Infantino. Fifa's decision this week not to reappoint ethics chiefs Hans-Joachim Eckert and Cornel Borbely meansan end to the reform process,the pair said. Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter is servinga six-year banfrom football for ethics breaches. ""We took over the organisation at its deepest point,"" said Infantino. ""We are rebuilding Fifa's reputation after all that happened."" Infantino, 47,took over as Fifa president in January 2016after the 81-year-old Blatter's 17-year reign ended ina corruption scandal. Chief investigator Borbely and ethics adjudicator Eckert said""hundreds"" of cases of alleged wrongdoing- some involving senior officials - were being looked into by Fifa's ethics committee before they were ousted. In response to their claims, Fifa released a statement on Wednesday, saying it wanted to ""better reflect the geographic and gender diversity that must be a part of an international organisation like Fifa"". ""There are a lot of fake news and alternative facts about Fifa circulating,"" said Infantino, speaking before the Fifa congress in Bahrain. ""Fifa bashing has become a national sport in some countries. It was right but Fifa has changed now."" Last month,high-ranking Fifa official Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabahresigned a day after denying claims linking him to a fraud case. He denies any wrongdoing. Infantino said the ""new Fifa"" under his leadership was a ""transparent organisation"" that was not ""fiddling around"". He added: ""If there is anyone who still thinks that he can enrich himself and he can abuse football, I have one plea for them - leave football now. We don't want you."" The governing body made a commitment to reform in 2011 aftercorruption allegations,only for a deeper scandal to emerge in 2015 that sawarrests and a raidat a hotel in Zurich as well asa large-scale investigation by US authorities. Blatter and former Uefa boss Michel Platini were both banned after the former Fifa boss was found to have made a Â£1.3m ""disloyal payment"" to the Frenchman. Both men deny any wrongdoing. French prosecutors are alsoinvestigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cupsand have questioned Blatter. Infantino was critical of governance experts who had been ""paid millions"" by Fifa to help reform the organisation, and claimed they had ""rubber-stamped a sick and wrong system"". He asked: ""Where were all these self-proclaimed gurus and experts? They all miserably failed. We will not accept good governance lessons from any individuals who miserably failed to protect football."" The former Uefa general secretary also offered ""a big thanks"" to authorities who had prosecuted officials involved in football corruption, saying they could ""count on"" Fifa's help. However, ex-Fifa presidential candidatePrince Aliof Jordan said he believes nothing has changed under Infantino. ""This is the kind of congress that we have seen before,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The system, the way business is conducted, it is the same. I don't see the refreshing change, the openness, the transparency that everybody talks about taking effect on the ground. ""I feel a sense of responsibility to speak up when I see that things are not going right or when things are blatantly wrong. We can't keep saying the same thing."" The need to boost women's football - he added that Fifa was looking at the creation of a 'world league' for the women's game, without giving further details Fifa's fight against racism, match-fixing and doping Fifa's finances - which he said were ""extremely solid"" after recent reports of major losses A charity match to be held between an England Legends and a World Legends team at Wembley when London hosts the Fifa Best Awards on 23 October Transfer regulationsand agent fees The Fifa congress also voted overwhelmingly to fast-track the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup, which will be the first tournament expanded to feature48 teams. The winner will be announced in June 2018 at the governing body's annual meeting, which is due to take place in Moscow. A joint submission from the US, Canada and Mexicoremains the only declared bid, but a three-month window has now started for other nations to submit expressions of interest. However, Europe and Asia are blocked under Fifa's rules from bidding because they will host the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament respectively. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Oceania lacks the interest and capability to host an expanded 48-team tournament and South America has already given its support to its northerly neighbours. That leaves Africa. There are rumours of a potential bid by Morocco. However, that has not yet materialised and given the burden of having to stage 80 games it would be likely to require other adjoining countries to join them. Such a bid would need huge infrastructure and stadium investment. Simply put, today's vote leaves US, Canada and Mexico in pole position to be awarded the tournament in one year's time.

"Michael Foot and Jeremy Corbyn - Labour leaders from different eras Labour's draft general election manifesto has been compared by some with the party's 1983 manifesto - how do the two documents measure up? The 1983 manifesto was written at a time of economic turmoil, mass unemployment and Cold War tensions and is arguably more ambitious in its scope. It is certainly framed in more forceful language. ""Within days of taking office, Labour will begin to implement an emergency programme of action, to bring about a complete change of direction for Britain,"" it says. ""Our priority will be to create jobs and give a new urgency to the struggle for peace. In many cases we will be able to act immediately."" Labour's draft election manifesto leaked At-a-glance: Labour's draft manifesto In full - Leaked manifesto,external Labour's 1983 manifesto,external They are very different documents in many ways, written to reflect the concerns of their respective times. Jeremy Corbyn's draft manifesto uses a more measured tone, talking about ""delivering a fairer, more prosperous society for the many, not just the few"". There is no mention of socialism, in contrast to the nine mentions it gets in 1983. But at the 2017 manifesto's heart is the same commitment to using government intervention and public money to boost industrial development and create jobs. In 1983, Labour leader Michael Foot had a five year ""emergency programme"" to rebuild industry and end mass unemployment. In 2017, Jeremy Corbyn proposes a ""a ten-year national investment plan to upgrade Britain's economy"". This video can not be played Labour propose massive public investment, withdrawal from the EEC and nuclear disarmament in their manifesto for the 1983 general election Both manifestos propose higher taxes on the rich and a crack down on tax avoidance. In 1983, Labour said: ""We shall reform taxation so that the rich pay their full share and the tax burden on the lower paid is reduced."" In 2017, Labour says ""only the highest 5% of earners will be asked to contribute more in tax to help fund our public services"". The 1983 manifesto goes further, proposing ""a new annual tax on net personal wealth"" to ""ensure that the richest 100,000 of the population make a fair and proper contribution to tax revenue"". Both manifestos include plans for a National Investment Bank to boost industrial development and support research and development. The 2017 version would allow the government to use public money to support long-term, higher-risk investment that the bank's are reluctant to touch. The 1983 version of the National Investment Bank is more interventionist. It proposes drawing up development plans with ""all leading companies - national and multinational, public and private"". Like the 2017 plan, it would provide access to credit, but a Labour government would have the power to ""invest in individual companies, to purchase them outright or to assume temporary control"". The 1983 manifesto also includes a commitment to reintroducing exchange controls, scrapped by the Conservatives in 1979, to ""counter currency speculation"" and stop capital ""flowing overseas"". In 1983, Labour was committed to scrapping Britain's nuclear weapons, saying ""we are the only party that offers a non-nuclear defence policy."" In 2017, Labour says it supports ""the renewal of the Trident submarine system"". But, in a possible nod to Jeremy Corbyn's longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons, it adds ""any prime minister should be extremely cautious about ordering the use of weapons of mass destruction which would result in the indiscriminate killing of millions of innocent civilians"". Both manifestos stress the need for Britain to work for nuclear disarmament through international bodies. Although the 2017 draft manifesto backs Britain's exit from the EU, following last year's referendum result, it is less Eurosceptic in tone than the 1983 document. It praises the EU for protecting workers' rights and the environment and vows to fight to keep them in Brexit negotiations. The 1983 manifesto says European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, ""was never devised to suit us, and our experience as a member of it has made it more difficult for us to deal with our economic and industrial problems"". Labour promised to begin withdrawal from the EEC without a referendum if it won power. The 1983 manifesto pledges to renationalise the industries privatised by the Thatcher government. The 2017 manifesto includes plans to renationalise the Royal Mail and the railways - which were still state-owned in 1983 - and part-nationalise the energy industry. Labour would also ""take control"" of the National Grid if it won power. The trade unions play a more central role in Labour's 1983 plans for the economy, reflecting the greater power they had at that time. The 2017 manifesto includes plans to restore some of that power by repealing the 2016 Trade Union Act and bringing back collective pay bargaining to some sectors. A Ministry of Labour would be introduced to oversee increased unionisation across the workforce. Both manifestos include plans to build more council houses and offer more protections to private renters. They also include plans to help more people buy their own homes and crack down on leasehold abuses. Jeremy Corbyn would also halt the sale of social housing, in an echo of the 1983 manifesto's pledge to end council house sales. Labour's 2017 manifesto includes plans to cap energy prices. In 1983, the party would have gone much further. It proposed ""a new Price Commission to investigate companies, monitor price increases and order price freezes and reductions. These controls will be closely linked to our industrial planning, through agreed development plans with the leading, price-setting firms"". It would ""take full account of these measures in the national economic assessment, to be agreed each year with the trade unions"". Increased spending on the NHS is a key priority in both the 1983 and the 2017 manifestos. In 1983, Labour pledged to ""increase health service expenditure by 3% per annum in real terms"". In 2017, Labour is promising to spend an extra Â£6bn to be paid for tax increases on higher earners. Labour's 2017 manifesto vows to ""reverse"" privatisation of the NHS. In 1983, the party promised to curb the expansion of private health care and ""take into the NHS those parts of the profit-making private sector which can be put to good use"". ""We will not allow the development of a two-tier health service, where the rich can jump the queue,"" the 1983 manifesto adds. Both manifestos include a commitment to cut class sizes to below 30, although the 1983 manifesto pledges this for all schools, while the 2017 version says it will initially be for ""all 5, 6, and 7 year olds"", with the rest to follow ""as resources allow"". Jeremy Corbyn is also pledging to introduce free school meals for all primary school children, paid for by removing the VAT exemption on private school fees. The 1983 manifesto includes plans to charge VAT on private school fees and promises to ""re-establish the school meals and milk services, cut back by the Tories"". It describes private schools as a ""major obstacle to a free and fair education system"" and promises to end their charitable status and ""integrate"" them into the local authority sector ""where necessary"". It also rejects the ""Tory proposals for student loans,"" a policy echoed in Jeremy Corbyn's pledge to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for low-income students. The 1983 manifesto also pledges to scrap corporal punishment - the beating of children with canes or straps - in schools. The Conservatives outlawed this in state schools three years later. Net migration to the UK - the difference between the numbers coming to live in the country and those leaving - was 17,000 in 1983 - a fraction of what it is today. In 1983, Labour said it accepted the need for immigration controls but vowed to scrap Conservative laws restricting the rights of Commonwealth citizens to remain in the UK and replace them with ""a citizenship law that does not discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons"". In 2017, Labour says it would scrap the Conservative target of reducing net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" and instead make  a positive case for ""controlled"" migration to boost the economy. It would bring in laws to stop companies undercutting wages with migrant workers or recruiting workers solely from abroad. The internet may have been a distant dream in 1983, but then, just as now, broadband was a major preoccupation for Labour politicians, it seems. The 1983 manifesto envisages a ""national, broadband network"" to carry a ""wide range of new telecommunications services"" and ""greater variety in the provision of television"". But, it adds, this important new system must be ""under firm public control"", with the job of building it handed exclusively to ""publicly-owned British Telecommunications"". Thirty four years later, the Labour manifesto includes a whole raft of broadband promises, including ""universal superfast broadband availability by 2022"", although there are no plans to renationalise BT to deliver it.

"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did not attend the planned unveiling of the party's 2017 general election poster A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees. The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday. Labour manifesto draft leaked Labour's draft manifesto at-a-glance The draft Labour manifesto (Pdf),external BBC correspondents unpick the policy pledges set out in the draft manifesto. Renationalising actually happens from time to time anyway. The East Coast Main Line spent several years in public ownership after it was handed back to the government by National Express in 2009, before being privatised again in 2015. It performed pretty well in public hands. It paid nearly Â£1bn in fees to the government and still managed to make a profit for the Treasury, while carrying more passengers and getting good passenger satisfaction scores. So there is some evidence that repeating that exercise each time a current rail franchise expires could work. Virgin Trains East Coast operates services between London, the north-east of England and Scotland However, other pledges like freezing rail fares, extending free wi-fi, ending driver-only operated trains and improving disabled access would freeze income while increasing costs. It might be harder to replicate the relative success of the East Coast Main Line experiment with these additional pressures. The track is already quasi-nationalised through Network Rail and the government pays subsidies to the train operating companies of more than Â£3bn a year. Of all the privatisations since Mrs Thatcher's time, this is probably considered one of the least effective in financial terms for the government. The question is whether passengers' memories of British Rail are clear enough to make a comparison to their experience today. The reference to price caps is hardly a surprise given a version of the policy was in the last Labour manifesto and the Conservative Party has committed to do much the same. The same criticisms over deterring investment and encouraging the withdrawal of cheaper prices for switchers apply to both parties. The setting up of publicly-owned utilities in every region of the UK is a much more difficult exercise. Apart from three locally run public companies, the government would essentially be starting from scratch in an industry that it hasn't been involved in for decades. The cost of transporting gas and electricity across cables and through pipes makes up nearly a quarter of consumers' energy bills Quizzed on Thursday morning about how this would work, the policy chief talked of setting up regional co-operatives, but where they would spring from and how they would be managed is not clear. The cost of transporting gas and electricity across cables and through pipes makes up nearly a quarter of consumers' energy bills. Most of that money goes to privately-owned National Grid, which last year made a profit of Â£3bn, although it no longer owns all of the UK gas transportation infrastructure. It also distributes gas and electricity in the United States and makes a much bigger profit margin here than it does there - a fact that has drawn heavy criticism from consumer groups. Even if you agree that National Grid is charging the energy companies too much, to nationalise it you would presumably have to buy it back. Its current value is Â£38bn, but a lot of that is made up of its US business which presumably a Labour government wouldn't want to buy! The UK business is estimated to be worth about Â£25bn. A chunky purchase, but one that could quite easily be financed in that it makes enough money to repay the interest on any money borrowed to buy it. Read more from Simon Jack on the manifesto Scrapping tuition fees is the biggest headline for education policy in Labour's leaked plans. Instead of fees rising to Â£9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. Tuition fees have proved a thorny issue for Labour It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to Â£6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. There are no details so far of how the cost would be covered, whether through general taxation or a targeted graduate tax. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, it would cost a ballpark figure of about Â£11bn per year to replace the cost of fees. But once the write-off from unpaid loans is taken into account, the cost would be about Â£8bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the IFS says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further Â£500m per year. There have been precedents for getting rid of tuition fees in other countries. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and New York State is making tuition free for families earning up to about Â£100,000 per year. But with promises already announced for big spending increases for schools, the university challenge for Labour - its starter for No 10 - will be about funding. Read more from Sean Coughlan Labour has already set out some of its NHS plans, including pay rises for staff in England above the current 1% pay cap. Every one percentage point increase above that will cost Â£500m and Labour said that would be paid for by increases in corporation tax. Other parties argued Labour was already spending the corporation tax receipts several times over. The draft manifesto includes a Â£6bn annual increase in NHS funding, though it is not clear when this would be achieved, or whether it includes the amount passed on to the devolved administrations. The funding will come, Labour says, from raising income tax for high earners. The annual health budget in England is around Â£115bn, so on the face of it a Â£6bn increase is significant. But the Conservatives raised NHS spending by Â£3.8bn in the 2016-17 year and that was in effect eaten up dealing with increased patient demand rather than new service investments. Labour wants to offer guarantees that NHS performance targets in England for A&E and routine surgery waiting times will be met. That may stretch the extra money the party wants to raise for the NHS. At the moment the NHS is falling short, though the Conservative Party in government said it wanted to get back to the A&E target of 95% of patients being seen or treated within four hours by next year. Running the service with the money available is one thing. Improving performance in the face of relentlessly rising patient demand is another. Read more from Hugh Pym It is not surprising to see social care mentioned in the manifesto - Labour has been promising something on the growing problems caring for the elderly and adults with disabilities for weeks. Much of what is included in the manifesto - the end to care workers' 15-minute flying visits for example - have been mentioned while Labour has been in opposition. The two headline pledges are an extra Â£8bn for the system over the lifetime of the next Parliament and the potential creation of a national care service. The extra money sounds a lot - last year councils spent just under Â£20bn on services, including care homes and home help. But unlike with the NHS, the budget for social care is not decided by central government. It is up to local councils to decide how much to spend. If they do not put in the same as they have been doing in previous years - and they argue that other cuts to sources of funding would make that difficult - the total amount spent may not necessarily go up. Much more radical would be the creation of a national care service. Ever since the NHS was formed after the end of the World War Two, there has been a two-tier system. The poorest get help towards the cost of care, while those with means are expected to meet the full cost themselves. Labour only promises to consult on a universal system  - and it is not yet clear what the party has in mind exactly. But there is a precedent. In 2010, at the end of the Gordon Brown government, Labour came up with a plan for a universal system that would require contributions from individuals - either through tax, an insurance scheme or from their own pocket. Read more from Nick Triggle One of Labour's most eye-catching promises is that it would scrap planned increases to the state pension age beyond the already-planned move to 66 in 2020. That puts in question the move to 67 for people retiring from 2028 and later moves to 68 and, possibly, 69 and 70. The increases are designed to save the taxpayer billions of pounds. Could some people be able to retire earlier than others in the future and still claim a full pension? Jeremy Corbyn points out that people in physically demanding jobs - in the emergency services, construction, care and in prisons - should not be expected to work into their late 60s. So Labour would commission a new review of pension ages to look at a flexible approach, taking into account different jobs and life expectancies.  Could this result in some people being allowed to retire earlier than others and still being able to claim the full pension? The former business leader John Cridland has only just completed a government-commissioned review of the state pension which recommended keeping the same pension age for everyone. He said there was ""no effective mechanism that has been tested that would be able to target those with lower life expectancy"". On how much pension will be paid, Labour had already committed itself to keeping the triple lock, the promise that the state pension will rise each year by inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. It could become a key point of difference in the campaign, given the speculation that the Conservatives might water down the guarantee by dropping the 2.5% element. The main policies on benefits are much as expected. Labour has been adamant for some time that it would stop job centres imposing benefit sanctions, scrap the under-occupancy charge - known as the bedroom tax - and reinstate housing benefit for 18 to 21-year-olds. Labour's defence policy appears towards the back of the leaked manifesto - on page 42 of 45. At first glance, it appears the most controversial subject for the party has been resolved. Labour has committed to renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system, despite Jeremy Corbyn's well-known opposition. Labour may have backed Trident, but has pledged to carry out a wider defence review His own concerns are reflected in a passage - in the particular draft version that the BBC has seen - stating that any prime minister should be ""extremely cautious"" about ever using weapons of ""mass destruction"".  And the document sets out how Labour would work towards a world free of nuclear weapons. There's also another potential caveat. Labour would carry out an immediate review of all defence policy if it wins the election. That won't please everyone in the military.  The armed forces are still trying to fund and implement the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review. Like the Conservatives, Labour has committed to spending 2% of the national income, or GDP, on defence - a Nato target. Though, interestingly, that is the only mention of the alliance. More time is spent talking about working with the UN. Labour reminds the electorate that it was the Conservatives - singly and in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - that have been responsible for the largest defence cuts in a generation. It promises to fully fund the armed forces in the future. But there is still no specific pledge to protect numbers or on equipment. Instead the party's focus appears to be on retention and on improving the lives of service families and veterans with better housing.

"This video can not be played The moment a BBC cameraman was 'run over by Corbyn car' BBC cameraman Giles Wooltorton has been released from hospital after his foot was run over by a car carrying Jeremy Corbyn. The incident happened as the Labour leader arrived at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London for a party meeting to discuss the draft general election manifesto. Mr Wooltorton was said to be in good spirits while waiting for an ambulance. By the evening, he was on his way home with two broken toes and bruising. Mr Corbyn was driven to the meeting by officers from the Metropolitan Police's royalty and specialist protection unit. A Met Police spokesman said the incident had been referred to the directorate of professional standards, which is responsible for the conduct of officers in the force. In a statement released shortly after the incident, the BBC said: ""An experienced BBC cameraman has been injured while filming at the Labour Party manifesto meeting. ""He has been taken to hospital for assessment and treatment. At the moment the BBC are focusing on their duty of care, making sure that he is OK.""

"Check the latest opinion polls trends with the poll tracker, which measures general election voting intention. Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker. Note on margin of error:Polling companies generally claim that 95% of the time, a poll of 1,000 people will be accurate within a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points. This means that a figure in the poll could be up to three percentage points higher or lower than that shown. For parties with smaller percentages, the margins of error are correspondingly smaller. Once again the polls, taken as a whole, were not a good guide to the election result. Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome. Read more from Peter Barnes Nearly all the final polls are now out. Ipsos Mori will publish on Thursday and ICM are expected to update their preliminary figures from earlier today. Apart from that, we're there. What should we take from them? First, it's worth making the obvious point that every single poll throughout the campaign has put the Conservative Party ahead. If Labour receives more votes tomorrow it will be a bigger polling failure than in 2015. Manifesto guide: Where the parties stand How the BBC reports polling day How to follow results night and what to watch for Second, the range of vote shares for the parties in polls published on Tuesday and Wednesday are CON 41-46%, LAB 34-40%, LD 7-10%, and UKIP 2-5%. Not all the polls separate out the SNP, Plaid Cymru or Green Party. We've looked a lot at the gap between the two top parties - arguably too much. But the polls suggest it could be anywhere between a one and 12-point Conservative lead, with Survation suggesting the closest result. That suggests anything from a small swing to Labour to a 2-3% swing to the Conservatives. And it's doubly difficult to estimate how that could play out in terms of the number of seats each party wins. So much will depend on variations in different parts of the country and in different types of constituency. There could be no national swing between Conservatives and Labour but still a significant shift in seats. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll will be published at 10pm on Thursday, when polls close. It would be an understatement to say it's eagerly awaited. The final polls in Scotland suggest a fairly settled picture - although there have only been seven of them during the whole campaign so there's not much to go on. The SNP are clearly out in front on 40% or a little higher. The Conservatives and Labour are in a battle for second place at around 25%, perhaps with the Conservatives' ahead by a nose. That would represent a significant shift from the actual 2015 result of SNP 50%, LAB 24%, CON 15%. In Wales, YouGov are the only company to have produced polls throughout the campaign so we have even less evidence. Their last, released on Wednesday, showed little change from the previous two. Labour remain on 46% and the Conservatives fall back one point to 34%. Plaid Cymru are on 9% with both the Lib Dems and UKIP on 5%. That implies a modest swing to Labour with UKIP losing well over half their 2015 votes. Three polls have been published since the weekend - by Opinium, Survation and ICM. None of them showed dramatic changes from what they'd had before. The race is still very close according to Survation - their phone poll showed similar figures to their weekend internet poll - but the Conservatives have a handsome lead according to ICM. Opinium's poll (CON 43, LAB 36, LD 8, UKIP 5, SNP 5, GRN 2) was their last of the campaign. Lots of other polls are expected today. We should have final figures from ComRes, ICM, Kantar Public and YouGov. Others are possible as well. We'll update the poll tracker as they are released. Ipsos Mori are expected to publish their final figures on Thursday. That won't get added to the BBC poll tracker because ofeditorial guidelines,external, which state that no opinion poll on any issue relating to the election can be published on polling day. Get the latest news in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The normal array of Saturday night polls have been published - six in total. All of them still have the Conservatives in the lead but by a widely-varying degree. The gap over Labour ranges from just one point in Survation's poll to 12 points according to ComRes. Clearly, the discrepancies between the polling companies are very large. And that obviously makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Survation's poll has the narrowest gap of any poll so far during the campaign. It's the only company that has not changed its methodology since 2015. But up to now they've not been especially favourable to Labour. Their poll was conducted today, after last night's Question Time special, where Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn faced questions from a live audience. And they found that more people who watched the programme said it made them more likely to vote Labour than Conservative. It's very unclear whether this could really have caused a significant shift though. A further complication is that most of Survation's polls in this campaign have been conducted by phone. This was an internet poll so it makes comparisons with their previous figures harder. Ipsos MORI also published a poll on Friday with a Conservative lead of 5%. In addition to the voting intention numbers, they reported a dramatic change in attitudes towards the two main party leaders. Since she became Prime Minister, Theresa May has always enjoyed positive approval figures - more people have said that they are satisfied with her performance than dissatisfied. But in their latest poll she has slumped to a negative overall figure of -7% (43% satisfied, 50% dissatisfied). Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn's rating has shot up. He's still in negative territory and, on -11%, still behind Theresa May. But that contrasts with -41% in March, before the election was called. Other pollsters have seen a similar trend. ComRes have also reported Theresa May's first negative negative rating (-3%). Opinium put Jeremy Corbyn on -12%, up from -35% at the start of the campaign. Theresa May has fallen to +6%. For ORB tonight's poll will be their last of the campaign. Their final figures are CON 45%, LAB 36%, LD 8% and UKIP 4%. Other companies will be publishing further polls in the final week of the campaign though. YouGov have also been updating their seat projection - that should also continue in the coming days. After their striking seat projection published last night, YouGov has a new poll this evening which has the narrowest gap between the main two parties so far during the campaign. It has the Conservatives on 42% and Labour on 39% - their highest rating in any poll since 2014. It's not all good news for Labour though. Kantar Public also published a poll on Wednesday with a slightly increased Conservative lead compared to their previous poll. They now have the Conservatives on 43% and Labour on 33%. Its not the only company which still shows a large gap. In fact, it's more than 10% according to ICM and ComRes. The main reason for this disparity is the different ways that the pollsters estimate turnout. Polling companies are sometimes accused of ""herding"" - manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. Nobody could accuse them of that at this election. If anything, the differences have become more stark as we approach election day. Scotland There was also a rare Scottish poll published on Wednesday afternoon. The SNP, on 43%, maintained the commanding lead that they've had throughout the campaign and for a long time before that. More interesting was that Labour and the Conservatives were on level pegging at 25%. That's the first time this year that the Conservatives haven't been in a clear second place. As with the other nations, though, it's hard to draw conclusions when there have been so few polls. The polls covered in the BBC tracker are standard voting intention polls. That is, they try to gauge levels of support for each of the parties across the country. They do not attempt to say how many seats each party would win. There's a good reason for that. The first-past-the-post electoral system means that there is no straightforward relationship between votes and seats won. The 2017 election could be almost a repeat of the 2015 result in terms of vote share but produce a very different outcome in terms of the number of MPs returned for each party. Clearly, though, people are interested in knowing how votes might translate into seats. SoYouGov,externalhave attempted to model how that could work. Their projection of a hung parliament has, understandably, caused a stir. The model used to make this projection is complicated. It's not based on a single poll, but on the responses of 50,000 people who have taken part in other YouGov polls. Nor does it work by just counting up how the respondents in each constituency said they would vote. Even with 50,000 people there wouldn't be nearly enough to have a reliable sample in each of the 650 constituencies in the UK. Instead, it uses demographic information about the people who take part in the polls, as well as information about where they live and how they've voted before, to try to work out how different types of people are likely to vote. Then it looks at the demographic make-up of each constituency and comes up with an estimate of the likely outcome. YouGov themselves have indicated that their projection is subject to quite a lot of uncertainty. And Stefan Shakespeare, the company's Chief Executive, has said that it would only take a small shift in favour of the Conservatives to see them win a healthy Conservative majority. So it should definitely be treated with caution. Wales update There's been no shortage of Britain-wide polls but in the individual nations it's a different story. With so few polls focused on the election in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland it's impossible to identify any well-supported trends. That said, there has been one Welsh poll since I last mentioned them which showed a very different picture from the two that had gone before. YouGov gave Labour a 10 point lead in Wales whereas previously they'd shown a clear Conservative advantage. The direction of shift is consistent with what we've seen in the national polls but it's very difficult to know what to make of the particular numbers. It's a huge turnaround and we really would need more evidence before drawing any firm conclusions. Five polls have been published this evening. Overall, they reinforce Thursday night's polls which suggested that the Conservative lead over Labour has shrunk again since last weekend but there are quite large differences between the pollsters' figures. ICM and ComRes have a larger gap between the two main parties than the other companies. They put it at 14% and 12% respectively but that's still down from what they were showing two weeks ago. The others have it at 6%-10%. There will no doubt be some talk about the fact that Labour has dropped two points in YouGov's poll compared to the one they published on Thursday. But that still means that the gap is narrower than they found last weekend and it would be unwise to read too much into a small change between two individual polls. The general trend is clear. The Conservatives are still ahead but Labour has closed the gap. Is the shift believable? The godfather of psephology or the study of elections, Sir David Butler, said this week that the movement in the polls over this campaign is bigger than in any election he's covered since 1945. But many experts think that election campaigns don't make much difference - voters' views are set years or months before polling day. So does that mean the polls must be wrong? Not necessarily. Voters have become much more volatile than they used to be - much less loyal to a single party. Chris Prosser and Jane Green from theBritish Election Study,externalhave shown that over the last 50 years the proportion of voters who switch parties between elections has risen from around 15% in the 1960s and 1970s to 43% in 2015. We can't be sure that the same will happen this time and many of the people who do switch might have made up their minds before the campaign started. It's also possible that people who said they were going to switch at the start of the campaign have gone back to the party they supported before. But if voters are more likely to change allegiance than in the past then perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised if the polls show large movements. How reliable is Labour's vote? One reason for caution about Labour's advance is that their improved polling numbers are based on very high levels of support among young voters and people who didn't vote in 2015. A big part of the problem with the polls in 2015 was that they failed to estimate accurately the difference in turnout rates among different groups of voters. In particular, they underestimated the turnout gap between young and old voters. As I've mentioned before, many of the pollsters have adjusted their methods to try to overcome this problem. But concerns remain about whether the people who say they'll vote Labour will actually do so on 8 June. If they don't then Labour's vote share could be lower than the polls suggest. Two new polls published on Thursday night suggest a further continuation of the trend we've seen throughout the campaign so far. The gap between the Conservatives and Labour has narrowed again. It's down to eight points in Kantar Public's poll and just five points in YouGov's - smaller than the actual gap between the parties at the 2015 election. The Manchester attack has, rightly, meant that the country's attention has been focused away from the election. But as the campaign resumes, it's inevitable that people will ask whether it's had an effect on how people might vote. So it's important to note that Kantar Public's poll was conducted before the attack, but YouGov's was done afterwards - on Wednesday and Thursday. That doesn't mean we can say that the latest shift is related to the attack. Theresa May has consistently had a strong lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issues of defence and security. That hasn't changed. YouGov found that 55% of respondents trusted Theresa May to make the right decisions to keep Britain safe from terrorism compared to just 33% who trusted Jeremy Corbyn. It's possible that the polls are still reacting to the fallout of the manifesto launches last week - and the revisions to the Conservatives' social care plans announced on Monday (they denied it was a U-turn). There could also just be an element of natural polling variation. Whatever the cause, the important thing to remember is to look at the general trend rather than concentrating too much on individual polls. The Conservatives retain a clear lead over Labour but the gap has closed significantly. After the week of the manifesto launches for the main GB-wide parties, the trend of Labour improvement that we've seen throughout the campaign is continuing. In fact, four polls released on Saturday, for the Sunday papers, suggest that the Labour advance has strengthened. And, while the Lib Dems and UKIP are still below where they were when the election was announced, for the first time it looks as though the latest Labour rise is coming at the expense of the Conservatives. The Conservative lead was generally around 20 points or a little above in the middle of April. It's down to between 9 and 13 points in today's polls. As ever, the figures should be treated with caution. It's particularly worth noting that none of the most recent polls come from the companies that tend to put Labour on a lower figure. ICM and Kantar Public both make adjustments based on turnout rates for different groups of people at previous elections. They've had Labour at a lower level than some of the other companies throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see whether their next polls follow a similar pattern. Looking beneath the voting intention figures there are some clues about what might be causing the shift towards Labour that we've seen. One is voters' responses to the manifestos. For example, Survation found that nearly half of respondents opposed Conservative plans for changes to the system of funding for social care. By contrast, Labour's plan to increase income tax for people earning over Â£80,000 was backed by more than six out of ten people and opposed by under a quarter. Jeremy Corbyn has also seen an improvement in his approval ratings although he still lags a long way behind Theresa May. For example, Opinium have him on a net figure of -18 this week, up from -28 last week. Despite the significant moves we should still remember that the Conservatives retain a large lead by historical standards. If today's polls were repeating on 8 June it would be the biggest gap between the two parties since Tony Blair's landslide in 1997 in terms of share of the vote. There's also some evidence in the polls that the Labour vote is ""softer"" than the Conservative vote. In other words, more Labour voters than Conservative voters say they might change their minds. Four polls over the weekend reinforced the picture of aLabourimprovement during the course of the campaign so far. ORB, Opinium, ComRes and YouGov all had them at 30% or above - clearly above the levels seen at around the time the election was announced. However, this increase has not come at the expense of theConservativeswho remain in the mid-to-high 40s with a commanding lead. The main losers have beenUKIP, who are down in the 3-6% range. If the current polls were reflected in the final result it would mean the two main parties between them capturing a significantly larger share of the vote than at recent elections. In 2015, they received a total of 69%. The polls suggest a joint share of almost 80%. You have to go back to 1992 to find an election where the total Conservative and Labour share was close to that - the figure was 78%. The last time it was above 80% was 1979. All the polls shown in the tracker report vote intention share across Great Britain, but that's not very helpful for working out what's going on in parts of the UK where other parties stand. However as we've only seen two campaign polls in Scotland, two in Wales and one in Northern Ireland so far, there's not very much evidence to go on. Having said that, both of the Scottish polls, conducted by Survation and YouGov, have given theSNPover 40% with a clear lead over the Conservatives on 28% and Labour down in third place on 18%. In Wales, two YouGov polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour, but with a smaller gap than across Britain as a whole. Like in the national polls, Labour's share has seen an improvement from the beginning of the campaign.Plaid Cymruare back in third place In Northern Ireland, the single Lucid Talk poll gave theDUPa narrow lead overSinn Feinwith theUUP,SDLPand theAllianceall some way back. As well as asking people which party they intend to vote for, pollsters also ask which issues are the most important. In 2015 the three biggest issues were theNHS,immigrationandthe economy. A significant change at this election is the emergence ofBrexit. Polls conducted since the election was called have put it at the top of the list of important issues ahead of theNHSin second place with the economy and immigration battling it out for third. This may help to explain, at least in part, the Conservatives' lead in the polls. So far as we can tell, they've managed to attract the support of a large number of new voters who backed leave at last year's referendum whilst holding on to most of their own supporters who backed remain - many of whom now think that the Government has a duty to implement the outcome of the referendum. As everybody knows, the polls got the 2015 general election wrong. They suggested that the likely outcome was a hung parliament but, as we know, the Conservatives won an overall majority. So is it worth paying attention to them this time? Well, we certainly shouldn't assume that the result will be exactly what the polls say. But that doesn't mean they're completely useless. For one thing, critics have perhaps exaggerated other polling ""disasters"". The belief that the polls were just as bad at the EU referendum and in the US Presidential election is widely held. However, whilst some polls gave a misleading picture at the referendum, others were pretty close. We reported at the timethat the polls overall indicated a very narrow race in the weeks running up to referendum day. Similarly, at the US election,the national polls weren't that far offin terms of the share of the vote won by Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton - Clinton actually won the popular vote by over 2%. It was state polls that were unreliable and led to a misleading impression as to who would emerge from the Electoral College system as president. In both cases, if all we'd taken from the polls was that the votes would be close, we would have been on the right lines. The polling companies have also made adjustments to try to prevent the problems of 2015 from happening again and to resolve issues that arose at the referendum. These methodological changes vary from pollster to pollster but there are some general trends. Several of them now ask the people who take part about their educational background. The aim, as with questions about class, age, gender and region is to get a sample of people who are representative of the population as a whole. Others have developed more sophisticated ways to estimate how likely it is that somebody who takes part in a poll will actually vote. Just asking people whether they will vote is not a good guide. Of course, we can't be sure whether these adjustments will make the polls more accurate. So some people will no doubt decide to ignore them all together. But there's still clearly an appetite for them. No fewer than 30 have been conducted since the Prime Minister made her surprise announcement on 18 April. That's more than one a day. General election: What you need to know It's now three weeks since the election was announced and the official campaign is well under way. After Theresa May's surprise statement, the Conservatives saw their poll rating jump with several polls suggesting a comfortable 20 point lead. Since then, nothing very dramatic has happened. There has been a modest uptick for Labour, who are generally up to the high 20s or around 30 - up from the mid 20s just after the announcement. But that still leaves a very large gap between the main two parties. UKIP seem to have slipped a little further down and perhaps the Lib Dems have also fallen back a bit, although these trends are not clear. Most opinion polls, and all of the ones covered in the BBC poll tracker, are either conducted by telephone or online. For phone polls the polling company rings up landline and mobile numbers. In principle, anyone with a phone could be asked to participate. For internet polls, the company maintains a panel of people who are prepared to take part. For each poll they will contact the required number of panel members. In both cases the company will aim to survey a sample of people who are representative of the country as a whole - in terms of age, gender, social class, etc. They will generally then apply weighting adjustments if one or other group is over-represented or under-represented in their sample. It's also common to seek a representative sample or apply a weighting based on past-voting behaviour.

"Michael Foot and Jeremy Corbyn - Labour leaders from different eras Labour's draft general election manifesto has been compared by some with the party's 1983 manifesto - how do the two documents measure up? The 1983 manifesto was written at a time of economic turmoil, mass unemployment and Cold War tensions and is arguably more ambitious in its scope. It is certainly framed in more forceful language. ""Within days of taking office, Labour will begin to implement an emergency programme of action, to bring about a complete change of direction for Britain,"" it says. ""Our priority will be to create jobs and give a new urgency to the struggle for peace. In many cases we will be able to act immediately."" Labour's draft election manifesto leaked At-a-glance: Labour's draft manifesto In full - Leaked manifesto,external Labour's 1983 manifesto,external They are very different documents in many ways, written to reflect the concerns of their respective times. Jeremy Corbyn's draft manifesto uses a more measured tone, talking about ""delivering a fairer, more prosperous society for the many, not just the few"". There is no mention of socialism, in contrast to the nine mentions it gets in 1983. But at the 2017 manifesto's heart is the same commitment to using government intervention and public money to boost industrial development and create jobs. In 1983, Labour leader Michael Foot had a five year ""emergency programme"" to rebuild industry and end mass unemployment. In 2017, Jeremy Corbyn proposes a ""a ten-year national investment plan to upgrade Britain's economy"". This video can not be played Labour propose massive public investment, withdrawal from the EEC and nuclear disarmament in their manifesto for the 1983 general election Both manifestos propose higher taxes on the rich and a crack down on tax avoidance. In 1983, Labour said: ""We shall reform taxation so that the rich pay their full share and the tax burden on the lower paid is reduced."" In 2017, Labour says ""only the highest 5% of earners will be asked to contribute more in tax to help fund our public services"". The 1983 manifesto goes further, proposing ""a new annual tax on net personal wealth"" to ""ensure that the richest 100,000 of the population make a fair and proper contribution to tax revenue"". Both manifestos include plans for a National Investment Bank to boost industrial development and support research and development. The 2017 version would allow the government to use public money to support long-term, higher-risk investment that the bank's are reluctant to touch. The 1983 version of the National Investment Bank is more interventionist. It proposes drawing up development plans with ""all leading companies - national and multinational, public and private"". Like the 2017 plan, it would provide access to credit, but a Labour government would have the power to ""invest in individual companies, to purchase them outright or to assume temporary control"". The 1983 manifesto also includes a commitment to reintroducing exchange controls, scrapped by the Conservatives in 1979, to ""counter currency speculation"" and stop capital ""flowing overseas"". In 1983, Labour was committed to scrapping Britain's nuclear weapons, saying ""we are the only party that offers a non-nuclear defence policy."" In 2017, Labour says it supports ""the renewal of the Trident submarine system"". But, in a possible nod to Jeremy Corbyn's longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons, it adds ""any prime minister should be extremely cautious about ordering the use of weapons of mass destruction which would result in the indiscriminate killing of millions of innocent civilians"". Both manifestos stress the need for Britain to work for nuclear disarmament through international bodies. Although the 2017 draft manifesto backs Britain's exit from the EU, following last year's referendum result, it is less Eurosceptic in tone than the 1983 document. It praises the EU for protecting workers' rights and the environment and vows to fight to keep them in Brexit negotiations. The 1983 manifesto says European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, ""was never devised to suit us, and our experience as a member of it has made it more difficult for us to deal with our economic and industrial problems"". Labour promised to begin withdrawal from the EEC without a referendum if it won power. The 1983 manifesto pledges to renationalise the industries privatised by the Thatcher government. The 2017 manifesto includes plans to renationalise the Royal Mail and the railways - which were still state-owned in 1983 - and part-nationalise the energy industry. Labour would also ""take control"" of the National Grid if it won power. The trade unions play a more central role in Labour's 1983 plans for the economy, reflecting the greater power they had at that time. The 2017 manifesto includes plans to restore some of that power by repealing the 2016 Trade Union Act and bringing back collective pay bargaining to some sectors. A Ministry of Labour would be introduced to oversee increased unionisation across the workforce. Both manifestos include plans to build more council houses and offer more protections to private renters. They also include plans to help more people buy their own homes and crack down on leasehold abuses. Jeremy Corbyn would also halt the sale of social housing, in an echo of the 1983 manifesto's pledge to end council house sales. Labour's 2017 manifesto includes plans to cap energy prices. In 1983, the party would have gone much further. It proposed ""a new Price Commission to investigate companies, monitor price increases and order price freezes and reductions. These controls will be closely linked to our industrial planning, through agreed development plans with the leading, price-setting firms"". It would ""take full account of these measures in the national economic assessment, to be agreed each year with the trade unions"". Increased spending on the NHS is a key priority in both the 1983 and the 2017 manifestos. In 1983, Labour pledged to ""increase health service expenditure by 3% per annum in real terms"". In 2017, Labour is promising to spend an extra Â£6bn to be paid for tax increases on higher earners. Labour's 2017 manifesto vows to ""reverse"" privatisation of the NHS. In 1983, the party promised to curb the expansion of private health care and ""take into the NHS those parts of the profit-making private sector which can be put to good use"". ""We will not allow the development of a two-tier health service, where the rich can jump the queue,"" the 1983 manifesto adds. Both manifestos include a commitment to cut class sizes to below 30, although the 1983 manifesto pledges this for all schools, while the 2017 version says it will initially be for ""all 5, 6, and 7 year olds"", with the rest to follow ""as resources allow"". Jeremy Corbyn is also pledging to introduce free school meals for all primary school children, paid for by removing the VAT exemption on private school fees. The 1983 manifesto includes plans to charge VAT on private school fees and promises to ""re-establish the school meals and milk services, cut back by the Tories"". It describes private schools as a ""major obstacle to a free and fair education system"" and promises to end their charitable status and ""integrate"" them into the local authority sector ""where necessary"". It also rejects the ""Tory proposals for student loans,"" a policy echoed in Jeremy Corbyn's pledge to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for low-income students. The 1983 manifesto also pledges to scrap corporal punishment - the beating of children with canes or straps - in schools. The Conservatives outlawed this in state schools three years later. Net migration to the UK - the difference between the numbers coming to live in the country and those leaving - was 17,000 in 1983 - a fraction of what it is today. In 1983, Labour said it accepted the need for immigration controls but vowed to scrap Conservative laws restricting the rights of Commonwealth citizens to remain in the UK and replace them with ""a citizenship law that does not discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons"". In 2017, Labour says it would scrap the Conservative target of reducing net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" and instead make  a positive case for ""controlled"" migration to boost the economy. It would bring in laws to stop companies undercutting wages with migrant workers or recruiting workers solely from abroad. The internet may have been a distant dream in 1983, but then, just as now, broadband was a major preoccupation for Labour politicians, it seems. The 1983 manifesto envisages a ""national, broadband network"" to carry a ""wide range of new telecommunications services"" and ""greater variety in the provision of television"". But, it adds, this important new system must be ""under firm public control"", with the job of building it handed exclusively to ""publicly-owned British Telecommunications"". Thirty four years later, the Labour manifesto includes a whole raft of broadband promises, including ""universal superfast broadband availability by 2022"", although there are no plans to renationalise BT to deliver it.

"Britain's railway track is already quasi-nationalised through Network Rail So how radical is Labour's draft manifesto really? On the face of it, it looks like the root and branch reversal of 40 years of government policy. But let's take a moment to see how radical, how do-able, these proposals really are from a business, rather than  a public finance, perspective. Let's start with the easy ones. This actually happens from time to time anyway. The East Coast Main Line spent several years in public ownership after it was handed back to the government by National Express in 2009, before being privatised again in 2015. It performed pretty well in public hands. It paid nearly a billion pounds in fees to the government and still managed to make a profit for the Treasury, while carrying more passengers and getting good passenger satisfaction scores. So there is some evidence that repeating that exercise each time a current rail franchise expires could work. However, freezing rail fares, extending free wifi, ending driver-only operated trains and improving disabled access would freeze income while increasing costs. It might be harder to replicate the relative success of the East Coast Main Line experiment with these additional pressures. The track is already quasi-nationalised through Network Rail, and the government pays a total of more than Â£3bn in subsidies to the industry each year. Of all the privatisations since Thatcher, this is probably considered one of the least effective in financial terms for the government. The question is whether passengers' memories of British Rail are clear enough to make a comparison to their experience today. This is hardly a surprise item given a version of it was in the last Labour manifesto, and the Conservatives have committed to do much the same. The same criticisms over deterring investment and encouraging the withdrawal of cheaper fares for switchers apply to both parties. Labour's draft election manifesto leaked At-a-glance: Draft manifesto Now the trickier ones The setting up of publicly owned utilities in every region of the UK is a much more difficult exercise. Although there is little detail, the government would essentially be starting from scratch in an industry that it hasn't been involved in for decades. Quizzed this morning about how this would work, the policy chief talked of setting up regional co-operatives, but where they would spring from and how they would be managed is not clear. The cost of transporting gas and electricity across cables and through pipes makes up nearly a quarter of consumers' energy bills. Some of that money goes to privately-owned National Grid, which last year made a profit of Â£3bn, although it no longer owns all of the UK gas transportation infrastructure. It also distributes gas and electricity in the United States and makes a much bigger profit margin here than it does there - a fact that has drawn heavy criticism from consumer groups. Even if you agree that National Grid is charging the energy companies too much - to nationalise it you would presumably have to buy it back. Its current value is Â£38bn, but a lot of that is made up of its US business which presumably a Labour government wouldn't want to buy! The UK business is estimated to be worth around Â£25bn. A chunky purchase, but one that could quite easily financed in that it makes enough money to repay the interest on any money borrowed to buy it. A proposal to cap pay for top earners at 20 times that of the lowest paid in an organisation is a radical one, and a throwback to the 1970s in the sense that that was the last time pay differentials were anything near that multiple. Currently the average FTSE 100 boss earns around 150 times the amount his or her lowest paid employee makes. Even companies seen as progressive would fail this new test. The chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, Charlie Mayfield, made around 75 times as much as his partners on the shop floor. There is widespread outrage over high pay - even among some shareholders of private companies - and we can expect some action on this issue in the Tory manifesto. I will leave proposals on NHS funding, tuition fees etc and the impact on the public purse to my more knowledgeable colleagues. The real essence of this leaked document is that coursing through it is a simple idea. When it comes to doing just about anything - GOVERNMENT KNOWS BEST. That is an age-old political decision between the old left and old right. The Conservatives have moved left with their market interventions and attack on business excess. With this document - Labour have moved quite a long way further left. Correction 19 May 2017: The reference to rail subsidies has been amended to clarify that the Â£3bn figure covers the whole rail industry and not just train operating companies.

"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon tells Today the 'defence budget will grow every year' The Conservatives would increase defence spending by 0.5% more than inflation every year if they win the election, Theresa May has said. Mrs May said her party would also continue to meet the pledge to spend at least 2% of national income on defence. But ex-Joint Forces Command chief Sir Richard Barrons said Britain's armed forces were ""not good enough"" to deal with emerging risks and terror threats. And Labour accused the Conservatives of ""hypocrisy on defence"" spending. Labour manifesto draft leaked Election live: Rolling updates on reaction to leak Kuenssberg: No-one can say 'they're all the same' The Conservatives' pledge came after Sir Richard and other senior military figures wrote an open letter to the prime minister calling for more funding for Britain's armed forces. The signatories warned that the services were having to make ""damaging savings"" at a time when the likelihood of combat operations was increasing. And Sir Richard added: ""Our armed forces - and indeed, those of our Nato allies - are not big enough, resilient enough, good enough, don't have enough capability, to deal with the sorts of risks and threats that are emerging in the world as it's turning out today."" Conservative Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon replied to Sir Richard's complaint, telling BBC Radio 4's Today: ""I don't think you'll find a single former service chief who doesn't want more spent on defence. ""He's passionate about defence and so am I, which is why the defence budget is growing and that's why we're investing now."" Sir Michael said the government was investing in two new aircraft carriers, purchased eight F35 aircraft, had started building new frigates, armoured vehicles for the army and maritime patrol aircraft for the RAF. He said the UK was one of only four countries in the world building aircraft carriers and was currently building two of them. ""The first Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier will be out on sea trials in a few weeks time - so we're adding to our defence - and we're adding to the equipment our armed forces need and the budget will increase every single year,"" he said. He said Royal Navy destroyers and frigates were in the Gulf protecting the American aircraft carrier that is ""leading the fight against Daesh terrorism"". ""You certainly need aircraft carriers in an uncertain world,"" he said. He also criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""He's essentially a pacifist and would be a very dangerous leader, I think, of our country.  If he was ever put in charge of our defences.  If you've got armed forces, you've got to be prepared to use them."" But shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said Labour was committed to the 2% target and added: ""The Tories' hypocrisy on defence knows no bounds. Their cuts have left our forces more under-resourced and underpaid than at any time in the modern era. ""The severe cuts imposed on the defence budget since 2010 have seen the Army shrink to 78,000, its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars and far short of the last Tory manifesto pledge to keep it above 82,000."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown, who is also a former Royal Marine, said: ""This Conservative government has slashed funding on defence, cut our Royal Marines and left our troops on the front line without basic equipment.""

"Lord Bird says successive governments have failed to tackle the roots of poverty ""Poverty is stitched into the system,"" says Lord Bird, the outspoken and larger-than-life Big Issue founder and campaigner on homelessness. But he has plans to unpick it - and says he has been in talks with Theresa May about a new approach to tackling poverty if she is re-elected as prime minister. ""I'm expectant. I have great expectations,"" he says of his discussions with Mrs May about a new focus on preventing poverty before it takes root. Lord Bird says Theresa May is talking to him about his focus on poverty prevention They might seem like an unlikely pairing - Mrs May, the clergyman's daughter and John Bird, who learned to read in prison, but he says she has engaged with his ideas on prevention. The cross-bench peer is proposing a ""prevention department"" or a ""prevention unit"", working across health, education, social services, police and prisons. He says successive prime ministers have been ""chummy"" with him about ideas to tackle poverty but Mrs May seemed particularly interested in this shift towards a  systematic strategy of prevention. Is work 'fair and decent'? See where Lord Bird slept rough Theresa May's poverty headache Lord Bird says he wantsa fence at the top of the cliff, rather than ambulances picking up pieces at the bottom,external. The billions spent on the rats' nest of consequences of poverty - in educational underachievement, bad health, poor employment, drink and drug abuse and the criminal justice system - would be better targeted at prevention. And if Mrs May returns to Downing Street, he will be knocking on her door ""to put her money where her mouth is"". He says he told her a couple of ""home truths"" - including that he was tired of being wheeled out by ministers who wanted to be associated with what the Big Issue has achieved for the homeless, while the big underlying problems remained unresolved. The Big Issue, founded by Lord Bird, has helped homeless people to earn a living He is scathing about decades of ministerial attempts to address poverty. ""Most of them are a bit like the alcoholic that won't admit that they're a drunk. ""They don't want to admit that they're overseeing a system which at the end of their time in office will still be a failure."" He accuses governments of coming up with gimmicky pilot projects that get a few headlines but never really scratch the surface. ""They show it to you and sign a piece of paper saying they want to end poverty. But they go on spending the money in the same old way."" He also argues strongly that poverty is not just about material deprivation - and that anti-poverty efforts need to be about raising aspirations and opening up opportunities. ""I know that the poor are materially better off than when I was a boy - but emotionally, psychologically and mentally, they're worse off."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants investment in education and a higher living wage He says those at the bottom of the heap have been hurt by an economy dominated by a ""horrible mix of consumerism and the financial industry"". But he says the first step has to be addressing basic need. ""If you can't feed, you can't think. ""You've got this underlying situation where many, many families in this country are just about holding on. ""What we have to realise is that the lack of material security undermines everything else. ""So when people chastise the poor for not getting off their rears, it's often because with that material lack of independence all the other lights go out, the whole tree goes out."" ""My mum and dad had enormous poverty - they were never going to raise their eyes above material poverty, because they'd been destroyed."" But he is angry at what he sees as a lack of ambition in poverty initiatives. ""They don't look on the poor as the same species as themselves. ""I also want to address the paucity of education, the social engagement. And that's when you fall out with the great and the good."" Tim Farron says the Liberal Democrats would end spending cuts in schools He says there has been a misplaced fear of being seen as ""elitist"" or ""paternalistic"" - and that tackling poverty should be about opening up the worlds of art, history, politics and economics. Schools should be teaching everyone about how financial markets operate, he says. ""Most capitalists don't even know how capitalism works these days,"" he says. He accuses the social services system of being ""vapid and ineffective"". ""They're not stopping poverty. All they're doing is keeping the poor poor. Why is social security not called social opportunity?"" Whichever party wins the general election will face pressing questions about poverty, whether it's homelessness, food bank users or the out-of-sight struggles of those working but still not making ends meet. Official figures this year showed thattwo-thirds of children living in poverty were now in working families, the highest levels on record. The Labour Party says it will ""stand up for the many"", with the promise of a Â£10 per hour living wage and scrapping benefits changes that ""risk pushing even more children and families into poverty"". It is also committed to extra spending on education and student support The Liberal Democrats have promised extra investment schools, including protecting the pupil premium for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are also ""committed to ending rough sleeping in Britain"" and funding emergency accommodation The Conservatives in office have emphasised the importance of work as a route out of poverty - and say introducing universal credit and the National Living Wage have helped tackle poverty Lord Bird, whomade the journey from sleeping roughand washing up in the kitchens at the House of Lords to sitting as a peer on the red benches, will keep rattling the windows of whoever gets elected.

"This video can not be played The moment a BBC cameraman was 'run over by Corbyn car' BBC cameraman Giles Wooltorton has been released from hospital after his foot was run over by a car carrying Jeremy Corbyn. The incident happened as the Labour leader arrived at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London for a party meeting to discuss the draft general election manifesto. Mr Wooltorton was said to be in good spirits while waiting for an ambulance. By the evening, he was on his way home with two broken toes and bruising. Mr Corbyn was driven to the meeting by officers from the Metropolitan Police's royalty and specialist protection unit. A Met Police spokesman said the incident had been referred to the directorate of professional standards, which is responsible for the conduct of officers in the force. In a statement released shortly after the incident, the BBC said: ""An experienced BBC cameraman has been injured while filming at the Labour Party manifesto meeting. ""He has been taken to hospital for assessment and treatment. At the moment the BBC are focusing on their duty of care, making sure that he is OK.""

"So here it is. Forty-five pages that reveal Jeremy Corbyn's plans to transform the country if he can persuade enough voters that he is the man to be PM, and his vision is the best way forward. In a draft of Labour's manifesto, seen by the BBC, is a long, long list of plans, ideas - some new, some predictable, some rather more surprising. Before going on, it's worth saying it is yet to be signed off as a final version - that's due to happen in a meeting tomorrow of Labour bigwigs. Read Labour's leaked draft manifesto,external Labour's draft election manifesto leaked The maps that reveal where this election could be won General election: What you need to know But from what we have seen, which Labour senior figures acknowledge ""is the real thing"" subject to a few last minute tweaks, it is a rundown that will be manna from heaven for Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, contains ideas that poll well with swathes of voters, but could be a challenge to the concept of pleasing much of the traditional centre ground of ""Middle England"". The draft manifesto promises to scrap tuition fees, to ban fracking, to bring back national pay bargaining in some industries and only to consider military action where all other options have ""been exhausted"". It suggests bringing some energy ""back into public ownership"", with a strong emphasis on renewables and a promise to introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" to keep average bills below Â£1,000. The draft manifesto has yet to be signed off It promises to suspend arms sales immediately to Saudi Arabia, to cut the voting age to 16, to increase tax on the wealthiest 5%. There are notable big contrasts with Conservative plans - no target on cutting immigration, a warning there will be ""no false promises"", and guarantees, rather than cutting welfare, that payments to some groups will see rises. There could yet be changes to these ideas. Labour big cheeses will discuss and dissect the plans tomorrow. But it's clear as day that this will be an election where voters will not be able to say ""they're all the same"".

"Most manifestos are not out yet - so, while we wait, here's a rundown of significant policy commitments made so far during the election campaign. It will be updated as new pledges are made. TheLib Demmanifesto will include acommitment to another EU referendumon the final Brexit deal, in which the party would campaign for Remain. Tim Farron has said campaigning against ""hard"" Brexit will be ""front and centre"" of the party's election campaign. The party says the UK should remain in the single market and a vote should take place on the ""final deal"" between the UK and the European Union. Labour'sshadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hasruled out a second referendum, but said there would have to be transitional arrangements at the end of the two-year Article 50 process. He said Labour would prioritise trade with the EU; it might stay in the customs union; it would give EU citizens a unilateral guarantee that they could stay on in Britain, and replace the government's proposed Great Repeal Bill - which would scrap the 1972 European Communities Act and incorporate many existing EU laws applying to the UK into domestic law - with an EU Rights and Protections Bill. Conservativeleader Theresa May has said theUK ""cannot possibly"" remain part of the single marketas it would mean ""not leaving the EU at all"". She also says the UK must seek a new customs agreement as its current membership of the customs union prevents it from striking trade deals around the world. She says voters need to give a strong message that they back her to boost her UK's negotiating position in the talks with the rest of the EU. SNPleader Nicola Sturgeon has been pushing for Scotland - which voted to remain in the EU - to have a special status after Brexit, including remaining in the single market. She has called for asecond independence referendumbefore the Brexit package has been finalised. TheGreen Partywould offera second referendumon the details of any Brexit deal, with 16 and 17-year-olds given a vote. Read more: Where the parties stand on Brexit Labourhas pledgednot to raise income tax for those earning less than Â£80,000 a yearas part of an election ""personal tax guarantee"" for 95% of taxpayers - the top 5% of earners would pay more to fund public services. Recent cuts to capital gains tax would be reversed. VAT would not rise. The party plans to create one million new jobs by pumping Â£250bn directly into the economy over ten years. Another Â£100bn would be spent to set up a publicly-owned national investment bank, which would be expected to raise another Â£150bn. Banks would be required in law to keep high street branches open. Any company bidding for a public sector contract would be required to pay its own suppliers within 30 days, and fines might be introduced for private firms who persistently pay late. TheConservativeshaveruled out a VAT rise. Theresa May has also said she has ""no plans"" to raise other taxes after the election, but has so far not repeated a 2015 pledge that also ruled out rises in income tax and National Insurance. There are plans to press ahead with increases to the effective Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to Â£1m, with a new transferable main residence allowance of Â£175,000 per person. This will be paid for by reducing the tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than Â£150,000. TheLib Demspledge to put 1p on income tax to pay for increased health spending.  The money raised would primarily be invested in social care which will get Â£2bn a year, and care outside of hospital, mental health and public health. The married couples tax allowance abolished. TheGreen Partyis expected to unveil plans to raise income tax for the better off, and changes to inheritance tax. Scotland has powers to set its own rate of income tax. However,SNPfirst minister Nicola Sturgeon hasdismissed the idea of raising the top rate of income taxfor those earning more than Â£150,000 from 45% to 50%, as has been proposed by Scottish Labour. Labourhas pledged to raise corporation tax for larger businesses from its present rate of 19% to 26% by the end of the next parliament. Smaller firms with profits below Â£300,000 a year will see more modest rises - up to 21% by 2020-21. The party says itwould raise billions of pounds for public services with a new taxon financial transactions - known as a ""Robin Hood"" tax. It has also warned BAE Systems it could lose future contracts under Labour unless its boss took a Â£7m pay cut. Analysis: The problem with corporation tax TheLib Demswould raise corporation tax to 20%. TheGreen Partyis expected to unveil plans to raise corporation tax for big businesses. Jeremy Corbyn has said""all aspects"" of defence would be reviewedifLabourwon power. Military action would only be taken as a last resort. The UK would pursue anindependent foreign policy, and would not ""hand hold"" US president Donald Trump. Corbyn would appoint a minister for peace. TheLib Demswould""maintain a credible nuclear deterrent"", but Tim Farron has advocated replacing the current system of continuous-at-sea deterrence with more irregular patrolling patterns. The party would givegraduates in technical and engineering subjects Â£10,000 to join the armed forces, under plans to tackle recruitment problems. It also pledged to keep defence spending at the Nato benchmark of 2% of national income. There is no indication that theConservativesare about to abandon their commitment to go ahead with building replacements for the UK's Vanguard fleet of four submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles. TheConservativeswill once again aim tocut net migration to the ""tens of thousands""in their election manifesto. The target, set by David Cameron in 2010, has so far not been met. Laboursays it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit but that new immigration controls should not be the ""overarching priority"" as the UK leaves. For theLib Dems, Tim Farron has said fixed migration target hurt UK businesses, hospitals and universities. UKIPsay they wouldcut net migration levels to zerowithin five years by almost halving immigration into the UK. They want to align the number of people coming to the UK with those leaving. Unskilled and low-skilled labour would be banned for five years while skilled workers and students would need visas. Laboursays it willspend an extra Â£37bn on the NHS in Englandover the next five years if it wins power. This would include Â£10bn on upgrading IT systems and repairing buildings, would be funded by tax increases and capital borrowing. The party also plans toban adverts for junk food and sweetsfrom all TV shows broadcast before 9pm as part of a planned child health bill to tackle childhood obesity. The aim is to halve the number of overweight youngsters within 10 years, and cut the Â£6bn annual cost to the NHS of obesity. Public health budgets would be ring-fenced to allow councils to invest in leisure activities and health awareness campaigns.A planned programme of hospital services closures would be suspendedacross England,the current 1% cap on pay rises for NHS workers would be scrapped, tuition free for student nurses  and midwives would be protected, and safe NHS staffing levels enshrined in law.Car parking charges at NHS England hospitals would be scrappedby raising insurance tax on private healthcare to 20%. TheConservatives'childhood obesity plan announced last August,externalset out the action local communities, the food industry, schools and the NHS should be taking over the next 10 years.The 1983 Mental Health Act would be replacedwith new laws tackling ""unnecessary detention"" in England and Wales, and 10,000 more NHS mental health staff recruited in England by 2020. TheLib Demssupport the introduction of aregulated cannabis market in the UK, arguing legalising and regulating cannabis delivers significant benefits to public health and takes pressure off the criminal justice system. They would ensure access to HIV prevention drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) on the NHS for people in high-risk groups. TheGreen Partywould remove the involvement of the private sector in the health service, and increase spending. It would match mental health spending to the amount spent on physical health. TheWomen's Equality Partywould introduce a right to paid leave for carers. Labourwouldspend Â£4.8bn a year to keep up with rising costs and Â£335m so no school loses from a funding overhaul, to be paid for by corporation tax rises. There are also plans toextend free school mealsto all primary school pupils in England, proposing that the cost would be covered by introducing VAT on private school fees.Scrapped Education Maintenance Allowance grants would be reinstated. These were means-tested payments of between Â£10 and Â£30 per week intended to encourage 16- to 18-year-olds to stay in sixth forms and further education colleges. Labour would also boost adult education, making some free courses available, and fund an ""arts pupil premium"" for primary schools. It is believed the party's manifesto could make the abolition of tuition fees for higher education a goal. TheLib Demswouldspend Â£7bn to protect per-pupil funding, to be partly funded by staying in the EU single market. TheGreen Partywouldscrap tuition fees, and reinstate the Education Maintenance Allowance grant. UKIPwould block the opening of new Muslim schools until, it says, more progress has been made integrating Muslims into mainstream society, and close any school where there iÂ­s evidence of IslamisÂ­t ideology being taugÂ­ht or imposed on chilÂ­dren. Theresa May has said aConservativegovernment would not scrap university tuition fees in England. TheSNPis toincrease the budget of head teachers in Scotland by Â£120mto invest in measures it believes would improve levels of literacy and numeracy. TheLib Demshave pledged toprotect the ""triple lock"" on state pensions. This guarantee, introduced by the 2010 coalition government, sees the state pension rise in line with wages, inflation or by 2.5% - whichever is highest. The party would scrap annual winter fuel payments for retired people in the 40% tax bracket to pay for it. Labourhas also pledge to retain the ""triple lock"". It would also amend company takeover rules to protect employees' pensions. Theresa May has declined opportunities to confirm theConservativeswould guarantee the ""triple lock"", so far. The Tories have pledged toincrease the powers of regulators over company pensions, including fines for employers who deliberately underfund schemes. Labourhas pledged torecruit 10,000 new police officersin England and Wales. TheLib Demsplan a move away from short sentences, which they claim are ineffective, to non-custodial alternatives. TheLib Demswould introduce a month's paid parental leave for fathers. TheWomen's Equality Partyis offeringfree childcare. TheConservativeshave ruled out a rethink on the current system for restricting child benefit for people earning over Â£50,000. TheConservativesarepromising a ""new generation"" of social housing in England, funded by Â£1.4bn already set aside for infrastructure spending. The plans involve offering ""fixed term"" council houses to be sold off after 10 to 15 years, with any proceeds reinvested in social housing. Labourwouldbuild a million new homes over five years. Half would be council and housing association homes which would be ""for rent and totally affordable"". There would also benew legal standards for rented homes, with landlords who fail to meet minimum standards facing fines of up to Â£100,000. TheLib Demswould introduce a Housing Investment Bank to generate funding for new homes. TheGreen Partywould introduce rent controls, build 500,000 socially-rented affordable homes and introduce a Landlord Licensing Scheme to ensure that every landlord must adhere to minimum standards. TheConservativeshavepromised the biggest expansion of workers' rightsunder their leadership, with pledges to keep all workers' rights currently guaranteed by EU law, put worker representation on company boards and protect pensions. There would also be a statutory right to a year's unpaid leave to care for a relative. Labourhas a20-point plan to end the ""rigged economy"" in the workplace,external, which includes giving all workers equal rights from day one, a ban on zero-hours contracts; guaranteeing trade unions a right to access workplaces, ending the public sector pay cap, raising the minimum wage, banning unpaid internships, abolishing employment tribunal fees, and increasing and extending paternity pay. It also plans tointroduce a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour, and to introducefour new UK-wide bank holidays. TheLib Demsplan to introduce mandatory reporting on the ethnicity pay gap for organisations with 250 employees or more. The party haspledged to scrap the public sector pay cap, which limits pay rises for workers to 1% per year until 2020. Labourplans to reduce the number of people sleeping rough bydoubling the number of homes available for use by homeless people. Four thousand new flats and homes would be ring-fenced for rough sleepers in cities such as Bristol, Liverpool and Birmingham. The carer's allowance would be increased by an extra Â£10 a week - a 17% increase. The two-child limit on child benefit would be scrapped. The Winter Fuel Allowance and free bus passes for pensioners would be retained. TheLib Demswant to end rough sleeping in Britain by placing long-term homeless people straight into independent homes rather than emergency shelters, and increasing grants to local authorities to fund homelessness prevention services more effectively. The party would also reverse cuts to universal credit, and abolish the work capability assessment. The party would also introduce civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. TheConservativeswould hold a free vote on overturning the ban on fox hunting UKIPwouldban Sharia courts and the wearing of face coverings in public places, which it argues are ""a deliberate barrier to integration and in many contexts, a security risk too"". It would also introduce annual school-baseÂ­d medical checks on gÂ­irls from groups at hÂ­igh risk of sufferingÂ­ female genital mutilation. TheConservativesplana cap on gas and electricity billsfor households that pay standard variable tariffs. Analysis: How might an energy cap work? Theresa May hasruled out cuts to the UK foreign aid budgetunder theConservatives, saying the commitment to spending 0.7% of national income on aid ""will remain"". TheLib Demswould replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with a proportional voting system, extend the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, and introduce a democratically-elected upper chamber. TheGreen Partywould alsoextend the voteto 16-year-olds. The Conservatives have ruled out lowering the voting ageat UK elections, with Theresa May saying this is one of those questions ""where you have to draw a line"". UKIPwant postal voting on demand to be scrapped, with applicants having to demonstrate a genuine need before a postal vote is granted. TheGreen Partywould ban fracking, scrap plans for all new nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point C, create a Green Investment and Innovation Centre to help secure finance for a transition to a low-carbon economy, set up an energy system with progressive tariffs so people who use less energy pay less per unit than the big consumers, retro-fit insulation to nine million homes, and encourage local communities to create energy and municipal heating projects. TheGreen Partywould introduce a new Clean Act, an Environmental Protection Act to safeguard EU laws that protect British nature, wildlife and countryside, a diesel scrappage scheme, a strengthened Clean Air Zone network across the country, a levy on emissions-cheating car manufacturers and a bottle deposit scheme to stop 16 million plastic bottles ending up in the environment every day.

"Thesophisticated propaganda effortsof self-styled Islamic State group include a radio station, magazines, videos and photos - often depicting violent imagery. But earlier this year, there appeared to be a shift in the tone of the messaging from some supporters. Among the new methods of communication: cartoons. Earlier this year, a channel on the messaging app Telegram - and a now-deactivated channel on YouTube - began releasing narrative animated stories which veered away from the brutal and shocking images that so-called Islamic State (IS) had previously been pushing. One, specifically aimed at children, was titled The Ruler and the Brave and told the story of a country that had become disillusioned with its tyrant leader. The leader, the video explained, would lie to his subjects about ""brave men"" who dared to stand up to him. These ""brave men"" turn out to be IS militants. Over the past two years, Islamic State group militants and their supporters have increasingly been facingrestrictions imposed by social media platforms. Telegram, a messaging app which offers encryption, ensuring the privacy of users,has attempted to shut down suspected Islamic State channels in the past,external. Telegram has100 million active monthly users,external, and many of its groups are private. Because of the network's security features, extremist material can be hard to identify. Violent photos and videos on bigger platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are generally removed within days. Earlier this year cartoons which glorified Islamic State ideology began appearing on a pro-IS Telegram channel which remains active. The cartoons were also shared on YouTube in March, and remained on the platform until early this month - only being shut down after the BBC alerted YouTube. Titled ""Soon Inshallah"" - or ""soon, God willing"" - this cartoon shows an IS soldier painting the US White House black. Cartoons like these are more difficult for social media sites to pull down as they are not alerted to them as quickly as violent photographs. While cartoons are less likely to be flagged up than violent photographs, Brendan Koerner, a contributing editor at Wired magazine, says that the use of cartoons may also be due to fewer videos and pictures being produced inside regions controlled by IS forces. ""(Their) ability to produce media content has been degraded due to theirmilitary setbacks,"" he told BBC Trending, ""They are now depending on supporters abroad (outside IS-held territory) to make their content."" You can hear more on this story onBBC Trending on the BBC World Service And for more Trending stories,download our podcast Aside from the cartoons, the members of the channel use the hashtag #SupportEtiquette, advising their supporters to adopt a softer tone when discussing IS ideology with potential new members. They urge followers to ""softly preach to the ignorant and undecided."" This approach is markedly different to IS's usual imposition of its views and strict religious interpretations, and its ruthless punishment of those who disagree. ""They have to find new ways to recruit sympathisers and people willing to move,"" Koerner says. ""One part of that is that they have to set up this image that it is a functioning government, that it provides basic services and justice and that it is a utopia."" The channel's posts and the way its administrator is addressed by members of the group suggest the admin is female, and possibly Egyptian. One post explains that one of the channel's aims is to prove that ""pious"" women (presumably implying the administrator) enjoy high status in the eyes of the group. The channel's material also has an impact outside of Telegram. It has been promoted and praised by high-profile IS supporters online and has been used in publications produced by other prolific pro-IS online media groups. YouTube suspended the channel spreading the pro-IS cartoons after the BBC flagged it up and sent Trending the following statement: ""We take our role in combating the spread of extremist material very seriously. We act quickly to remove flagged content that incites violence and terminate accounts run by terrorist organisations"" Telegram has not responded to requests for comment. In ablog posted in March,external, a Telegram spokesman insisted the network was taking action against extremist content and blamed media outlets for exaggerating the impact of terrorism.

"In Singapore, it's very rare to see pregnant women taking part in rigorous activity outdoors As a growing number of pregnant women are joining prenatal exercises classes, the BBC's Sarah Porter - 34 weeks into her pregnancy - attends a boot camp in Singapore. It's 8.45am on a Saturday and Singapore's Botanic Gardens are alive with people and activity. Local walking groups chat furiously in Mandarin, while gaggles of women push prams, coffees in hand. No-one seems particularly deterred by the rising heat. I'm here to join a brand new exercise group called Mom In Balance. It's a franchise business founded in the Netherlands that specialises in outdoor exercise programmes for pregnant women and new mothers. As I sit and wait for others to arrive, a group of five or six women run by me, overtaking everyone in sight. They are being led by a tall blonde woman wearing a t-shirt that says Mom in Balance. I start to panic a little. I've done a reasonable amount of exercise throughout my pregnancy, including some swimming and a (very little) bit of running. But there is absolutely no way I'll be able to keep up with the group I've just seen sprint past. Jantien from Mom In Balance puts Sarah Porter through her paces Thankfully, a heavily pregnant woman decked out in running gear comes and sits next to me. I'm at the right spot, she tells me, at the right time. The 8am class I've just seen run past is for mothers getting back into shape soon after childbirth. The tall blonde instructor returns to take the 9am class - a group which is now made up of three or four quite visibly pregnant women, together with some others. As we set off on our warm-up, we are already dripping with sweat. As it is far from usual to see groups of pregnant women exercising outside in Singapore, passers-by stop and stare. ""Don't worry, we're famous here,"" one woman says to me. ""Some people even stop to take photos of us."" Despite well-documented studies that show the benefits of exercise during all stages of pregnancy, globally the prenatal exercise industry is relatively new. In fact, while a mass of data is readily available on the $542bn (Â£418bn) world fitness industry, it is very difficult to find any about prenatal classes. For example, the Global Wellness Institute (GWI) reports extensively on the fitness industry, but has no statistics whatsoever on the prenatal sector. Nor could they find any for me, from any country. Mom In Balance's Back in Shape classes for new mothers are more vigorous However, GWI's director of research Beth McGroarty, says the sector is definitely now expanding strongly. ""Programmes are being added at existing fitness centres and there are more prenatal yoga, Pilates and other gentle workouts available,"" she says. ""And given the powerful growth in prenatal fitness programmes, one can assume there will be research on this market in the future."" Founded in 2006, Mom in Balance now has franchises in 11 countries, including the US, Japan and Germany, as it tries to meet increasing demand from mums-to-be. Others look on as Mom in Balance member Emma, 38 weeks pregnant, warms up While the bulk of its 7,000 members are in the Netherlands, founder Esther van Diepen, is aiming to see that figure hit at least 10,000 by the end of this year, as it continues to expand around the world. Here in Singapore, the franchise is just four months old, with 75 active members. Jantien Kroese-van den Berg, a fitness instructor and the country's new Mom in Balance franchise owner, hopes to double those numbers by the end of the year. At 150 Singapore dollars ($108; Â£83) per month for a variety of classes, Jantien says she is expecting to rely more heavily on Singapore's expat community than its locals for the initial growth in numbers. Word of mouth, she hopes, will then see more Singaporeans joining, despite some cultural opposition to pregnant women doing exercises. In Singapore, where the population is about 75% ethnic Chinese, together with minorities including Indians and Malays, it's very rare to see pregnant women en masse taking part in rigorous activity outdoors. Prenatal yoga and Pilates is popular, but not more vigorous exercise. Jantien says: ""There is sometimes a general feeling that you should do nothing because that might be better to hold on to your pregnancy. Jantien wants to grow her Singapore membership numbers to 150 by the end of the year ""The Asian-born ladies in my classes - they all have to defend themselves to their families, even to their friends."" A 2015 researchpaper,externalthat analyses the differences in beliefs, attitudes and intentions towards prenatal exercise between women in China and Australia explains a little of what's behind this. ""In traditional Chinese culture, pregnancy is considered a vulnerable period that requires rest and recuperation, with many antenatal taboos, some of which may contrast with international guidelines on exercise in pregnancy,"" the report says. ""Two relevant taboos intended to avoid spontaneous miscarriage include 'not walking too fast' and 'not walking too often', which have been reported to be adhered to by the majority of Chinese women,"" it continues. But Mom in Balance member Richa Nair, a Singaporean Indian, explains it's not only a traditional Chinese belief that prenatal exercise can be dangerous. ""My friends sounded a bit shocked when I described the exercises we do, but soon that turned to admiration,"" she says. ""With regards to my family, they are mostly horrified and believe this is a time to relax and slow down the pace of life. Their eyebrows shot into their foreheads when I told them about my prenatal exercising."" Dr Ann Tan, a leading obstetrician and gynaecologist in Singapore, says attitudes towards prenatal exercise are definitely changing, though perhaps more slowly in parts of Asia. Like most medical professionals, though, she is guarded with her advice. ""Usually I don't like any high impact in the first trimester. I like walking, you can swim too. But no high impact stuff,"" she says. ""The second and third trimester depends very much on the lady herself. If she's perfectly well and she's been active all her life, then she can actually resume some of her exercise, but tail it down to about 60%."" Singapore-based personal trainer Aaron Rolley, the boss of International Fitness Consultants, has worked with pregnant women for about 20 years. A personal training session with Aaron Rolley doesn't attract quite as much as attention as the Mom in Balance groups Charging 100 Singapore dollars for a one-on-one session, he has built a reputation as a leader in his field. ""Training during pregnancy is not about losing fat or going for a personal best,"" says Aaron. ""The workout for each mother will look very different, some will just stretch, foam roll and mobilise, while others will be doing chin ups and push ups. It depends on the individual and their training history.""

"Thesophisticated propaganda effortsof self-styled Islamic State group include a radio station, magazines, videos and photos - often depicting violent imagery. But earlier this year, there appeared to be a shift in the tone of the messaging from some supporters. Among the new methods of communication: cartoons. Earlier this year, a channel on the messaging app Telegram - and a now-deactivated channel on YouTube - began releasing narrative animated stories which veered away from the brutal and shocking images that so-called Islamic State (IS) had previously been pushing. One, specifically aimed at children, was titled The Ruler and the Brave and told the story of a country that had become disillusioned with its tyrant leader. The leader, the video explained, would lie to his subjects about ""brave men"" who dared to stand up to him. These ""brave men"" turn out to be IS militants. Over the past two years, Islamic State group militants and their supporters have increasingly been facingrestrictions imposed by social media platforms. Telegram, a messaging app which offers encryption, ensuring the privacy of users,has attempted to shut down suspected Islamic State channels in the past,external. Telegram has100 million active monthly users,external, and many of its groups are private. Because of the network's security features, extremist material can be hard to identify. Violent photos and videos on bigger platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are generally removed within days. Earlier this year cartoons which glorified Islamic State ideology began appearing on a pro-IS Telegram channel which remains active. The cartoons were also shared on YouTube in March, and remained on the platform until early this month - only being shut down after the BBC alerted YouTube. Titled ""Soon Inshallah"" - or ""soon, God willing"" - this cartoon shows an IS soldier painting the US White House black. Cartoons like these are more difficult for social media sites to pull down as they are not alerted to them as quickly as violent photographs. While cartoons are less likely to be flagged up than violent photographs, Brendan Koerner, a contributing editor at Wired magazine, says that the use of cartoons may also be due to fewer videos and pictures being produced inside regions controlled by IS forces. ""(Their) ability to produce media content has been degraded due to theirmilitary setbacks,"" he told BBC Trending, ""They are now depending on supporters abroad (outside IS-held territory) to make their content."" You can hear more on this story onBBC Trending on the BBC World Service And for more Trending stories,download our podcast Aside from the cartoons, the members of the channel use the hashtag #SupportEtiquette, advising their supporters to adopt a softer tone when discussing IS ideology with potential new members. They urge followers to ""softly preach to the ignorant and undecided."" This approach is markedly different to IS's usual imposition of its views and strict religious interpretations, and its ruthless punishment of those who disagree. ""They have to find new ways to recruit sympathisers and people willing to move,"" Koerner says. ""One part of that is that they have to set up this image that it is a functioning government, that it provides basic services and justice and that it is a utopia."" The channel's posts and the way its administrator is addressed by members of the group suggest the admin is female, and possibly Egyptian. One post explains that one of the channel's aims is to prove that ""pious"" women (presumably implying the administrator) enjoy high status in the eyes of the group. The channel's material also has an impact outside of Telegram. It has been promoted and praised by high-profile IS supporters online and has been used in publications produced by other prolific pro-IS online media groups. YouTube suspended the channel spreading the pro-IS cartoons after the BBC flagged it up and sent Trending the following statement: ""We take our role in combating the spread of extremist material very seriously. We act quickly to remove flagged content that incites violence and terminate accounts run by terrorist organisations"" Telegram has not responded to requests for comment.

"Recent al-Shabab suicide bombings in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, have targeted the UN, hotels and military leaders This Thursday, the great and the good will descend on London to discussSomalia, a country that has topped theFragile States Index,externalfor eight of the past 10 years. The London Somalia Conference, co-chaired by the UK, Somalia and the United Nations, will be held in Lancaster House, a grand mansion in the exclusive district of St James's. Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby. This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of ""cut and paste"" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy. The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made. But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: ""Chronically unstable and ungoverned"", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine. There has been some improvement. Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (Â£5.4bn) a year, is much diminished, althoughthere has been a recent resurgence. US drones, African Union troops, Western ""security advisers"" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will. A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president,Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament. Somalia is in a ""pre-famine"" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died. But it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference. The country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed. Even before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declaredRepublic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children. Severely malnourished children in Baidoa regional hospital One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. ""His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,"" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. ""He will never recover."" According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening. Most are too sick to go to school or help herd animals, making the life of the country's many nomads even more precarious. People are already dying from hunger and diseases that strike those weakened by lack of food. Severely malnourished children are nine times more likely than healthy ones to die from illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea. The World Health Organization says there were more than 25,000 cases of cholera in the first four months of 2017, with the number expected to more than double to 54,000 by June. More than 500 people have already died from the disease. It is not just humans who are suffering. In Somaliland, officials say, 80% of livestock have died. Livestock is the mainstay of the economy - the ports in Somaliland and nearby Djibouti export more live animals than anywhere else in the world, mainly to the Gulf. Tens of thousands people fleeing drought and al-Shabab live in tents on the outskirts of Baidoa In south-western Somalia, tens of thousands of drought-affected people have fled to Baidoa, clustering into flimsy, makeshift shelters on the outskirts of the city. This area - known as the ""triangle of death"" - was the epicentre of the famines of 2011 and 1991. ""Al-Shabab is harvesting the boys and men we left behind on our parched land, offering them a few dollars and a meal,"" says one woman. ""Against their will, our children and husbands have become the jihadists' new army."" Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? US troops to help fight against al-Shabab ""The biggest problem in dealing with this drought is insecurity,"" says Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, president of South West State, in his modest palace in Baidoa. The city, which is protected by a ring of Ethiopian troops, is right in the heart of al-Shabab country. ""The militants have closed all the roads so we cannot deliver help to those who need it most."" This brings home in the starkest of terms why security is top of the London Somalia Conference agenda. As long as Somalia remains violent, with different parts of the country controlled by a multitude of often conflicting armed groups, it will be impossible to deliver emergency assistance, let alone long-term development. Al-Shabab, which has links to al-Qaeda, is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters The recently created South West State is one of the regions making up the new federal Somalia. Critics fear this will lead to balkanisation, and risks introducing another dimension to conflict, as the new states rub up against each other and start fighting. This has already happened in central Somalia, where last year there were deadly clashes between Puntland and Galmudug states. The attitude of people in South West State shows how much of a gamble the federal system is. ""We have always been marginalised and looked down on by other Somalis,"" says a farmer, Fatima Issa. ""We do not want the federal troops here. They don't hunt down al-Shabab the way our local militias do. We should push for more autonomy, maybe even break away and declare independence like Somaliland did in 1991."" One aim of the London Somalia Conference is to push for more progress on the sharing of resources between the regions and the centre. This contentious issue has been debated since before the first London gathering in 2012. South West State has a special friendship with Ethiopia, which is not on the best of terms with the new federal government. This highlights another possible problem - some foreign powers have started to sign bilateral agreements with regional states. For instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is building a military base in Somaliland, a territory the federal government considers an integral part of Somalia. The UAE has also given military hardware to Jubaland State in southern Somalia. Somalia's former special envoy to the US, Abukar Arman, has described the London Somalia Conference as a ""predatory carnival"", with foreign powers gathering to slice up Somalia for their own benefit. The loss of two Black Hawk helicopters in Somalia in 1993 made the US wary of intervening in African crises Some in Somalia see it as a waste of time. ""It is an expensive talking-shop,"" says Ahmed Mohamed, a rickshaw driver in the capital Mogadishu. ""The politicians and diplomats are obsessed with the conference instead of taking action on the drought."" But lessons have been learned, and there is now a far more nuanced approach to Somalia than there was when the crisis began, in the late 1980s. The US response to the Somali famine of 1991 was to send in nearly 30,000 troops. This ended in a humiliating withdrawal,following the shooting down of two US Black Hawk helicopters in 1993. Now, much of the talk is of ""Somali-owned"" processes, although the shadows of a growing number of foreign powers can be seen lurking in the background.

"MarÃ­a Alvarez says she has been taking part in marches since 2002 Venezuelans angry with the government of President Nicolas Maduro have been taking to the streets almost daily since the beginning of April. Despite dozens of people being killed in protest-related violence, the demonstrations show little sign of abating. Here, demonstrators explain their reasons for protesting, and what they hope will come out of their efforts. There's no freedom of expression here in Venezuela. There's no freedom of any kind. On top of that you have shortages of medicines, of goods. This crisis is affecting my entire family. We have gone from being middle class to being much lower down. Every day we're worse off and our children don't have a future. They're killing our children [at the protests]. I'm here as a mother, not just for the sake of my own children but for the sake of all Venezuelan children and youths who are being unjustly repressed because this dictatorship wants to take over the country. What is behind the crisis? Venezuela sees sharp rise in child deaths A crumbling health system The government portrays the opposition as terrorists. We're really tired of this and that's why we'll keep protesting. There are people who think that just another march won't change anything but I don't think that's true. I believe that if all of us gathered here think that way, we can achieve something. I will continue marching as long as my health allows it.  I'm a breast cancer survivor - I've just come from my check-up and I'm fine, so I will carry on fighting for my children, for my country. ""La Muerte"" (alias meaning death) worries government agents will come looking for him if he shows his face I'm on my 32nd day of protest. I've been here every day, resisting. I've been unemployed for two months because of the situation this country is in. The firm I used to work for left Venezuela. I have two children. Now I do ""bachaqueo"" [buying and selling goods on the black market] to feed them. We're here to put an end to the dictatorship in Venezuela, so that our children can grow up in a free Venezuela. The people of Venezuela have been supporting us, they bring us food and water. They know we're not going to abandon them, we're the resistance of Caracas, we're the resistance of Venezuela. I carry a homemade shield on which I've painted the map of Venezuela. I wear a mask because the Sebin [Venezuelan intelligence service] is looking for us. The police come to search our homes and take us away if they find us. They've already taken some of my friends. A few friends have been killed. More than 30 people have been killed in 35 days of protests. And we're fighting for them. What drives me to protest is what's happened to my sister. She is like a mother to me because she looked after me while my parents, left-wing militants, were doing their thing. She is 38 and she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012. She was getting injections to keep it from growing. That medication was being produced here. Miguel Pizarro protests because medicine shortages affected his sister But in 2014 it stopped being produced in Venezuela and it soon stopped being imported, too. My sister's tumour started growing again and left her paralysed. In 2015, we decided as a family that we needed to get her out of the country. She's now living abroad in a tiny flat as an undocumented immigrant and we send her what we can so she can get the injections, which keep her paralysis in check. I don't want to continue living in a country where I can only see her on the screen of my phone because someone decided to siphon off the money needed to import medication. When I wake up tired of protesting, I remember that day I waved her and my niece off at the airport. You have to turn that pain into fuel, if you don't, it will turn into hate, pain will turn into a wish for revenge, and I'd rather it was a fuel for change. Alba FernÃ¡ndez Torres I've been to all the protests so far and I will carry on going to all of them. It's risky, but if we want freedom for my country and for the children of this country, we have to take some risks. My children, of course, worry about me but they agree with me. They say, ""Carry on mum, we will, too!"" Despite my age I feel the duty and the moral obligation to give the children a free Venezuela, which I knew when I was a student. I demand free elections to change this government that we don't want, this government that has erased the middle class from the map. I worked as an anaesthetist and as a doctor I can tell you the problems are numerous. We don't have supplies. When a patient is going to be operated on, the first thing he is given is a list of the medical supplies he needs to buy, no matter how much it costs, because the hospital has nothing. I have bladder cancer and I haven't been able to have my check-up, which was due in January, because there are no reagents. My diet has suffered, too - now I don't eat half as much of what I used to and it's mainly carbohydrates. Where is the protein to give us energy? I'm going to carry on protesting until that man [President Nicolas Maduro] leaves. I don't want violence, but we're going to get him out, of that I'm sure. Two masked protesters who prefer to be known by their collective alias, Los Pedros We're here to topple the government, one way or another. There are people dying of hunger, the currency has dropped in value, we can't buy basic goods and there's a lack of security, which is killing us. My granny can't get the medication she needs. And then, in January last year, my uncle was killed by criminals. That's when I decided to go out and protest, but I knew I wouldn't be allowed to on my own. We talked about it at school one day and decided to all take to the streets together. There are about 15 of us, all the same age, and we call ourselves Los Pedros. We don't have classes at the moment anyway because of the protests so we may as well come here. This is my fifth protest. Our parents know we're here. They do worry, but we're doing it for Venezuela. We saw what happened with the protests in Ukraine and we think it can work here. All photographs by Alejandro Cegarra.
