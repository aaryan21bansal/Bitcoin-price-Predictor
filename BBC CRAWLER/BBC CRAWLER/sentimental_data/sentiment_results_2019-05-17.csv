"Talks between Labour and the government aimed at breaking the Brexit impasse have ended without an agreement. Jeremy Corbyn said the discussions had ""gone as far as they can"", blaming what he called the government's ""increasing weakness and instability"". Theresa May said the lack of a ""common position"" within Labour over a further referendum had made talks ""difficult"". The prime minister said she would now consider putting options to MPs on Brexit that may ""command a majority"". But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the end of the talks a ""very negative development"". Watson: PM's plan might not be dead yet Pienaar: PM's steady diet of faint hope Pound hits four-month low as talks end Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May has promised to set a timetable for leaving Downing Streetfollowing a House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March - but after MPs voted down the deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc three times, the EU gave the UK an extension until 31 October. This prompted negotiations between the Conservatives and Labour to see if the parties could come to a Brexit agreement, despite differences over issues including membership of a customs union and a further referendum. The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Read the full article But in a letter to the prime minister, Labour leader Mr Corbyn wrote: ""I believe the talks between us about finding a compromise agreement on leaving the European Union have now gone as far as they can."" The move towards choosing her replacement meant ""the position of the government has become ever more unstable"". He later said his party had negotiated ""in good faith and very seriously, and put forward a lot of very detailed arguments"", which he thought was ""the responsible thing to do"". He added: ""The issue [is] that the government has not fundamentally shifted its view and the divisions in the Conservative Party mean the government is negotiating with no authority and no ability that I can see to actually deliver anything."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Government hasn't shifted its view Speaking after meeting Tory activists in Bristol, Mrs May said: ""There have been areas where we have been able to find common ground, but other issues have proved to be more difficult. ""In particular, we haven't been able to overcome the fact that there isn't a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum to reverse it."" She said the government would consider what had come out of the meetings with Labour and ""consider whether we have some votes to see if the ideas that have come through command a majority in the House of Commons"". This video can not be played Theresa May: There isn't a common position in Labour for Brexit Labour's favoured plan includes a permanent customs union with the EU, meaning no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods sold between the UK and the rest of the bloc. It also keeps the option of a further referendum on the table, giving the public a say on the deal agreed by Parliament. Both scenarios have caused anger among Brexit-backing Conservatives, who claim a customs union would prevent the UK from negotiating its own trade deals around the world after leaving the EU, and who believe another public vote is undemocratic. Some MPs have also criticised Mrs May for even entering into talks with Labour, but the prime minister said the government had ""no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons"". Before the talks with Labour, the prime minister - whose Conservative Party does not have a majority in the Commons - failed to get her deal through three times, by margins of 230, 149 and 58 votes. The DUP, whichsupports her government on certain issues,opposes Mrs May's agreement with the EU over its implications for Northern Ireland. Following the collapse of the discussions with Labour, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""This round of talks has wasted time rather than making progress and reducing uncertainty. It was always doomed to failure."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM was ""trying to blame everyone but herself for the collapse of cross-party talks"". He tweeted: ""She knows the reality is she couldn't carry her own side or offer a realistic compromise. Any deal agreed wouldn't last a day under a new Tory leader."" But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government had moved in some areas - specifically on workers' rights and environmental standards - and had been ""having discussions around where we were on customs arrangements"". He said senior Labour figures like Sir Keir had been insisting on a further referendum on any deal, adding: ""It begs the question why have they taken six [or] seven weeks for talks?"" Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable criticised both of the main parties, tweeting: ""The weakness of the government and the vacillation of the Labour Party put their talks on very shaky ground from the beginning."" The director general of the CBI business group, Carolyn Fairbairn, called the end of the talks ""another day of failed politics"" and ""another dispiriting day"". She called for Parliament's recess at the end of this month to be cancelled, adding: ""This is no time for holidays. It's time to get on with it."" On Thursday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson became the latest MP to put his name forward as a possible successor to Mrs May. Asked by reporters on Friday if he would be running for the leadership, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it was now time for colleagues to ""focus"" on delivering Brexit.

"Bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament is the last roll of the dice for the prime minister Labour has finally pulled the plug on the Brexit talks with the government, at the end of a week in which they appeared to be on life support. So is it, as some suggest, time to read the last rites on Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Let's be clear - it will be challenging, to say the least, for the legislation to get through the Commons. But reports of its demise may well have been exaggerated. It may not go down to immediate defeat. And this is why. A leaked memo from the government side, not agreed by Labour or the cabinet, contained a wheeze that could have been attractive to both leaderships. Even before the Withdrawal Agreement Bill makes its appearance, the memo suggested there could be a ""free vote"" in Parliament on another referendum. Labour-Tory Brexit talks end without deal Pound hits four-month low as Brexit talks end Brexit: What happens next? This is rather different from what the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, was suggesting - that there ought to be a ""confirmatory"" vote, as part of a package, on any agreed deal. The leaders of both the main parties aren't keen on another public vote, to say the least. So a stand-alone Commons vote on the issue, divorced from the deal, would be more likely to go down to defeat - as it has on previous occasions. Jeremy Corbyn could say to People's Vote supporters in his ranks: ""Oh, I did try for a referendum, but oops, it didn't work - so now let's just leave with the best possible deal."" But it would seem that this approach has been scuppered by Labour's wider negotiating team and, presumably, by the cabinet. I have had a strong steer that this proposal in the leaked government memo won't go ahead in this form. But this might not be the setback it seems for the prime minister because supporters of another referendum may have no option but to vote initially for her bill. There will be a vote at what's called, in parliamentary speak, second reading in the first week in June. If the prime minister is defeated at this point, it's basically the end of the road for her deal and her premiership. Theresa May's immediate fate could be in the hands of Labour MPs But if MPs vote for the bill at second reading, they then get an opportunity to change it - and that would include an amendment on another referendum. So it's not impossible that some people who hate Theresa May's deal give it their temporary backing so they can discuss improving it, or putting it to a public vote. Talks with Labour are over - but efforts to win over individual Labour MPs are not. Note the wording of Downing Street's statement that ""complete agreement"" hasn't been reached. So expect to see some incentives in - or around - the Brexit bill for opposition MPs to back the government. For example, a commitment to stay in step with the EU on workers' rights and environmental protection. Allies of Sir Keir have blamed the breakdown of the talks on the PM's inability to get a customs union compromise past her cabinet. But if she keeps Conservative MPs on board in the legislation by eschewing a customs union but delivers a ""comprehensive"" (trust me, this word is important to some Labour MPs) temporary arrangement to last until the next election, some soft opposition to her deal may crumble. Then there is the argument put forward by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles, echoed off the record by some in Downing Street. If the prime minister's bill gets shot down in flames there is no other readily available vehicle to prevent the default option of no deal. Indeed, No 10 insiders expect to see ""vociferous"" arguments for no deal if Theresa May's legislation falls. Some unions, such as the GMB and Unison, favour another referendum. But the leadership of Unite, which is closest to Mr Corbyn, essentially favours leaving with a deal - and Labour MPs will be made well aware of this. So even if Labour formally opposes the bill at second reading, there could be a sizeable rebellion from those former Remainers representing Leave areas - safe in the knowledge that they wouldn't exactly be upsetting some powerful forces in the party. And the MPs who support what's called Common Market 2.0 could be crucial to the outcome. These are, broadly speaking, Labour MPs who are neither Corbynistas nor in favour of another referendum - such as Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock - and they are very keen to avoid no deal. However, if the Labour whip is to oppose, expect it to be rigorously enforced irrespective of the views of the party leader's office. So Mrs May's immediate fate may still be in the hands of opposition MPs The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Set against all this, there is plenty of analysis in the public domain which will tell you how impossible it is for a deal to go through. But right now, No 10 might well see ""highly improbable"" as grounds for optimism. Hope dies last, does it not?

"Officials will visit more than 3,000 remote locations before Saturday's election In a vast, sparsely populated land like Australia, overseeing an election is a massive logistical effort... particularly when you have compulsory voting. The task is greater than ever ahead of Saturday's general election because a record 96.8% of eligible voters have enrolled to cast a ballot. Most Australians will vote in cities and regional centres, but many simply cannot get to those places. To ensure everyone gets a say, election officials are visiting more than 3,000 remote locations over 12 days. It's a sprawling, ambitious undertaking that involves travel by air, sea and land - sometimes to set up a single ballot box. Here are four of the most challenging locations to reach. ""If we get a request and can fit it, we'll go out to them,"" says electoral officer Geoff Bloom. His team charters boats, planes, 4x4s and helicopters to visit 200 remote communities in the Northern Territory. In many indigenous communities, where English isn't the first (or second) spoken language, an interpreter accompanies the election officials. More than 200 languages are spoken, but his team speaks only the most widely used. Two voters outside Gunbalanya, Northern Territory, in 2010 Larger communities have 2,000-2,500 residents; the smallest his team visits are out-stations with four or five homes and just 10 electors on the roll. But they'll still visit - helicopters travel to up to three communities in a day. Although voting in suburban Australian towns typically involves a sausage sizzle, in the remote communities he visits, ""democracy sausages"" are less likely. How Australia is changing - in 11 charts Is cash king in Australia's elections? Australian PM hit by egg on campaign trail ""Some [people] are off hunting and fishing when we arrive,"" he says. But nonchalance is less common than engagement: ""Often, community members are waiting patiently for us. This is important to them because of the hard-fought right to vote."" Indigenous Australians weren't granted the right to vote until 1962, and indigenous enrolment rate today is lower than the general population, at 76.4%. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has been sending mobile voting teams out to remote indigenous communities since 1984. The places visited, such as Arnhem Land, are often so remote, postal services are unreliable or not commonly used, which is why AEC representatives undertake remarkable journeys to reach them. ""One of my team recently travelled 100km [60 miles] on a dirt road to a small community,"" Mr Bloom says. Voters line up in Warruwi, Northern Territory, in 2013 ""Torrential rain had washed the road out - rivers ran across it. They still got there - just 90 minutes late."" Yes, really. Forty-nine Australian expeditioners are registered ""Antarctic electors"" in 2019. They're a mix of technicians, tradespeople and scientists. More than 500 Australians go south to Antarctica every year. Travel is possible only between October and March, via an icebreaker ship or a plane which lands on an ice runway. Voting in the Australian general election even takes place in Antarctica Outside of those months, numbers drop right down; there are currently 74 Australians there. They'll stay for 12-14 months. Ballot boxes are already at the stations, which are recognised as official polling places under Australian legislation. At each station, an expeditioner is appointed Antarctic Returning Officer. Mark Horstman from the Australian Antarctic Division tells the BBC: ""There's no way for ballot boxes to be transported between Antarctica and Australia. The voting procedure is completely paper-based. Once the poll closes, the returning officer reads each vote over the phone."" There are at least 274 Torres Strait islands off Australia's northern coast; 17 are inhabited. A total of 4,231 Torres Strait Islanders have registered to vote this year. That's 16 more than in the 2016 election. Officially, the islands are part of Queensland - so AEC staff travel out to many of these islands, too. But before they do, they must write to the traditional owners of the land and ask permission to visit. Masig Island, one of an estimated 274 Torres Strait islands It's granted with enthusiasm, says David Stuart, who runs the indigenous electoral participation programme, and says three teams will head out by boat and helicopter. And they face particular challenges when they're there. ""When you're flying around, they look picture postcard perfect. But on the ground they can be very tropical, windswept and absolutely torrential. We have to waterproof everything."" To give a sense of how far the islands are from metropolitan Australia, from some of the more northern ones, he says, you can actually see Papua New Guinea. It isn't just indigenous communities that are remote in Australia - the AEC also sends out representatives to rural farms and mining sites such as Leinster - a remote mining village of 500 residents, 1,000km north-east of Perth. Only employees of mining company BHP live there. According to Mr Bloom, fewer miners attend polling booths than used to be the case: ""The postal vote tends to be their preference, so we're not mobile polling them as much these days."" Remote mines and farms are visited by Australian election officials to make voting accessible to everyone They could be missing out on election day fun, though. ""One of my team leaders was setting up in central Queensland and a dog was under the table,"" Mr Bloom says. ""They set up the booth around it, not wishing to wake it from relaxing in the sun. ""Then suddenly someone shouted, 'There's a dingo under the table!' The issuing officer jumped up and knocked the electronic tablet into the dirt! ""The dingo woke up, and ran off."" Dingoes, flooded roads, interpreters: nothing deters these teams from encouraging voting. ""As far as voting options go, we're one of the most open and accessible systems in the world,"" says the AEC's Evan Ekin-Smyth.

"Sarah Hanson-Young called out a sexist slur yelled at her in parliament last year Australian women in politics have had enough. A slew of allegations of sexist bullying and misogyny have emerged in recent years, while at the same time the country has steadily tumbled down the global rankings for female political representation. Australia has tended to favour ""larrikin"" and ""aggressor"" MPs who thrive in the ""rough-and-tumble"" atmosphere of Canberra. But women MPs are increasingly saying that's a culture in dire need of change. As the country prepares to go to the polls on Saturday, the BBC looks at what's come to be known as the ""women problem"" in Australian politics. Sarah Hanson-Young was 25 when she won a seat in Australia's Senate in 2007, the youngest woman ever to do so. The Greens member has always been a forthright voice on progressive issues and women's rights, but she has spoken extensively about how this was against a backdrop of mutterings from male opponents ""about my dress, my body, and my supposed sex life"". She had largely ignored them, choosing the well-trodden path of rising above it all. But an exchange in parliament last year proved the final straw. It happened during a debate on women's safety followinga murder which shocked the nation. A young comedian walking home late at night had been killed by a stranger. Ms Hanson-Young said women wouldn't need extra protection if men didn't rape them. In response, an older male senator called out: ""You should stop shagging men, Sarah."" Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm - known for revelling in his controversial remarks - refused to apologise when confronted by Ms Hanson-Young, who is divorced with a child. He instead repeated his comments and other explicit claims in TV and radio interviews. He accused her of hypocrisy. She accused him of ""slut-shaming"" - where slurs about a women's alleged sexual activities are used to demean or silence her. Ms Hanson-Young said her 11-year-old daughter was asked at school whether her mum had ""lots of boyfriends"". Tony Abbott was criticised for standing in front of controversial protest signs while opposition leader in 2011 ""I decided at that moment I'd had enough of men in that place using sexism and sexist slurs, sexual innuendo as part of their intimidation and bullying on the floor of the parliament,"" the senator said in a later interview. She is suing Mr Leyonhjelm for defamation, on the grounds that he had attacked her character by suggesting she was a hypocrite and a misandrist (man-hater), and by repeatedly accusing her of making the claim that all men were rapists. Mr Leyonhjelm has consistently denied defaming her. Ms Hanson-Young says she took the action because she is in a powerful enough position to do so whereas many women who encounter such comments at work are not. ""If we can't clean it up in our nation's parliament, well, where can we do it?"" Australian politics is known to be rambunctious, with plain speaking considered a national trait. But female lawmakers say the comments and treatment they receive can often be explicitly gendered in nature, can border on abuse or intimidation and do not happen to their male counterparts. When one woman sensationally quit the ruling Liberal-led government last year, she sparked something of a groundswell revolt. Australia, a hotspot of political coups, had just witnessed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's ousting by party rivals. Julia Banks felt she had to act after experiencing the vicious infighting. Julia Banks stands to deliver her resignation speech, prompting government MPs to leave the chamber She pointed the finger at the ""scourge of cultural and gender bias,external, bullying and intimidation"" saying: ""Women have suffered in silence for too long."" She was later backed up by other women in the government, including the party's deputy Julie Bishop who described ""appalling"" behaviour. One female senator threatened to name bullies, while the Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer confirmed allegations of bullying and intimidation. Julie Bishop, Australia's most powerful female MP in recent years, criticised ""appalling"" behaviour The Liberal women have scotched suggestions that they're just not up to the ""rough-and-tumble"" of politics, as one of their male colleagues put it. ""The hallmark characteristics of the Australian womanâ¦ are resilience and a strong authentic independent spirit,"" blazed Ms Banks as she moved to the crossbench. For her, it's proof that it's time for parliamentary culture to change. And that the only way to do that is ""equal representation of men and women in this parliament"". When it comes to gender diversity, Australia's parliament is flagging. Women - crucially, excluding indigenous Australians and most women of colour - first won the right to run in federal elections in 1902. But it took four decades - and 29 other countries do it first - before Australian women would actually win seats. They have always won more in the Senate because, say experts, it uses proportional voting by state - whereas the lower house has distinct electorates. The current parliament has reached an all-time high for percentage of women MPs. But when it comes to its international standing, Australia has fallen behind. In the past 20 years it's slumped from 15th in the world to 50th for parliamentary gender diversity. Overall, that's partly due to a lack of pressure on both parties, says Dr Jill Sheppard, a political scientist at the Australian National University. A recent Australian Broadcasting Corporation survey,externalfound significant support among women - though not men - for measures to improve the deficit. Labor has such a mechanism. It introduced an affirmative action quota in 1994 and is now close to 50% representation - about double the proportion of women in the government. At Saturday's election, women will contest 31% of its safe seats,according to election analyst Ben Raue,external. The Liberal-National coalition may even see a dip in female representation, some analysts say. The coalition has put up women in only 16% of its safe seats, Mr Raue says. ""The Liberal Party is the drag here,"" says Dr Sheppard, when asked about the nation's fall in global diversity rankings. She says the party tends to view its successful women ""as almost unicorns - tremendous women who can't be replicated"". The party is seeking parity by 2025, but it is ideologically resistant to the idea of mandatory quotas and wants change to happen more organically. ""We don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse,"" said party leader and Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, in a speech on International Women's Day. He drew considerable criticism for the remarks, which were seen as implying men shouldn't lose out to allow women to move up. This is not a new issue for women in Canberra. Natasha Stott Despoja joined parliament in 1995 at age 26, when women made up just 14% of the room. Natasha Stott Despoja with her baby in her parliamentary office In her 13 years as a senator, during which she became leader of the Australian Democrats, sexism was ""endemic"" in the political culture, she says. ""It ranged from male senators saying to me 'you really should wear skirts' to another senator referring to me only as 'mother' once I had children,"" she told the BBC. After leaving parliament, she went on to be Australia's representative advancing women's rights around the world. She observed other nations' progress while watching the harassment continue at home. ""The single biggest disappointment for me has been the slow pace of change,"" she says. Many thought Australia had turned a corner when Julia Gillard became the first female prime minister in 2010. Ms Gillard achieved many reforms in a tough three years of minority government. But her seizure of the top job - ousting Kevin Rudd in a party coup - haunted her reputation and public legitimacy. Julia Gillard in her final speech as PM in 2013 after losing a leadership contest Opponents and some media regularly portrayed her as a Lady Macbeth figure - a characterisation that invokes latent fears about ambitious women. Debate over policies like a contentious carbon tax often degenerated into personal and gendered attacks. She was ""routinely demonised"" for being unmarried and ""childless"" in office, say Associate Prof Cheryl Collier from the University of Windsor and Associate Prof Tracey Raney from Ryerson University, both in Canada. Such terms ""are rarely if ever used to describe male heads of state"", they say in a 2018 report which compared the treatment of women MPs in Australia, UK and Canada. Throughout her time in power the prime minister was called by her critics and opponents: ""a lying cow"" ""a menopausal monster"" ""deliberately barren"" a ""bitch"" and ""Ju-liar"" The fixation with her appearance at times was unashamedly lewd - a Liberal party fundraising dinner included a ""Julia Gillard"" menu item with explicit references to parts of her body. It also descended into violent imagery - one TV commentator said Australians ""ought to be out there kicking her to death"". Another high-profile radio host said she should be ""put into a chaff bag and thrown into the sea"". The academics suggest the vitriol was so intense because Ms Gillard challenged the Australian stereotype of a good leader. ""Even women who have reached the top of the political ladder are working within an institution that privileges masculinity,"" say Prof Collier and Prof Raney. In 2012, Ms Gillard confronted the sexist, misogynistic attacks in a searing speech in parliament. It reverberated around the world, and to this day girls in Young Labor can quote it like a chant. This video can not be played Julia Gillard accuses Tony Abbott of a long history of misogyny and sexism But in her final speech as prime minister, after she had been removed by her party, she was stoic about the impact her gender had had on her time in office. ""It doesn't explain everything, it doesn't explain nothing, it explains some things. And it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey."" So is the problem just how things are done in parliament, or is it a wider issue about Australian culture? It's telling that the most senior female politicians in the past decade - Ms Gillard from Labor and Julie Bishop, a former Liberal deputy - do not have children. In a country the size of Australia, parliamentary life for MPs based far from Canberra is especially taxing on families, a challenge which tends to be particularly hard for women to overcome. In the past year, several MPs - including Ms O'Dwyer but also a male MP - left parliament saying the job was incompatible with family life. Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer (carrying the baby) quit politics in January But Dr Sonia Palmieri, a gender politics researcher at the50/50 by 2030 Foundation,external- which wants to ""achieve gender parity in leadership"" - says unacknowledged bias remains the fundamental problem. ""Our system always seems to assume that our political actors are gender neutral - when in fact they revolve around standards which are masculine and of course that excludes and shuts out women,"" she says. Dr Palmieri argues this is partly because of specific notions of good political leadership in Australia. She suggests there are roughly two types of accepted leader styles. The first is the idea of the ""larrikin"" politician, a unique Australian term for a boisterous person - usually a man - whose bad behaviour is excused as disregard for convention. Former prime ministers Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam were known for their 'big' personalities Larrikins are seen as endearing in Australian culture, argues Dr Palmieri. There remains a cultural fascination with leaders such Prime Minister Bob Hawke - who could famously down a beer in seconds, and joked that the nation's workers deserved a day off after a landmark sporting victory. The second accepted leader is the aggressor - the acerbic politician revered for their ability to cut down the other side in parliamentary debate. Prime ministers such as Paul Keating and Tony Abbott were noted for their attacking rhetoric in parliamentary debates although their styles widely differed. Gillard's successor, Tony Abbott, often displayed his sporty masculinity Larrikins and aggro fit within the wider stereotypes of Australian identity, says political researcher Blair Williams from the Australian National University. ""We have these models of football players, surf lifesavers, that sort of blokey masculinity that someone like Tony Abbott definitely displayed. But it leaves women out."" Aggression and even ambition are seen as unbecoming in women, says Dr Palmieri. She too points to Ms Gillard, who was not only attacked for how she attained power - despite previous male leaders having seized control that way - but then wasn't given the opportunity to show a different model of leadership to the public. Julia Gillard made a point of visiting a pub while campaigning for election in 2010 Some have also pointed out double standards in the treatment of Emma Husar, a Labor MP forced to resign last year after a news story made a salacious sexual harassment claim. The report broke mistreatment claims, but focused on the MP's sex life. Ms Husar, a single mother, later said the ""slut-shaming smears"" ended her career. Her party asked her to step down less than two days after the report, she said. A subsequent Labor investigation found no evidence of sexual harassment, but said ""complaints that staff were subjected to unreasonable managementâ¦ have merit"".

Dr Sheppard says both major parties are held back by traditional assumptions about women. Party organisers fast-track men to office while ""throwing obstacles in the path of women candidates"", she says. ""They're not doing it deliberately, rather they're acting on decades of ingrained behaviour and what they're used to."" Men are just seen as the safer option. However, her research shows that women are very electable. Her survey of more than 2,000 Australians in 2018 found that when other markers were equal, women candidates were actually more popular than men. She refers to Scandinavian countries when she suggests that women in politics will become normalised once levels reach 30-40%. This is already the case for Labor, she says, while the Liberal party ""has another 20 years to go"". ""We're not there yet, but what we are seeing in Australia is quite rapid generational shift. ""I hope in 15 to 20 years, it won't even be talked about as an issue."" Does this give hope to young women aspiring to enter politics? In her school years Megan Stevens, 19 harboured ambitions of a career in parliament and is now studying politics at the University of Melbourne. The sexism in Canberra has been off-putting for young women like Megan who are interested in politics But increasingly she feels that she would be ""more comfortable"" working behind the scenes as a political staffer. ""How they treated Julia Gillard really put me off,"" she says. The same goes for Liliana Tai, the University of Sydney student union president and a debating champion who interned at parliament over the summer. She says pursuing a career in ""real"" politics is an almost overwhelming prospect. Ms Tai fears that the cultural change needed to allow someone like her, a young, Chinese-Australian woman, to become an elected representative ""may not be achieved in our lifetime"". ""People think of leaders as what they're familiar with and what they know and historically that's been predominantly male, predominantly Anglo people,"" she says. Liliana Tai is the student union president at the University of Sydney She believes that both parties still cater towards stereotypes in selecting candidates. ""I think they fixate so much on electability that they prioritise what they think people want and that leads to a pernicious cycle of not having change."" ""But you need to be a bit brave, and go out on a limb and give that new person a chance."" Last year, the failed leadership bid by the government's most powerful woman, Julie Bishop, proved to Ms Tai that merit isn't enough. Ms Bishop was deputy to four successive male party leaders over 11 years. An MP for two decades, she also served as Australia's first female foreign minister. Julie Bishop (in white) has long featured on the front bench of Liberal coalition government But she resigned from the front bench last year after losing a leadership battle to Scott Morrison. Her prospects were dashed by colleagues who tactically voted to keep another man out. The Australian Financial Review called her: ""The female Prime Minister who never was"". On the day of her resignation, she wore scarlet heels. Ms Bishop donated her famous pair of heels to a democracy museum Whatever the politics of the events, a photograph of the lavish shoes, amid a sea of brogues and dark suits, became an iconic image of a lone woman cut out of power. Australia's Museum of Democracy later exhibited the shoes, along with the photo, which they said were ""a bold statement and a symbol of solidarity and empowerment among Australian women"". Ms Tai says she also took some hope from Ms Bishop's departure. She mentions her final parliamentary speech, where the outgoing MP said public office was ""one of the highest callings"". ""I really resonated with that because that's what I believe too,"" says Ms Tai. ""Being in parliament is still the best way to represent people and bring about change.""

"Kirsty Boden, 28, from Australia, was working as a senior nurse at Guy's Hospital A young woman was killed in the London Bridge attack after she ran to the aid of another victim, telling her friends, ""I'm a nurse, I have to go and help"", an inquest has heard. Kirsty Boden, 28, was stabbed in the head as she knelt over restaurant waiter Alexandre Pigeard as he lay dying, the Old Bailey heard. Footage of her being set upon was shown at the inquest into the deaths of those killed in the London Bridge attack. Eight people died on 3 June 2017. Australian Ms Boden, dubbed the ""angel of London Bridge"", had been out for a meal with two friends when she heard the three attackers' van crash into the railings above and debris falling onto the outside tables. Gareth Patterson QC, the lawyer for her family, said Ms Boden got up within seconds of the crash. The off-duty nurse, who worked at Guy's Hospital, was thinking of others rather than her own safety, he said. A statement from Ms Boden's friend, Melanie Schroeder - one of the friends she was dining with - was read out to the jury on Friday. Ms Schroeder, who had previously asked Ms Boden to be her bridesmaid at her wedding, said: ""Kirsty jumped up and said, 'I'm a nurse. I have to go and help. I need to see if they need help'. ""Kirsty headed off and I thought nothing of it,"" she said. Ms Schroeder said she then remembered hearing screaming and thinking people should calm down because it was ""just a crash"". The friends fled the restaurant with the other diners, and when they returned Ms Schroeder said she saw Ms Boden's body on the ground, which she recognised ""because of her bright pink cardigan"". Ms Boden, who had suffered stab wounds, was alive but unable to speak, Ms Schroeder said. Ms Schroeder and a GP tried to revive her friend, while Ms Mooney attempted to find emergency medical help, but Ms Boden died at their side. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened BBC reporter Hanna Yusuf, at the inquest Dreams, hopes and friendships were terminated on the night Australian nurse Kirsty Boden lost her life. The courtroom watched in awe as footage of a selfless Ms Boden getting up from her dinner with friends - to help victims after hearing a crash - was played. The clips illustrated a night that violently broke up the friendship trio of Ms Boden, Melanie Schroeder and Harriet Mooney. In statements read aloud, Ms Schroeder and Ms Mooney emotively described the night during which they saw their friend die. The desperation in their attempts to save the life of their friend, who was supposed to be Ms Schroeder's bridesmaid, was palpable. There was a collective shudder as the court watched the moment Khuram Butt made a stabbing motion at a faint figure identified as Ms Boden. The court was reminded that the breakdown of moments that seemed lifelong, and were life-changing, happened over a matter of seconds in real time. The inquest heard how Ms Boden was set upon by all three attackers - Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. The three had crashed their car on London Bridge before running through Borough Market. They were shot dead near the market around 10 minutes after their attack began. Lawyer Mr Patterson said the tip of a knife carried by attacker Butt, 27, was later found embedded in Ms Boden's head. The jury heard an account from witness Alexandre Colou, who said he saw the moment Ms Boden fell as crowds of people fled the attackers. ""Her eyes were moving wildly,"" he said. ""She had difficulties breathing. I was talking to her and then her eyes stopped moving. ""I said 'stay awake, stay awake, stay with me'."" Australian au pair Sara Zelenak was beinghelped up by a passer-by after slipping over in her high heels when they were both fatally stabbed. The first person stabbed in the attack, Richard Livett, describedcoming ""nose to nose"" with attacker Khuram Butt, who shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" in his face before stabbing him in the back. PC Mia Kerr recalled howshe discovered victim Sebastien Belanger lying in the streetand used her baton to protect other members of the public from the attackers. Off-duty nurse Helen Kennett told how she asked one of the London Bridge attackerswhat was wrong with himbefore he stabbed her in the neck. She survived the attack. The inquest also heard from British Transport Police constable, Wayne Marques,who previously spoke to the BBCabout being the first officer to confront all three of the attackers. At the inquest, PC Marques told of how he had been on patrol, armed with only a baton, when he ran to the aid of Marie Bondeville, her boyfriend Oliver Dowling, and Richard Livett. He said he was initially alerted by a woman's scream and people running up and down Borough High Street. As he went to investigate, he told the court he was approached by a man running, before finding Richard Livet lying in a pool of blood. He then noticed a man grabbing Ms Bondeville and told the court how the attacker appeared to punch her three or four times, before she fell to the floor, face down. PC Marques then described the moment he saw Mr Dowling being stabbed in the neck. He said: ""I got my baton out and charged the first attacker... my intention was to hit him as hard as I could with all my weight behind me with everything I had. I knew he was trying to kill the man on the floor."" PC Marques said as the first attacker began to ""crumble"" the officer felt an ""almighty blow"" to his head - which impaired his vision. He said: ""At this point I saw a knife coming towards me. Through instinctive reaction I defended myself."" The officer said ""a messy fight"" ensued with the second attacker, before the third ran over. Although PC Marques was stabbed multiple times, he said: ""My job at that stage was to hold on and keep them fighting until the cavalry arrived."" Evidence has so far been heard in relation to six of the victims:Xavier Thomas,Chrissy Archibald,Sara Zelenak,Sebastien Belanger,James McMullanandAlexandre Pigeard.

"The US has reached a deal with Canada to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in a move that could lead to approval for a new North American trade deal. In a joint statement, the US and Canada announced that a 25% tariff on steel imports, and of 10% on aluminium, will end in 48 hours. It is widely expected the US and Mexico will make a similar announcement soon. The US implemented the tariffs last year on grounds of ""national security"". Under the agreement, there will be no quotas on how much steel or aluminium the three countries buy from overseas. USMCA trade deal: Who gets what from 'new Nafta'? A quick guide to the US-China trade war US tariffs: Steel and aluminium levies slapped on key allies However, the US and Canada will monitor imports and if a country is determined to be buying in too much, one of the other nations can request a consultation and potentially re-impose tariffs. Getting rid of the tariffs is viewed as a key hurdle to approval for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal which was signed in 2018.  It replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. Providing that Washington and Mexico City also announce an agreement to lift levies on steel and aluminium, the US, Mexico and Canada will ask their respective governments to ratify USMCA. Canada also announced that it would lift tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium that it implemented last year in retaliation for the Trump administration's levies. Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The spotlight had been on rising trade tensions between the US and China. So America's decision to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium coming from Canada and Mexico was a surprise bit of good news. (L-R) Mexico's then President Enrique Pena Nieto, US President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the USMCA deal As it holds the line with China, the US is now pushing forward with a trade deal much closer to home. Remember the USMCA trade agreement - meant to replace NAFTA? No? Hardly a surprise. It has been languishing in the background. For almost a year now these tariffs had been an obstacle to ratification of the deal. Canada and Mexico had vowed not to move ahead as long as they were in place.  And several members of Congress had also raised objections. This now raises the odds of it crossing the finishing line, opening up a new era of trade expansion in North America. For Mr Trump, who loves tariffs so much he called himself the 'tariff man', this would be a big win. And who knows, trade peace in North America might even strengthen his hand in negotiations with China. It also targeted US farm goods as well as items like tomato ketchup and household products. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: ""These tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border. As we look at moving forward with the new NAFTA, it didn't make a lot of sense to continue to have tariffs on steel and aluminium between our countries."" European Union steel and aluminium exports to the US are still subject to the tariffs, but there has been some good news for trade relations between the two - on Friday President Donald Trump delayed a decision on whether to impose levies on cars and car part imports. The White House has put back the decision by six months to allow more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. Tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and car parts were under consideration. A report by the Commerce Department claimed that imports of foreign-made cars and auto parts into the US were a threat to national security. The report has not been published, but in Friday's announcement Mr Trump cited its findings which conclude that US carmakers are missing out on revenues to invest in research and development (R&D). It said: ""The lag in R&D expenditures by American-owned producers is weakening innovation and, accordingly, threatening to impair our national security."" The president said he agreed with the study's finding that imported cars and trucks were ""weakening our internal economy"". The deal with Canada, as well as the delay in higher tariffs on EU and Japanese cars and auto parts, come at a critical time for the US and China - the world's two biggest economies. On Monday, Beijing implemented retaliatory tariffs on US imports after Mr Trump imposed levies on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, following a breakdown in trade talks between the two nations. The US President characterised it as a ""little squabble"". However, shortly afterwards, Mr Trump declared a ""national emergency"" to protect US computer networks from ""foreign adversaries"". While the announcement did not name any individual companies, it was widely perceived to be directed at Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, which has faced claims its products could be used by China for surveillance. Huawei has vehemently denied the allegations. Trade war: What will China's next move be?

"Protesters call for a boycott of the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv Germany's parliament has condemned as anti-Semitic a movement calling for a cultural boycott of Israel over its policies towards Palestinians. Lawmakers in the Bundestag said the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) group uses anti-Semitic methods to promote its political goals. The BDS movement described the decision as ""a betrayal of international law"". It comes after the group called for artists to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest held in Tel Aviv this week.

"The shelter was installed as part of a planning development bringing a Home Bargains supermarket to the area A Â£6,000 bus shelter was installed on a road in South Yorkshire despite the street having no bus service. Timetable changes made a month earlier meant buses no longer call on Tickhill Road in Maltby. But rather than remove the bus stop it was upgraded with a roof, bench and information panel. South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) said it was reviewing its installation processes ""to prevent this from happening again"". The bus stop was a simple pole before it was upgraded The shelter installation was approved as part of a planning application for a new Home Bargains store nearby and paid for by the property developer, SYPTE added.

"A woman who changed her name and moved cities to escape the scourge of revenge porn has issued a warning. Mikala Monsoon has waived her right to anonymity as a victim of crime after discovering her images on a website containing folders full of women ""from every city in the UK"". She says enough is enough and she wants the crime taken seriously. Police Scotland are now investigating the file sharing website containing explicit images of women. Mega.nz is a file-sharing website where people can share large collections of images, files and videos. The website says it does not tolerate any illegal activity and its standard procedure is to disable the link and close the user's account. Ms Monsoon was sent a link to the site by a concerned former school friend. The site featured folders named by UK towns and cities She toldBBC Scotland's The Nine: ""There were two links. The first was girls in Scotland and had 146 names - one of which was my old name. ""Some had more images than others. ""There was another folder and instead of 146 names it had every city in the UK as an individual folder with sub-folders inside there. So this could be hundreds or thousands of people."" Ms Monsoon did not give her consent for the photos to be shared and is concerned others may not have either. The photographs were not explicit, and she says she was oddly relieved. ""I was relieved because it was my old name and the photos were old and quite unrecognisable,"" she said. ""But I was very angry for the other people involved. I felt the need to speak out about it because it has happened so many times and some attention should be brought to this. ""It is not being dealt with properly."" The shared content included selfies, but also intimate, nude content. Some of the folders give away full names and locations of the women. Ms Monsoon decided to speak out because it was the latest in a number of incidents she has endured over the past six years. Intimate images taken of her when she was 17 were shared and the pictures kept reappearing in different places. She changed her name by deed poll and started a new life in a different city to escape them. She said: ""I've been featured on many websites, including this new one called Mega. I have been featured on a porn site, and on a forum board on reddit.com, one of the biggest sites on the internet."" She said she has experienced anxiety and felt ashamed and degraded in the past but now she is angry that the issue is not being dealt with properly. ""This first happened when I was very young and I thought my life was over. I worried about my family and what other people would think because the victims are blamed rather than the people spreading it. Lives are being torn apart by this."" Ms Monsoon is trying to help other victims and has set up the websiterevengeonrevengeporn.com,externalto highlight the issue. Through this, women featured on the Mega site have contacted her. ""It does - for many people - follow them around for their entire lives,"" she said. ""It affects their relationships, their careers, their opportunities."" She revealed: ""I've had people message me who are lawyers, nursery school teachers, and they say their lives are going to be ruined by this. And I've had people message me to say their friends have taken their own lives because of things like this. ""This isn't just fun and games and leaking some saucy pictures. This is stuff that will make people lose their entire will to live. It's serious."" Across England, Wales and Scotland, revenge porn is a specific criminal offence.  (Northern Ireland is preparing amendments to include it in its Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill.) It's described as ""the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress"". The offence covers photos or videos showing people engaged in sexual activity which would not usually be done in public, or with their genitals, buttocks or breasts exposed or covered only with underwear. It includes sharing the material as well as posting it online. In England and Wales, the maximum punishment is two years in prison - in Scotland, it's five years. Anyone who discovers they have photos should report it to police. And Ms Monsoon believes those affected have to stop blaming themselves. She said: ""It's not your fault. The shame should rest only with the culprits. ""A lot of the content is taken by someone else, completely unbeknownst to the victim in question. This ties in with all rape culture, and that should be highlighted - consent is being ignored more and more. ""We can't allow them to win."" Det Supt Gordon McCreadie from Police Scotland said: ""Perpetrators often share, or threaten to share images as a way of trying to impose power and control over their victims in what can be an absolute betrayal of trust. There is under-reporting of non consensual sharing of intimate images, perhaps because people may feel embarrassed. ""What I would say to victims is don't be embarrassed - the police are not here to judge the way in which you conduct your personal life. ""Police Scotland remains committed to robustly investigating these matters. We encourage victims to come forward early which will better enable us to get evidence from any devices, or provide support to them, and advise how best to minimise impact.""

"The US has reached a deal with Canada to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in a move that could lead to approval for a new North American trade deal. In a joint statement, the US and Canada announced that a 25% tariff on steel imports, and of 10% on aluminium, will end in 48 hours. It is widely expected the US and Mexico will make a similar announcement soon. The US implemented the tariffs last year on grounds of ""national security"". Under the agreement, there will be no quotas on how much steel or aluminium the three countries buy from overseas. USMCA trade deal: Who gets what from 'new Nafta'? A quick guide to the US-China trade war US tariffs: Steel and aluminium levies slapped on key allies However, the US and Canada will monitor imports and if a country is determined to be buying in too much, one of the other nations can request a consultation and potentially re-impose tariffs. Getting rid of the tariffs is viewed as a key hurdle to approval for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal which was signed in 2018.  It replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. Providing that Washington and Mexico City also announce an agreement to lift levies on steel and aluminium, the US, Mexico and Canada will ask their respective governments to ratify USMCA. Canada also announced that it would lift tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium that it implemented last year in retaliation for the Trump administration's levies. Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The spotlight had been on rising trade tensions between the US and China. So America's decision to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium coming from Canada and Mexico was a surprise bit of good news. (L-R) Mexico's then President Enrique Pena Nieto, US President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the USMCA deal As it holds the line with China, the US is now pushing forward with a trade deal much closer to home. Remember the USMCA trade agreement - meant to replace NAFTA? No? Hardly a surprise. It has been languishing in the background. For almost a year now these tariffs had been an obstacle to ratification of the deal. Canada and Mexico had vowed not to move ahead as long as they were in place.  And several members of Congress had also raised objections. This now raises the odds of it crossing the finishing line, opening up a new era of trade expansion in North America. For Mr Trump, who loves tariffs so much he called himself the 'tariff man', this would be a big win. And who knows, trade peace in North America might even strengthen his hand in negotiations with China. It also targeted US farm goods as well as items like tomato ketchup and household products. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: ""These tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border. As we look at moving forward with the new NAFTA, it didn't make a lot of sense to continue to have tariffs on steel and aluminium between our countries."" European Union steel and aluminium exports to the US are still subject to the tariffs, but there has been some good news for trade relations between the two - on Friday President Donald Trump delayed a decision on whether to impose levies on cars and car part imports. The White House has put back the decision by six months to allow more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. Tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and car parts were under consideration. A report by the Commerce Department claimed that imports of foreign-made cars and auto parts into the US were a threat to national security. The report has not been published, but in Friday's announcement Mr Trump cited its findings which conclude that US carmakers are missing out on revenues to invest in research and development (R&D). It said: ""The lag in R&D expenditures by American-owned producers is weakening innovation and, accordingly, threatening to impair our national security."" The president said he agreed with the study's finding that imported cars and trucks were ""weakening our internal economy"". The deal with Canada, as well as the delay in higher tariffs on EU and Japanese cars and auto parts, come at a critical time for the US and China - the world's two biggest economies. On Monday, Beijing implemented retaliatory tariffs on US imports after Mr Trump imposed levies on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, following a breakdown in trade talks between the two nations. The US President characterised it as a ""little squabble"". However, shortly afterwards, Mr Trump declared a ""national emergency"" to protect US computer networks from ""foreign adversaries"". While the announcement did not name any individual companies, it was widely perceived to be directed at Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, which has faced claims its products could be used by China for surveillance. Huawei has vehemently denied the allegations. Trade war: What will China's next move be?

"EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, has defended his airline's high ticket prices to fly to Madrid for the Champions League final between Tottenham and Liverpool on 1 June. Football fans complained to BBC Radio 5 Live that flights around that date cost Â£1,000 instead of Â£250 normally. But Mr Lundgren said the price was higher than average because there had been an ""enormous"" surge in demand. ""That is actually how the system works,"" he said. Liverpool and Spurs fans in sponsor plea Champions League: Two weddings and a football final Mr Lundgren said 42 million people had flown with the airline over the winter season, with 65% of them paying Â£50 or less. ""The whole pricing picture is very dynamic,"" he said, adding that at peak booking times, EasyJet could fill a plane in six seconds. ""That's how quickly this goes and this is how the system reacts."" Mr Lundgren added: ""I can understand if people think that the prices are high on this occasion, because it is higher than the average. ""But there's no doubt that this was an occasion where the prices went very high because the demand was enormous."" He maintained that in comparison with other airlines, EasyJet was still offering lower prices, despite the huge increase. If you want to fly from Liverpool to Madrid on 31 May, it will cost you Â£750 one-way. There are no flights available on the day of the match itself, while return flights on 2 and 3 June are sold out. For Spurs fans, EasyJet flights from London Gatwick to Madrid are sold out on 1 June, but seats are still available the day before, at prices ranging from Â£350 to Â£750. All return flights are sold out on 2 June, but evening flights are still available on 3 June, with prices starting at Â£510. Seats on early morning flights from London Luton to Madrid on 1 June are selling at Â£750. Returns on 2 June are sold out, but you could come back on 3 June for Â£550. Other airlines are, of course, available. A typical London-to-Madrid economy fare on British Airways on the morning of 1 June will set you back Â£709, but that price drops to just Â£46 for an evening flight - which would get you in too late to see the match. Peter, Liverpool fan I live in Hong Kong, but I'm going to be in the UK on business. I bought my airline ticket on BA from London Heathrow to Madrid immediately after Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final. The tickets had already gone up six-fold within a couple of hours, from about Â£100 to Â£600 return. I'm going the day before and I'm coming back the day after, very early in the morning. It was even difficult to get the hotel. It's just an average hotel by the airport, ordinarily â¬120 a night, and that was â¬600-plus a night. We live in a world of shameless greed, but who, if they could, wouldn't take this opportunity to make money? It's solely about supply and demand. I'm lucky in the fact I can even afford this, but I do not envy the Chelsea and Arsenal fans who will travel to Baku for the Europa League final. Mr Lundgren's comments came after EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss in the same period a year earlier. The airline said cost per seat had gone up 3.9% due to fuel price increases and the impact of currency movements, while revenue per seat had fallen by 6.3% to Â£50.71. Easyjet also said had it suffered from ""the impact of drones at Gatwick in December"", which it said had cost it Â£10m. In April, EasyJet had warned about ""weak"" summer sales amid Brexit uncertainty. In its latest results, the carrier said revenue per seat in the second half of the year would be slightly lower. ""This is not helped by the ongoing negative impact of Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider macroeconomic slowdown in Europe,"" it said.

"Bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament is the last roll of the dice for the prime minister Labour has finally pulled the plug on the Brexit talks with the government, at the end of a week in which they appeared to be on life support. So is it, as some suggest, time to read the last rites on Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Let's be clear - it will be challenging, to say the least, for the legislation to get through the Commons. But reports of its demise may well have been exaggerated. It may not go down to immediate defeat. And this is why. A leaked memo from the government side, not agreed by Labour or the cabinet, contained a wheeze that could have been attractive to both leaderships. Even before the Withdrawal Agreement Bill makes its appearance, the memo suggested there could be a ""free vote"" in Parliament on another referendum. Labour-Tory Brexit talks end without deal Pound hits four-month low as Brexit talks end Brexit: What happens next? This is rather different from what the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, was suggesting - that there ought to be a ""confirmatory"" vote, as part of a package, on any agreed deal. The leaders of both the main parties aren't keen on another public vote, to say the least. So a stand-alone Commons vote on the issue, divorced from the deal, would be more likely to go down to defeat - as it has on previous occasions. Jeremy Corbyn could say to People's Vote supporters in his ranks: ""Oh, I did try for a referendum, but oops, it didn't work - so now let's just leave with the best possible deal."" But it would seem that this approach has been scuppered by Labour's wider negotiating team and, presumably, by the cabinet. I have had a strong steer that this proposal in the leaked government memo won't go ahead in this form. But this might not be the setback it seems for the prime minister because supporters of another referendum may have no option but to vote initially for her bill. There will be a vote at what's called, in parliamentary speak, second reading in the first week in June. If the prime minister is defeated at this point, it's basically the end of the road for her deal and her premiership. Theresa May's immediate fate could be in the hands of Labour MPs But if MPs vote for the bill at second reading, they then get an opportunity to change it - and that would include an amendment on another referendum. So it's not impossible that some people who hate Theresa May's deal give it their temporary backing so they can discuss improving it, or putting it to a public vote. Talks with Labour are over - but efforts to win over individual Labour MPs are not. Note the wording of Downing Street's statement that ""complete agreement"" hasn't been reached. So expect to see some incentives in - or around - the Brexit bill for opposition MPs to back the government. For example, a commitment to stay in step with the EU on workers' rights and environmental protection. Allies of Sir Keir have blamed the breakdown of the talks on the PM's inability to get a customs union compromise past her cabinet. But if she keeps Conservative MPs on board in the legislation by eschewing a customs union but delivers a ""comprehensive"" (trust me, this word is important to some Labour MPs) temporary arrangement to last until the next election, some soft opposition to her deal may crumble. Then there is the argument put forward by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles, echoed off the record by some in Downing Street. If the prime minister's bill gets shot down in flames there is no other readily available vehicle to prevent the default option of no deal. Indeed, No 10 insiders expect to see ""vociferous"" arguments for no deal if Theresa May's legislation falls. Some unions, such as the GMB and Unison, favour another referendum. But the leadership of Unite, which is closest to Mr Corbyn, essentially favours leaving with a deal - and Labour MPs will be made well aware of this. So even if Labour formally opposes the bill at second reading, there could be a sizeable rebellion from those former Remainers representing Leave areas - safe in the knowledge that they wouldn't exactly be upsetting some powerful forces in the party. And the MPs who support what's called Common Market 2.0 could be crucial to the outcome. These are, broadly speaking, Labour MPs who are neither Corbynistas nor in favour of another referendum - such as Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock - and they are very keen to avoid no deal. However, if the Labour whip is to oppose, expect it to be rigorously enforced irrespective of the views of the party leader's office. So Mrs May's immediate fate may still be in the hands of opposition MPs The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Set against all this, there is plenty of analysis in the public domain which will tell you how impossible it is for a deal to go through. But right now, No 10 might well see ""highly improbable"" as grounds for optimism. Hope dies last, does it not?

Liverpool and Spurs fans in sponsor plea Champions League: Two weddings and a football final Mr Lundgren said 42 million people had flown with the airline over the winter season, with 65% of them paying Â£50 or less. ""The whole pricing picture is very dynamic,"" he said, adding that at peak booking times, EasyJet could fill a plane in six seconds. ""That's how quickly this goes and this is how the system reacts."" Mr Lundgren added: ""I can understand if people think that the prices are high on this occasion, because it is higher than the average. ""But there's no doubt that this was an occasion where the prices went very high because the demand was enormous."" He maintained that in comparison with other airlines, EasyJet was still offering lower prices, despite the huge increase. If you want to fly from Liverpool to Madrid on 31 May, it will cost you Â£750 one-way. There are no flights available on the day of the match itself, while return flights on 2 and 3 June are sold out. For Spurs fans, EasyJet flights from London Gatwick to Madrid are sold out on 1 June, but seats are still available the day before, at prices ranging from Â£350 to Â£750. All return flights are sold out on 2 June, but evening flights are still available on 3 June, with prices starting at Â£510. Seats on early morning flights from London Luton to Madrid on 1 June are selling at Â£750. Returns on 2 June are sold out, but you could come back on 3 June for Â£550. Other airlines are, of course, available. A typical London-to-Madrid economy fare on British Airways on the morning of 1 June will set you back Â£709, but that price drops to just Â£46 for an evening flight - which would get you in too late to see the match. Peter, Liverpool fan I live in Hong Kong, but I'm going to be in the UK on business. I bought my airline ticket on BA from London Heathrow to Madrid immediately after Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final. The tickets had already gone up six-fold within a couple of hours, from about Â£100 to Â£600 return. I'm going the day before and I'm coming back the day after, very early in the morning. It was even difficult to get the hotel. It's just an average hotel by the airport, ordinarily â¬120 a night, and that was â¬600-plus a night. We live in a world of shameless greed, but who, if they could, wouldn't take this opportunity to make money? It's solely about supply and demand. I'm lucky in the fact I can even afford this, but I do not envy the Chelsea and Arsenal fans who will travel to Baku for the Europa League final. Mr Lundgren's comments came after EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss in the same period a year earlier. The airline said cost per seat had gone up 3.9% due to fuel price increases and the impact of currency movements, while revenue per seat had fallen by 6.3% to Â£50.71. Easyjet also said had it suffered from ""the impact of drones at Gatwick in December"", which it said had cost it Â£10m. In April, EasyJet had warned about ""weak"" summer sales amid Brexit uncertainty. In its latest results, the carrier said revenue per seat in the second half of the year would be slightly lower. ""This is not helped by the ongoing negative impact of Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider macroeconomic slowdown in Europe,"" it said.

"The pound has sunk to a four-month low against the dollar after cross-party Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour collapsed. On Friday evening, the pound was0.52% lower against the dollarat $1.273, having had its worst week in a year. The pound was 2% lower this week, its steepest decline since February last year when it fell by more than 2%. Its fall reflects investors pricing a higher chance of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, analysts said. ""While talks with Labour were ongoing, the market was slightly more reassured that an EU customs union or something similar to the status quo would be the outcome,"" said Eimear Daly, a foreign exchange strategist at Macquarie Bank. ""Now the focus turns to the Prime Minister's ability to retain leadership of the Conservatives, or perhaps a more eurosceptic Tory Party leader,"" she said. Against the euro, the pound fell 0.46% to â¬1.140. Mrs Mayhas promised to set a timetable for the election of her successorafter the next Brexit vote in the first week of June. RBC Capital Markets chief currency strategist Adam Coles said there was growing uncertainty over whether the Brexit bill would pass, as well as doubts over who will replace Theresa May as Prime Minister. ""It looks increasingly likely she will be replaced by a pro-Brexit PM with no election, and that automatically increases the chances of a no-deal Brexit,"" said Mr Coles. Since the UK's departure from the EU was delayed in March, the pound has broadly traded above $1.29 against the dollar. Mrs May will try once again to win the support of MPs for her Brexit deal in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March - but after MPs voted down on three occasions the deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc, the EU gave the UK an extension until 31 October.

The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims Analysis by Reality Check The number of people being taken to court for possessing a weapon has been rising. There's a bit of a time lag when it comes to getting figures from the criminal justice system, so the latest ones we have, published on Thursday, only take us up to the end of last year. In 2018, the Ministry of Justice recorded 21,587 cases of people in England Wales being prosecuted for possessing a weapon, of which 13,350 cases led to a conviction - compared with 17,669 cases in 2013 - with 10,026 leading to a conviction. This was mostly driven by a rise in the offence of ""having possession of a bladed article in a public place"". For adults, the maximum sentence for possessing a knife is four years. Knife possession is now making up a bigger share of all weapons offences - two-thirds compared with half 10 years ago. And a bigger proportion of knife and weapons possession offences now result in jail time - 36% compared with 20% in 2008. These figures cover both adults and children aged 10-17. For adults only, 42% of weapons offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence last year. While knife possession offences have been rising since 2013, they are still lower than a decade ago. About these figures Information supplied by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Figures are correct at time of publication but may change as investigations progress and charges are brought or dropped. Â© 2025 BBC.

"EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, has defended his airline's high ticket prices to fly to Madrid for the Champions League final between Tottenham and Liverpool on 1 June. Football fans complained to BBC Radio 5 Live that flights around that date cost Â£1,000 instead of Â£250 normally. But Mr Lundgren said the price was higher than average because there had been an ""enormous"" surge in demand. ""That is actually how the system works,"" he said. Liverpool and Spurs fans in sponsor plea Champions League: Two weddings and a football final Mr Lundgren said 42 million people had flown with the airline over the winter season, with 65% of them paying Â£50 or less. ""The whole pricing picture is very dynamic,"" he said, adding that at peak booking times, EasyJet could fill a plane in six seconds. ""That's how quickly this goes and this is how the system reacts."" Mr Lundgren added: ""I can understand if people think that the prices are high on this occasion, because it is higher than the average. ""But there's no doubt that this was an occasion where the prices went very high because the demand was enormous."" He maintained that in comparison with other airlines, EasyJet was still offering lower prices, despite the huge increase. If you want to fly from Liverpool to Madrid on 31 May, it will cost you Â£750 one-way. There are no flights available on the day of the match itself, while return flights on 2 and 3 June are sold out. For Spurs fans, EasyJet flights from London Gatwick to Madrid are sold out on 1 June, but seats are still available the day before, at prices ranging from Â£350 to Â£750. All return flights are sold out on 2 June, but evening flights are still available on 3 June, with prices starting at Â£510. Seats on early morning flights from London Luton to Madrid on 1 June are selling at Â£750. Returns on 2 June are sold out, but you could come back on 3 June for Â£550. Other airlines are, of course, available. A typical London-to-Madrid economy fare on British Airways on the morning of 1 June will set you back Â£709, but that price drops to just Â£46 for an evening flight - which would get you in too late to see the match. Peter, Liverpool fan I live in Hong Kong, but I'm going to be in the UK on business. I bought my airline ticket on BA from London Heathrow to Madrid immediately after Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final. The tickets had already gone up six-fold within a couple of hours, from about Â£100 to Â£600 return. I'm going the day before and I'm coming back the day after, very early in the morning. It was even difficult to get the hotel. It's just an average hotel by the airport, ordinarily â¬120 a night, and that was â¬600-plus a night. We live in a world of shameless greed, but who, if they could, wouldn't take this opportunity to make money? It's solely about supply and demand. I'm lucky in the fact I can even afford this, but I do not envy the Chelsea and Arsenal fans who will travel to Baku for the Europa League final. Mr Lundgren's comments came after EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss in the same period a year earlier. The airline said cost per seat had gone up 3.9% due to fuel price increases and the impact of currency movements, while revenue per seat had fallen by 6.3% to Â£50.71. Easyjet also said had it suffered from ""the impact of drones at Gatwick in December"", which it said had cost it Â£10m. In April, EasyJet had warned about ""weak"" summer sales amid Brexit uncertainty. In its latest results, the carrier said revenue per seat in the second half of the year would be slightly lower. ""This is not helped by the ongoing negative impact of Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider macroeconomic slowdown in Europe,"" it said.

" By Theo Leggett There was little more the pilots could have done.As alarms sounded in their cockpit, the captain and first officer struggled to regain control of their stricken aircraft.They were far too close to the ground, and needed to gain altitude. Yet when Capt Yared Getachew tried to guide the nose of the Boeing 737 upwards, an electronic system forced it down again.Simply pulling back on his control column wasn’t enough. So he used a thumb switch as well, to adjust the aerodynamic balance of the plane, and encourage it to climb. But a few seconds later, those adjustments were automatically reversed.The column was shaking in his hands, a mechanical warning that the aircraft was in danger of stalling and falling out of the sky. A harsh robotic voice called out “don’t sink” three times, indicating that the plane was losing height.Together, he and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed Omar worked quickly to find a solution. They flicked switches on the centre console to disable part of the electronics, and began using manual controls instead, in an attempt to make the plane fly normally. Capt Yared Getachew (right) Capt Yared Getachew (right) Regaining control was difficult. By now the aircraft was gathering speed, and aerodynamic forces were building rapidly; it’s likely they had simply become too great for the pilots to fight against using manual controls.Whatever the reason, they turned the electronics back on and Capt Getachew tried once more to raise the nose of the aircraft, using the thumb switch on his controls. With power assistance restored, the aircraft responded. Briefly it began to climb.But then, inexorably, the process was reversed as the computers intervened yet again. Another alarm was now chirping urgently, warning that the speed of the plane had become dangerously high, as it began to dive towards the ground.In desperation, Capt Getachew called on his co-pilot for help. Together, they hauled back on their control columns, using their combined strength, in a last-ditch effort to overcome the forces arrayed against them with sheer muscle power.The dive became steeper and steeper, and the aircraft fell faster and faster, until it slammed into the ground at more than 500mph, just six minutes after taking off.  One hundred and fifty seven people from 35 different countries died.They included 49-year-old Anthony Ngare, deputy director of communications for the UN's cultural agency, Unesco; Ethiopian flight attendant Sara Gebre Michael, a mother of three children; and retired Nigerian diplomat Abiodun Bashua. Kosha Vaidya and her husband Prerit Dixit were travelling with their daughters, Ashka and Anushka Kosha Vaidya and her husband Prerit Dixit were travelling with their daughters, Ashka and Anushka From Canada, there were three generations of one family.Kosha Vaidya and her husband Prerit Dixit were travelling with their two teenage daughters, Ashka and Anushka, as well as Kosha’s parents, Pannagesh and Hansini.All had boarded the plane for an early morning flight from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to Nairobi, in Kenya.The weather was good, and the visibility was clear. The aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 8, was new. Just five months beforehand, a near identical Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by Indonesian carrier Lion Air, had set out on another routine journey from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.The flight to the western city of Pangkal Pinang was meant to last little more than an hour. But moments after taking off, the pilots found themselves in serious trouble.They were fighting for control, mystified as the aircraft seemed to take on a mind of its own, trying to descend when it was supposed to be climbing.They had no idea what was going on. Each time they tried to bring the nose up, their actions would be reversed a few seconds later as automatic systems forced it down again.This happened more than 20 times, with the aircraft bucking erratically through the sky. Air traffic controllers became worried when they noticed on their radar screens that it was descending. On the radio, one of the pilots told them he had a “flight control problem”.As the crew tried to work out what had gone wrong, they became even more confused, because their instruments were indicating different altitudes. They didn’t know how high the plane was, or how fast it was going.Eventually, they lost control altogether. The aeroplane went into a steep dive that couldn’t be recovered, and crashed at high speed into the Java Sea.One hundred and eighty nine people lost their lives. Flight path of Lion air Flight 610 Flight path of Lion air Flight 610 Two remarkably similar accidents, just five months apart, involving the same brand new aircraft design. Within days of the second crash, investigators had noted “clear similarities” between them. So was there a common cause? Vertical speed readings show rate of climb/descent, based on available data from Flight Radar 24 Vertical speed readings show rate of climb/descent, based on available data from Flight Radar 24 When an aircraft crashes, an investigation has to start quickly. Relatives want answers. Airlines and manufacturers need to know if the same thing could happen again. What investigators really want to find is the flight data recorder. In the case of the Lion Air jet, this was recovered from the sea floor within days. It provided a wealth of detail about the doomed flight. Official shows the flight data recorder of Lion Air flight 610 Official shows the flight data recorder of Lion Air flight 610 Suspicion quickly focused on a piece of flight control software designed to operate in the background, without the pilot even being aware of it. It was meant to make the plane easier and more familiar to fly for pilots who were already used to the previous generation of Boeing 737. It was designed to curb a tendency for the 737 Max’s nose to rise too much, when it was already pitched up at a steep angle. But it appeared to have been activated at the wrong time and to have forced the nose of the aircraft down when it was supposed to be climbing. The stabilisers - small wings on either side of the tail - were being moved into the wrong position by the flight computer. When the crew tried to correct them, they simply moved back. Boeing insisted its aircraft was safe, but issued a bulletin to airlines explaining what could happen, and what to do. In their everyday work, pilots rely heavily on printed checklists, which set out step by step precisely how different operations should be carried out. When something goes wrong in the air, there are further checklists they can draw on, to help them diagnose and solve a range of different problems. In this case, pilots were told to follow steps set out in an existing checklist which they are required to memorise, designed to help them deal with an abnormal situation affecting the stabilisers. It told them to turn off power to the automatic control system, by flipping two cut-off switches. They could then operate the stabilisers manually, using a crank handle in the cockpit. Boeing was confident that if pilots followed these instructions the plane could be flown safely. Nevertheless, it began developing new software to eradicate the problem. This was still being worked on when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 set out on its final journey.The cause of the two accidents, we now know, was very probably the same.And according to an interim report, the Ethiopian Airlines pilots reacted to the emergency as the manufacturer had told them to. But it didn’t save their lives, or those of their passengers.Now, Boeing is facing serious questions - about whether it was right to assume the aircraft was safe, or whether it should have taken more radical steps after the Lion Air crash.The 737 Max has been grounded.The way in which pilots around the world are trained to deal with the increasingly high-tech systems aboard modern airliners is also being thrown into sharp relief.And the close relationship between the aerospace giant and the US body that is meant to regulate the industry, the Federal Aviation Administration, has come under scrutiny as never before. Families of the victims of Lion Air flight 610, visit an operations centre to look for personal items of their relatives. Jakarta, Indonesia Families of the victims of Lion Air flight 610, visit an operations centre to look for personal items of their relatives. Jakarta, Indonesia It was a proud moment, and the culmination of four years of hard work. On 8 December 2015, in front of thousands of employees at its factory in Renton, Washington State, Boeing unveiled its latest aircraft. There was intense anticipation as music boomed out, lights flashed, and the vast hangar doors slowly opened. Standing there, resplendent in Boeing’s dark blue and white corporate livery, and emblazoned with the tailfin logos of some 60 airlines, was the Spirit of Renton, the first ever 737 Max. Boeing’s workers thronged around their creation, wearing their blue 737 Max baseball caps, taking selfies with the plane. The new model would go on to become the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing’s history. But the Max wasn’t entirely new. It was the latest version of Boeing’s 737, a model which first flew in 1967. Since then, the 737 had been periodically reinvented and re-engineered to keep it flying into the 21st Century. The Max was to be the fourth generation of the 737 family - cleaner, quieter and much more efficient than its predecessors. Boeing really needed it to succeed. Four years before the launch, the company had had a serious problem. Its great European rival Airbus was already developing a new version of its A320 - a direct competitor to the 737. Rivalry between Boeing and Airbus has always been intense. The 737 and A320 are the workhorses of the aviation world, with thousands of them plying their trade on short and medium-haul routes around the globe every day.  They have provided a steady and reliable source of profit for both companies, with the market split relatively evenly between them. But the new A320 threatened to give Airbus a big advantage. The modified aircraft would have revised aerodynamics, and would be fitted with a choice of new engines. This would enable it to become quieter and to produce fewer emissions, as well as giving it the choice of a longer range or a higher payload. But more importantly it would be much cheaper to operate. In recent years, fuel has typically accounted for 20% to 25% of carriers’ operating expenses. According to Airbus, the new engine would be up to 15% more fuel efficient. Airbus began racking up orders for the overhauled plane, christened the A320neo (for new engine option), while demand for the 737 flagged. Boeing simply had to respond.  “The longer Boeing left it, the further it would fall behind,” explains pilot and 737 expert Chris Brady.Boeing had been studying options for a possible 737 replacement for several years.But at the time, its 787 Dreamliner - billed as a groundbreaking and super-efficient design - was years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.The company’s board appeared reluctant to give the go-ahead for another plane to be designed from scratch. The only other option was to re-engineer its existing aircraft and fit new, more efficient engines.As commercial pressures mounted, and amid signs one of its main customers, American Airlines, was about to place a major order with Airbus, Boeing gave the 737 Max programme the green light.Although the A320 and the 737 look very similar, the engineering challenges faced by the two manufacturers were very different.The A320 is fundamentally a much more modern aircraft, one which began flying in the late 1980s. It is taller than the 737, which is still based on its 1960s airframe.For Boeing, this meant installing the new engines was far from easy.A solution had to be found. But that solution had unintended consequences. When it was introduced in the 1960s, the 737 was built to be low to the ground. This made it easier to load baggage and get passengers aboard using stairs - a particular advantage at the small, regional airports it was designed to serve. Look at a photo of one of the early 737s, and you’ll see that the engine is a slim, cigar shape mounted directly beneath the wing. But as engine technology developed, and the aircraft was updated, the low ground clearance caused problems. In recent years, quieter and more efficient engines have been developed, but for technical reasons, they are much fatter than their predecessors. With the 737 Max, Boeing wanted to use the most efficient engine available: the CFM International LEAP. A variant had already been chosen by Airbus for the updated version of its A320. “Once Airbus said they’d use it and the A320 was going to become much more fuel efficient, Boeing had to do the same,” says Brady. “It would have been commercial suicide otherwise.” But the LEAP was too big to sit comfortably beneath the wing of Boeing’s low-slung aircraft. So the engine was moved higher up and further forward on the wing. This solved one problem, but created another. Boeing 737 MAX's LEAP engine Boeing 737 MAX's LEAP engine The modifications created unusual handling characteristics. In essence, it was found that the aircraft had a tendency to lift its nose upwards, particularly when it was already pitched at a steep angle. This was unhelpful, because an excessively high “angle of attack,” as it is known, can cause an aerodynamic stall - suddenly robbing the wings of lift and causing the plane to lose altitude. It’s a situation flight crews would be careful to avoid. Yet under these circumstances experienced pilots found the controls of the aircraft felt unfamiliar: unusually light, and rather different to what they had experienced with the previous generation of 737. Boeing’s engineers developed a control system called MCAS - Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - to ensure that the way the 737 Max behaved in the air remained consistent and matched that of previous generations of the plane. This piece of software brings the nose of the aircraft down automatically, under very specific circumstances, without the intervention of the pilot. Investigations into both 737 Max crashes are still under way, but the finger of suspicion has already been pointed firmly at MCAS.  What it does is relatively simple. It moves the horizontal stabilisers - the tail wings of the aircraft, which are normally used to help the aircraft maintain level flight - to bring the nose downward. This has two effects: it increases pressure on the pilot’s control column, making the handling feel more familiar to experienced 737 pilots; and it reduces the risk of the nose rising too far and triggering a stall - although Boeing insists it is not an anti-stall system, and is simply there “to enhance the pitch stability of the airplane - so that it feels and flies like other 737s”. What now seems apparent with the benefit of hindsight is that MCAS had design flaws. First, it relied on data from a single angle of attack sensor, even though the aircraft had two of them. This type of sensor, in the nose of an aircraft, measures the angle at which it is encountering the airstream. But relying on only one of them meant that if it failed, the system could deploy at the wrong time, and push the nose of the aircraft down when it was supposed to be climbing, for example. Second, although the pilot could use a thumb control to correct the pitch of the aircraft, MCAS would deploy repeatedly in cycles, forcing the nose down again and again. MCAS worked in the background, and it wasn’t until after the Lion Air crash that Boeing explained what it was and how it could be deactivated. It was not specifically mentioned in the flight manual - which is meant to give pilots the information they need to fly the aircraft safely. Recent reports in the US media suggest that flight crews themselves were deeply unhappy they had not been kept informed. An audio recording obtained by CBS News purportedly contains an exchange between members of American Airlines’ pilots union and a company official, which took place a month after the first crash. In it, one pilot angrily informs the official that “we flat out deserve to know what is on our airplanes”. Boeing emphasises that there are set procedures for pilots to follow, which are meant to help them deal with uncontrolled stabiliser movements, whatever their cause. These were contained in the manual, and should have been memorised by the pilots as well. It says the manual did tell crews to expect automatic stabiliser movements as the plane approached stalling speed, the “same type of aircraft behaviour” caused by MCAS. It has also pointed out that the day before the Lion Air crash, the same aircraft experienced similar problems, but was able to continue safely to its destination. On that flight, within seconds of take-off, the airspeed and altitude indicators gave sharply different readings. Then the nose of the aircraft began moving down of its own accord. But this time, the pilots worked out what to do about it. They cut off power to the electronics operating the stabilisers and began controlling them manually. They may have been lucky, though. According tomedia reports, they were told what to do by a third pilot who happened to be in the cockpit, having hitched a ride aboard the plane. Since these incidents, serious questions have been raised about the design of the MCAS software and whether the 737 Max was allowed into service despite a potential catastrophic flaw. So what were the circumstances in which it was certified as safe to fly in the first place - and why was it not grounded when that flaw first came to light? Many analysts are now pointing the finger at the close, even symbiotic, relationship between the company and the regulator responsible for aviation safety in the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  Grounded Boeing 737 MAX planes at Southern California logistics airport Grounded Boeing 737 MAX planes at Southern California logistics airport The charge being levelled against the FAA is that it was a victim of so-called “regulatory capture”.This is what happens when a government agency’s relationship with the industry it oversees becomes too close for comfort; instead of acting primarily in the interests of the public, it puts the needs of businesses first.The FAA was responsible for certifying the 737 Max and giving it permission to fly.Critics have suggested both that the agency was too slow to ground the plane and that the original certification process itself was flawed.Among them is US senator Richard Blumenthal. In a tense hearing organised by a Senate committee after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, he was scathing about the FAA’s alleged failings. Richard Blumenthal Richard Blumenthal It had, he said, lagged behind other aviation authorities in preventing the 737 Max from flying. But more seriously, he said, it had “decided to do safety on the cheap… and put the fox in charge of the henhouse”. In other words, too much of the safety work on the plane had been outsourced to Boeing itself.In the rush to produce the new aircraft, he argued, critical safety features had been disregarded.Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General at the US Department of Transportation who has been a thorn in the side of the FAA for many years, takes a similar view. Mary Schiavo Mary Schiavo During her tenure at the DoT in the mid-1990s, she oversaw an audit of the FAA’s work relating to the Boeing 777, and concluded that the bulk of the work was done by Boeing itself, with little real oversight.“At the FAA, they know they’re outgunned by Boeing,” she says. “They know they don’t have the kind of resources they need to do the job they’re tasked with doing.“They pretend to inspect, and Boeing pretends to be inspected, when in fact Boeing is doing it all almost entirely by itself.”There’s no question Boeing does have tremendous economic clout.In the US alone, it employs more than 135,000 people, and claims to support more than a million more jobs across thousands of American suppliers. It is the world’s biggest aerospace company, with annual revenues of more than $100bn, and profits of more than $10bn.Barbara Lichman, an aviation lawyer and former Washington lobbyist, says it also has plenty of political power.“Companies of that size have very proficient lobbyists,” she says. “They hit Congress very, very hard, and put pressure on them to relieve pressure on the company.”Whether or not politics were involved, the FAA certainly appeared reluctant at first to ground the 737 Max, far more so than other civil aviation authorities.On 11 March, the day after the Ethiopian Airlines flight 310 crashed, the FAA published a “continued airworthiness notification”, which in effect gave the aircraft the green light to continue flying.Although it acknowledged that external reports were “drawing similarities” between the latest accident and the Lion Air disaster in October 2018, the agency insisted that as the investigation into the Ethiopian crash had just begun, it did not have sufficient data “to draw any conclusions or take any actions”.Yet others were more cautious. China’s civil aviation authority was one of the first to order the grounding of the plane, along with Ethiopia, just a day after the accident. Many others followed suit.But it was not until 13 March that the FAA itself banned the plane from flying. The FAA insisted that by this point further information had come to light which justified its actions. The acting head of the agency, Daniel K Elwell later told American lawmakers that while the US had indeed been one of the last countries to ground the 737 Max, it was the first to do so “with data”.The more worrying accusation against the FAA, however, is that the entire process of certifying the aircraft as safe to fly was flawed - because most of the work was carried out by Boeing itself, and the agency failed to provide sufficient oversight.The FAA operates a system - known as the Organisation Designation Authorisation programme - which allows designated companies and individuals to carry out certification work on aircraft.The 79 current ODA holders are, in effect, allowed to act as representatives of the FAA, and are permitted to conduct inspections, carry out tests and issue certificates on its behalf.There is a good reason for this. Modern airliners are complex beasts, combining cutting-edge engineering with powerful computers that run software requiring millions of lines of code. The FAA, meanwhile, is a government institution with limited resources.By delegating some 90% of its certification work, in theory the agency is able to focus on oversight, ensuring that tasks are carried out properly, according to its own rules and procedures.According to Elwell, this is not just desirable, but essential. He told senators that without the ODA programme, the FAA would need an extra 10,000 employees to do the same work, and it would cost US taxpayers around $1.8bn per year.Meanwhile, former Boeing safety engineer Dr Todd Curtis, who now runs the website Airsafety.com, says the system does create a potential conflict of interest because work on behalf of the FAA is carried out by people who receive their pay cheques from the aerospace giant. But he insists he personally never saw any behaviour that gave cause for concern.In the case of the 737 Max, critics believe that in its desperation to get the aircraft on to the market, the potential dangers of the MCAS system were not explored thoroughly enough - and the FAA failed to step in.“Because Boeing knew whatever they did, and whatever they submitted [to the FAA], it was going to be certified. So, they got sloppy. Or sloppier,” says Mary Schiavo.Both Boeing and the FAA entirely reject this.In a statement the FAA told the BBC: “The FAA’s aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs. The 737 Max programme took five years and involved 110,000 hours of work on the part of FAA personnel, following the FAA’s standard certification process.”It added: “The use of delegation has been a vital part of our safety system since the 1920s and without it the success of our country’s aviation system likely would have been stifled.” Test pilots emerge from from a Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliner at Boeing Field after completing the plane's first flight on 29 January, 2016 in Seattle, Washington Test pilots emerge from from a Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliner at Boeing Field after completing the plane's first flight on 29 January, 2016 in Seattle, Washington Boeing, meanwhile, says it “operates in full accordance with all Federal Aviation Administration oversight requirements and processes”. It insists that “the long-standing collaborative engagement between the FAA, Boeing, its customers and industry partners has created the safest transportation system in the world”.Nevertheless, since the Ethiopian Airlines accident, the Department of Transportation has set up an expert committee to review the FAA’s certification processes.Meanwhile pressure on Boeing itself is mounting.It is already facing a number of lawsuits from relatives of the victims of both crashes. Outside the company’s annual general meeting in late April, protesters called for chief executive Dennis Muilenburg to face prosecution. Dennis Muilenburg Dennis Muilenburg It is also being sued by some investors who claim the company concealed problems with the 737 Max and “effectively put profitability and growth ahead of airplane safety and honesty”.Damaging information continues to emerge. In early May, Boeing admitted that a warning mechanism which should have been fitted as standard to the 737 Max would not work unless customers had also fitted a separate, paid-for cockpit display. Tarek Milleron holds photographs of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plane crash while protesting outside Boeing's annual shareholders meeting. Chicago, Illinois Tarek Milleron holds photographs of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plane crash while protesting outside Boeing's annual shareholders meeting. Chicago, Illinois The warning system, known as an AoA Disagree alert, was meant to tell pilots when the two angle of attack sensors on the aircraft were giving conflicting readings, in case one of them failed.Engineers first became aware of the problem months before the Lion Air crash, but airlines were not informed until afterwards, and nor was the FAA - because Boeing staff believed it did not compromise safety.A further evaluation was carried out after the accident - and this time Boeing says the FAA and airlines were informed.Boeing continues to insist that the absence of the system was not safety-critical. It says:“On every airplane delivered to our customers, including the MAX, all flight data and information needed to safely operate the aircraft is provided in the flight deck on the primary flight deck displays... Neither the angle of attack indicator nor the AOA Disagree alert are necessary for the safe operation of the airplane.”But 737 expert Brady thinks the information it provided would still have been useful to the pilots in both stricken aircraft.“I firmly believe that… any information or clue that helps you troubleshoot a problem and piece together what is happening has to be of value,” he says.Meanwhile, the revelation has raised further questions about transparency at the aerospace giant - and whether or not it has failed to report any other potential safety concerns. Boeing 737 flight simulator (not the MAX 8) Boeing 737 flight simulator (not the MAX 8) As you line up at the departure gate before a flight, unless you’re a particularly nervous traveller, the chances are you don’t give too much thought to safety. Reports of air crashes are invariably harrowing - but they are also extremely rare. Last year, there was one fatal accident for every 2,520,000 flights, according to the Aviation Safety Network.One reason why safety standards have traditionally been so high is because pilots have to be highly qualified.As a general rule, pilot training is lengthy, disciplined and rigorous. For example, in the UK, the cost of obtaining a commercial licence to fly large aircraft can easily exceed £100,000. It involves hundreds of hours of teaching.First you need to gain a private pilot’s licence. Then you need further training in order to build up flying hours and learn how to fly using instruments in poor visibility, not to mention passing theory exams, before being awarded a commercial licence.That can then be followed by yet more training to learn how to fly a specific aircraft, and get the necessary certificate, or “type rating”.Yet some experts are concerned that these high standards are starting to slip, as airlines and manufacturers try to reduce the amount of time and money that needs to be spent on training.Some see what happened with the 737 Max as symptomatic of this trend.Although there were significant physical differences between the previous 737 and the Max, pilots who had flown the older version were only required to complete a short online tutorial before carrying passengers aboard the Max.By making the plane handle like the previous generation of 737, Boeing also ensured that pilots would not need extensive extra training to fly it.Dai Whittingham is the chief executive of UK Flight Safety Committee, an independent trade organisation with major UK airlines, airports, academics and manufacturers among its members. He thinks there is a definite downward trend.“Standards of UK training and safety are excellent,” he says. “But as an industry we’ve had a bit of a race to the bottom on the costs associated with training.“Airlines don’t want to spend money on training if they don’t have to. We’ve seen this with the Boeing 737 Max. It is a different body and aircraft but certifiers gave it the same type rating.”This is a crucial point. If a new aircraft is awarded the same type rating as previous models in a series, less training is needed. That reduces costs, particularly if the job can be done through a fairly simple online tutorial, rather than, for example, time spent in a full-scale simulator, which can be expensive. Whittingham insists that ""shareholders are squeezing airlines hard on costs”.“Training requirements are being set to the absolute minimum. If airlines want to do more training then they have to argue with their financial teams to get it signed off.”Getting pilots to talk about this is difficult. Nevertheless, a few have chosen to do so. Among them is Dr Karlene Petitt, an experienced pilot based in the US. She has become a vocal critic of airline safety culture, drawing on research carried out for her doctoral thesis. Dr Karlene Petitt Dr Karlene Petitt  “I believe we have a problem with pilot training worldwide, and the data supports this analysis,” she says. “Safety and training are going in the wrong direction. It is something that the Federal Aviation Administration has known for years. “Is learning from a flash drive the same as structured classroom learning with an instructor? More so, is an electronic exam an accurate assessment of knowledge?"" As part of her two-year research programme, Dr Petitt distributed a survey among pilot groups expecting a few hundred responses. She says she received more than 7,500. “The significance of this number identifies that pilots worldwide care about the safety of the industry,” she says. “Comments received from these pilots have further identified concern with the trajectory… of where this industry is going.” Another area which worries her is the increased automation of flying. She fears that as pilots become more reliant on computerised systems, they are losing the skills to fly the planes themselves - and respond when things go wrong. Dai Whittingham takes a similar view. “Physical, hands-on flying - pilots do less of it now, because the computer is more efficient for fuel. Pilots make mistakes and that costs money,” he says. This isn’t a new theory. Back in 1997, in a famous lecture at American Airlines’ Flight Academy, Captain Warren Vandeburgh warned that pilots were becoming “Children of the magenta”, over-reliant on the magenta lines on their cockpit displays. He identified a culture among pilots of becoming too dependent on automated systems, undermining their ability to react to fast-moving situations. Boeing now says all pilots who intend to fly the Max when it has been recertified as safe to fly will have to undertake a new training programme. Meanwhile investigators will continue to look closely at how well the pilots involved in the two crashes understood the systems they were using.  Boeing has developed a software update to change the way MCAS works.In future, the system will rely on information from two angle-of-attack sensors, rather than just one. If the two sensors give different readings, the pilots will be alerted to the fact and if they vary too much MCAS will simply be switched off.There will be other safeguards, too - ensuring that the system can always be counteracted by the flight crew, and preventing it from deploying multiple times “in non-normal conditions”.At a congressional hearing on 15 May, the FAA’s acting administrator Daniel Elwell said he expected to receive details of the update from Boeing “in the next week or so”.It would, he said, be subject to a “thorough and rigorous safety analysis”. The aircraft would not be allowed to fly in the US until it was “absolutely safe to do so”.It is still far from clear when this will happen. Safety agencies from around the world are due to meet in Washington on 22 May to discuss the FAA’s latest safety analysis.Meanwhile, winning back the confidence of passengers may not be easy, but aviation historian Shea Oakley believes the aircraft can still be a success, once it has been allowed back in the sky.“There have been a number of commercial airliners that suffered fatal crashes early on, that were linked to either design or pilot training issues,” he says.He points out that aircraft such as the Boeing 727, the BAC 1-11 and McDonnell Douglas DC10 were involved in major accidents soon after being launched, remained on sale for decades afterwards.Boeing’s chief executive Muilenburg has pledged that once MCAS has been modified, the 737 Max will be one of the safest aircraft ever built.Boeing still has more than 4,500 orders for the Max, and airlines want their new planes. Those efficiency improvements are still badly needed, and Airbus alone cannot hope to meet demand.Production continues and the chances are most of those outstanding orders will be fulfilled.But that doesn’t mean Boeing can simply get the aircraft flying and act as though nothing has happened.The two accidents claimed the lives of 346 people. Formal investigations are ongoing, and more information may yet emerge. Relatives of the victims are demanding answers. There is a great deal of anger - and lawsuits are mounting up.The US Department of Transportation is looking into the certification process for the 737 Max, and the Department of Justice is also taking an interest. It’s far from clear where these inquiries will lead, and what the outcome could mean for the company or its senior executives.Nor should we forget the impact these accidents will have had on Boeing’s own employees. They were clearly proud of their new creation. They certainly did not intend to make a product that was in any way unsafe. Now, people within the aerospace giant say they feel “shattered” by what has happened.Nevertheless, Boeing will almost certainly recover in the end. And despite the two tragedies, it is highly likely the 737 Max itself will be flying for years or even decades to come.

"India's election is nearly over: voting began on 11 April, and the final ballot was cast on 19 May with results out on 23 May. Every day, the BBC will be bringing you all the latest updates on the twists and turns of the world's largest democracy. What happened? The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has told opposition parties to accept ""defeat with grace"" after a slew of exit polls suggested that the ruling party would get a comfortable majority and form the next government. Opposition parties have not only rejected the the exit polls but have also raised concerns of vote fraud. A number of videos, allegedly showing Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being tampered with, went viral on social media on Tuesday. These prompted several leaders from opposition parties to meet election officials to raise their concerns. They have demanded more transparency in the counting process. But the BJP has rejected their concerns. ""EVM is good when Mamata Banerjee became West Bengal chief minister twice and Amarinder Singh became Punjab chief minister. If they win, EVM is good. But when there is expectation that we will win because people of this country want Narendra Modi to be prime minister again, then EVM is unreliable. The BJP condemns their (opposition) conduct and will tell humbly to accept their defeat with grace,"" Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Why does this matter? These allegations have left a bitter taste in the aftermath of the mammoth election in the world's largest democracy, souring what should have been a triumphant achievement for the  Election Commission (EC). The bitter war of words between the ruling and opposition parties ahead of counting day on Thursday forced the EC to issue a series of ""confidence-building"" statements. Opposition parties said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should be done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. On Tuesday: India poll officials deny 'vote fraud' More than 1.5 million e-voting machines will be used in the summer elections What happened? India's Election Commission has denied allegations that voting machines had been tampered with in parts of India. India's opposition parties are meeting the election watchdog on Tuesday to demand more transparency in counting of votes on 23 May (Thursday). Opposition leaders said the EC had to ensure that there was no possibility of anybody manipulating the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) which were used to record votes in the general election that concluded on Sunday. In Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur constituency, a candidate belonging to the opposition Bahujan Samaj Party held a protest outside a room where the machines have been stored ahead of the counting. The candidate alleged that attempts were being made to take out the machines from the storage room. Local officials have said the allegations are baseless. Allow Twitter content?

In Chandauli constituency, supporters of Samajwadi Party have circulated a mobile phone clip, alleging that some machines were being brought to the counting station on Monday, a day after the election. Local officials have said the machines shown in the video are reserve machines which had been brought from another part of the constituency because of logistical reasons. The Election Commission has insisted that ""proper security and protocol"" was maintained in storing the electronic voting machines. Why does this matter? The move comes after a slew of exit polls predicted that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would get a comfortable majority in parliament to form a government. Sitaram Yechury from the Left Front said the EC was ""yet to come out with a mechanism"" to deal with a mismatch between an EVM result and the corresponding paper trail. During voting, EVMs are connected to a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to tally the results from five EVMs with VVPAT receipts in at least five polling stations in every assembly seat. A parliamentary constituency comprises several assembly seats. But opposition parties say that the tally should done for the entire constituency in case of a mismatch. ""On VVPATs and the EVM tally, the EC is yet to come out with a procedure in case there is a mismatch. Even if there is one mismatch in the EVMs or VVPAT samples picked for counting, to maintain the integrity of the electoral process, all VVPATs in that Assembly segment must be counted. This is important to maintain integrity of the electoral process,"" Mr Yechury said. If this were to happen however, it would considerably slow down the counting process and declaration of results. What happened? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted on the occasion of the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Modi has repeatedly attacked Mr Gandhi on the campaign trail and his slurs have prompted widespread criticism. He called Mr Gandhi the ""number one corrupt man in the country"" at a rally earlier this month in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. A few days later, he went after Mr Gandhi again - accusing him of using a naval aircraft carrier to take him and his family to an island for a ""family holiday"". Mr Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 1991 during a campaign rally. Why does this matter? Mr Modi's tweet marking Mr Gandhi's death anniversary is customary - but it has garnered attention because he attacked the former prime minister repeatedly while campaigning and didn't back down when challenged. Many were taken aback by Mr Modi's criticism of Mr Gandhi. It elicited condemnation not just from the main opposition Congress party, but other regional opposition leaders, political commentators and even former political opponents of Mr Gandhi. Analysts said the comments were a sign of ""desperation"" and showed that Mr Modi ""knew"" his party was not going to perform as well as expected in the election. Now that campaigning is over and the election is nearly at an end, Mr Modi seems to be abandoning acerbic rhetoric for something more conciliatory. What happened? Opposition leaders have dismissed the exit polls, which suggest that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election. Allow Twitter content?

A slew of exit polls released on Sunday predict big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).  The highest poll prediction for the NDA is 365 seats, and the lowest is 242. An average of all exit polls gives the NDA 295 seats. Any party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to secure a majority in parliament and form a government. The BJP welcomed the prediction and many of its leaders congratulated party workers' efforts on social media. Why does this matter? Exit polls have to be taken with caution because they have been wrong in the past - a fact that opposition leaders were quick to point out. Allow Twitter content?

The BJP is locked in a fierce electoral battle with the Congress and a clutch of regional parties in various states. But the trends suggest that the opposition's strategy may have failed. The most surprising prediction has come from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which sends 80 MPs to parliament - more than any other. So the state always holds the key to who forms the government - in 2014, the BJP won 71 seats. Analysts had predicted that powerful regional parties would comfortably defeat the BJP this time around. But most of the exit polls suggest the party will perform much better than expected in UP - winning anything between 38 to 68 seats. Only two polls - Nielsen-ABP and NewsX-Neta - have predicted that the BJP would lose at least 40 seats in UP to regional parties. Nielsen-ABP says the NDA will win 22 seats in the state, while NewsX-Neta gives the coalition only 33 seats. These are the the only two polls which predict that the BJP-led alliance could fall short of an outright majority. Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi?

"Shares in Thomas Cook have plunged 30% after analysts at a bank said the travel firm's shares were ""worthless"". Thomas Cook's tour operations and airline are worth Â£738m, but its debt is around the same ""and implies zero equity value"", according to Citigroup. Citigroup's damning conclusion comes a day afterThomas Cook issued its third profit warningin less than a year and reported a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Its outlook was ""significantly weaker than expected,"" Citigroup said. The analysts also pointed to a warning from auditor EY on Thomas' Cook's results which warned of ""material uncertainties"" over the group's sale of its airline, on which a new Â£300m bank facility depends. ""Like the auditors we see material uncertainties around the airline sale and the new debt facilities,"" said Citigroup. It also warned that the firm's recent poor performance could ""unsettle consumers and drive further weakness in bookings"". Citigroup's concerns were shared by analysts at Morgan Stanley, which said its worst-case (bear) forecast was also that the firm would be worth zero. However, it said if things went well (bull case), the firm's shares could rise from their current price of around 20p a share to 50p. ""With the share price at 20p, the valuation is discounting something towards in the middle, but we think the bear case is more likely than the bull case,"" it said.

"Kirsty Boden, 28, from Australia, was working as a senior nurse at Guy's Hospital A young woman was killed in the London Bridge attack after she ran to the aid of another victim, telling her friends, ""I'm a nurse, I have to go and help"", an inquest has heard. Kirsty Boden, 28, was stabbed in the head as she knelt over restaurant waiter Alexandre Pigeard as he lay dying, the Old Bailey heard. Footage of her being set upon was shown at the inquest into the deaths of those killed in the London Bridge attack. Eight people died on 3 June 2017. Australian Ms Boden, dubbed the ""angel of London Bridge"", had been out for a meal with two friends when she heard the three attackers' van crash into the railings above and debris falling onto the outside tables. Gareth Patterson QC, the lawyer for her family, said Ms Boden got up within seconds of the crash. The off-duty nurse, who worked at Guy's Hospital, was thinking of others rather than her own safety, he said. A statement from Ms Boden's friend, Melanie Schroeder - one of the friends she was dining with - was read out to the jury on Friday. Ms Schroeder, who had previously asked Ms Boden to be her bridesmaid at her wedding, said: ""Kirsty jumped up and said, 'I'm a nurse. I have to go and help. I need to see if they need help'. ""Kirsty headed off and I thought nothing of it,"" she said. Ms Schroeder said she then remembered hearing screaming and thinking people should calm down because it was ""just a crash"". The friends fled the restaurant with the other diners, and when they returned Ms Schroeder said she saw Ms Boden's body on the ground, which she recognised ""because of her bright pink cardigan"". Ms Boden, who had suffered stab wounds, was alive but unable to speak, Ms Schroeder said. Ms Schroeder and a GP tried to revive her friend, while Ms Mooney attempted to find emergency medical help, but Ms Boden died at their side. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened BBC reporter Hanna Yusuf, at the inquest Dreams, hopes and friendships were terminated on the night Australian nurse Kirsty Boden lost her life. The courtroom watched in awe as footage of a selfless Ms Boden getting up from her dinner with friends - to help victims after hearing a crash - was played. The clips illustrated a night that violently broke up the friendship trio of Ms Boden, Melanie Schroeder and Harriet Mooney. In statements read aloud, Ms Schroeder and Ms Mooney emotively described the night during which they saw their friend die. The desperation in their attempts to save the life of their friend, who was supposed to be Ms Schroeder's bridesmaid, was palpable. There was a collective shudder as the court watched the moment Khuram Butt made a stabbing motion at a faint figure identified as Ms Boden. The court was reminded that the breakdown of moments that seemed lifelong, and were life-changing, happened over a matter of seconds in real time. The inquest heard how Ms Boden was set upon by all three attackers - Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. The three had crashed their car on London Bridge before running through Borough Market. They were shot dead near the market around 10 minutes after their attack began. Lawyer Mr Patterson said the tip of a knife carried by attacker Butt, 27, was later found embedded in Ms Boden's head. The jury heard an account from witness Alexandre Colou, who said he saw the moment Ms Boden fell as crowds of people fled the attackers. ""Her eyes were moving wildly,"" he said. ""She had difficulties breathing. I was talking to her and then her eyes stopped moving. ""I said 'stay awake, stay awake, stay with me'."" Australian au pair Sara Zelenak was beinghelped up by a passer-by after slipping over in her high heels when they were both fatally stabbed. The first person stabbed in the attack, Richard Livett, describedcoming ""nose to nose"" with attacker Khuram Butt, who shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" in his face before stabbing him in the back. PC Mia Kerr recalled howshe discovered victim Sebastien Belanger lying in the streetand used her baton to protect other members of the public from the attackers. Off-duty nurse Helen Kennett told how she asked one of the London Bridge attackerswhat was wrong with himbefore he stabbed her in the neck. She survived the attack. The inquest also heard from British Transport Police constable, Wayne Marques,who previously spoke to the BBCabout being the first officer to confront all three of the attackers. At the inquest, PC Marques told of how he had been on patrol, armed with only a baton, when he ran to the aid of Marie Bondeville, her boyfriend Oliver Dowling, and Richard Livett. He said he was initially alerted by a woman's scream and people running up and down Borough High Street. As he went to investigate, he told the court he was approached by a man running, before finding Richard Livet lying in a pool of blood. He then noticed a man grabbing Ms Bondeville and told the court how the attacker appeared to punch her three or four times, before she fell to the floor, face down. PC Marques then described the moment he saw Mr Dowling being stabbed in the neck. He said: ""I got my baton out and charged the first attacker... my intention was to hit him as hard as I could with all my weight behind me with everything I had. I knew he was trying to kill the man on the floor."" PC Marques said as the first attacker began to ""crumble"" the officer felt an ""almighty blow"" to his head - which impaired his vision. He said: ""At this point I saw a knife coming towards me. Through instinctive reaction I defended myself."" The officer said ""a messy fight"" ensued with the second attacker, before the third ran over. Although PC Marques was stabbed multiple times, he said: ""My job at that stage was to hold on and keep them fighting until the cavalry arrived."" Evidence has so far been heard in relation to six of the victims:Xavier Thomas,Chrissy Archibald,Sara Zelenak,Sebastien Belanger,James McMullanandAlexandre Pigeard.

The jury heard an account from witness Alexandre Colou, who said he saw the moment Ms Boden fell as crowds of people fled the attackers. ""Her eyes were moving wildly,"" he said. ""She had difficulties breathing. I was talking to her and then her eyes stopped moving. ""I said 'stay awake, stay awake, stay with me'."" Australian au pair Sara Zelenak was beinghelped up by a passer-by after slipping over in her high heels when they were both fatally stabbed. The first person stabbed in the attack, Richard Livett, describedcoming ""nose to nose"" with attacker Khuram Butt, who shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" in his face before stabbing him in the back. PC Mia Kerr recalled howshe discovered victim Sebastien Belanger lying in the streetand used her baton to protect other members of the public from the attackers. Off-duty nurse Helen Kennett told how she asked one of the London Bridge attackerswhat was wrong with himbefore he stabbed her in the neck. She survived the attack. The inquest also heard from British Transport Police constable, Wayne Marques,who previously spoke to the BBCabout being the first officer to confront all three of the attackers. At the inquest, PC Marques told of how he had been on patrol, armed with only a baton, when he ran to the aid of Marie Bondeville, her boyfriend Oliver Dowling, and Richard Livett. He said he was initially alerted by a woman's scream and people running up and down Borough High Street. As he went to investigate, he told the court he was approached by a man running, before finding Richard Livet lying in a pool of blood. He then noticed a man grabbing Ms Bondeville and told the court how the attacker appeared to punch her three or four times, before she fell to the floor, face down. PC Marques then described the moment he saw Mr Dowling being stabbed in the neck. He said: ""I got my baton out and charged the first attacker... my intention was to hit him as hard as I could with all my weight behind me with everything I had. I knew he was trying to kill the man on the floor."" PC Marques said as the first attacker began to ""crumble"" the officer felt an ""almighty blow"" to his head - which impaired his vision. He said: ""At this point I saw a knife coming towards me. Through instinctive reaction I defended myself."" The officer said ""a messy fight"" ensued with the second attacker, before the third ran over. Although PC Marques was stabbed multiple times, he said: ""My job at that stage was to hold on and keep them fighting until the cavalry arrived."" Evidence has so far been heard in relation to six of the victims:Xavier Thomas,Chrissy Archibald,Sara Zelenak,Sebastien Belanger,James McMullanandAlexandre Pigeard.

"Ed Henthorn says the drug has ""turned my life upside down"" The parents of young people who have killed themselves and patients unable to have sex are calling for the NHS to stop prescribing acne drug Roaccutane. Ed Henthorn said it had caused him erectile dysfunction, psychosis and suicidal thoughts. And one man who believes his son killed himself after taking the drug said the risks ""are just too high"". Manufacturer Roche said ""millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"". The majority of those who take the drug have a positive experience. ""I used to think about girls... but my feelings, thoughts, just faded away,"" Ed Henthorn told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. He was 19 when he took Roaccutane. He describes his acne as mild but bad enough to want to treat. After three weeks he started to experience side-effects, including reduced energy and sex drive. Then he experienced erectile dysfunction. ""That was why I decided to stop taking it,"" he said. What does the NHS say about Roaccutane? In itsguidance about the options available  for acne treatment,external, the NHS says Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments. The NHS acknowledges there have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking the drug. Its advice says, while there is no evidence these changes were caused by Roaccutane, patients should speak to their doctor immediately if they feel depressed or anxious, or if they have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts. Roaccutane, the brand name the drug isotretinoin is most commonly marketed under, is used by about 30,000 people in the UK each year. Campaigners want it banned from NHS prescriptions, arguing its continuing side-effects mean its risks outweigh the benefits. Mr Henthorn said he still suffers five years after his last dose. He said it had thwarted his hopes of completing university and pursuing a career. ""I had psychosis, psychotic symptoms, suicidal thoughts. It was pretty overwhelming,"" he added. ""My life now is not the best. I'm just kind of at home. The drug's just turned my life upside down."" Derek Jones believes the drug is too dangerous to be prescribed on the NHS Warnings about depression and other psychiatric side-effects were added to the drug's patient information leaflet in 1998. Two years ago, a new warning was added to say some people would be affected by problems getting or maintaining an erection and lower libido. But Roche said while Roaccutane had side-effects - ""like most medications... millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"". It added: ""Isotretinoin was a prescription-only medicine and therefore can only be safely used under the care and supervision of suitably qualified healthcare professionals. ""This way, specialists with the most experience can advise patients about the important safety issues associated with isotretinoin."" Another version of the drug is marketed by Alliance. It said it continually assessed the benefits and risks of its medicines. Many people say it has boosted their self esteem and mental health by treating the acne. Sarah Perkins makes YouTube videos about coping with acne. ""I would go as far as to say it's a wonder drug,"" she says. ""I feel so much happier. I'm confident in my own skin."" Dermatologist Dr Juber Hafiji said it was a very effective treatment for acne. ""In experienced hands it's a very safe treatment, providing the patient is monitored closely, with regular supervision and blood tests at intervals,"" he said. David Healy, professor of psychology at Bangor University, said there were many other drugs that could affect someone's ability to have sex. But the issue with Roaccutane, he added, was how serious the problem could be and how long it could last for. ""It's very, very, important the label makes it clear that these problems can be enduring and also makes it clear that they may only appear after you stop the drug,"" he said. The safety of drugs is governed by the MHRA, and the NHS drug approval body NICE follows its advice. NICE is planning to publish guidance on all acne treatments by 2021 and said it always considered the safety of drugs in its guidelines. The drug can be prescribed in Scotland, although the Scottish Medicines Consortium said it would not have assessed Roaccutane because it predates the creation of the SMC. Jesse Jones died in 2011 Derek Jones's son Jesse had two courses of Roaccutane, and experienced side-effects in relation to his sex drive. It led him to take Viagra, aged 24. Jesse later died, in 2011. The coroner at Jesse's inquest recorded a narrative verdict. His use of Roaccutane was not considered as a contributing factor. But Mr Jones believes his son took his own life. In a draft email found by his parents, Jesse had written: ""Roaccutane seems to have changed the way my mind and body works in a big way. ""I can barely bring myself to type its name because I hate it so much."" Mr Jones, like other campaigners, believes the drug is too dangerous to be prescribed on the NHS. ""A minority get these terrible, terrible side-effects that affect them for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""Should we just ignore this minority group? I think the risks are just too high."" Roche said: ""Isotretinoin product information carries a clear warning that some patients may experience loss of libido and mood changes, including an increase in depression."" It added research by the British Medical Research in 2010 had not established ""an observed increased risk of suicide"" and that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] had concluded in 2014 it was not possible to identify a clear increase in risk of psychiatric disorders. It also said continuing safety reviews in Europe had suggested a causal relationship between isotretinoin, sexual dysfunction and depression was still unclear. An MHRA spokeswoman said it kept the safety of the drug under review, with only consultant dermatologists who had a full understanding of its risks and monitoring requirements able to prescribe it. They added: ""As with all medicines, isotretinoin can cause side effects and these are detailed in the product information provided with the medicine. The possible side effects should be discussed with patients before they are prescribed it.""

"SÃ©amus Lawless is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin A County Wicklow man on a climbing expedition to Mount Everest has been reported missing. SÃ©amus Lawless, 39, from Bray, was part of a team of climbers who reached the peak on Thursday. The search for Mr Lawless has become a recovery operation, the company that organised the climb told Irish broadcaster RTÃ . Mr Lawless is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin. It has been reported that he went missing at an altitude of 8,300 metres, in an area known as ""the balcony"", near the mountain's summit. Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits Treks which organised the trip, told RTÃ: ""It is a very difficult situation. We are searching for a body."" He said that conditions descending the mountain were ""very good"" but that Mr Lawless appears to have fallen accidentally. The GPS worn by Mr Lawless has been found almost 500m from where he fell, but experts have said it is possible the device became detached. Staff at Trinity College issued a statement expressing concern for their colleague. ""SÃ©amus and his family are in our thoughts during this extremely distressing time,"" said a statement from the university. ""This morning his family, friends and colleagues shared his joy on reaching the peak of Mount Everest. ""We hope that Seamus is found safely as soon as possible and until then we will be offering any support we can to his family."" The university had earlier tweeted congratulations to Mr Lawless after he reached the peak of Everest on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, has defended his airline's high ticket prices to fly to Madrid for the Champions League final between Tottenham and Liverpool on 1 June. Football fans complained to BBC Radio 5 Live that flights around that date cost Â£1,000 instead of Â£250 normally. But Mr Lundgren said the price was higher than average because there had been an ""enormous"" surge in demand. ""That is actually how the system works,"" he said. Liverpool and Spurs fans in sponsor plea Champions League: Two weddings and a football final Mr Lundgren said 42 million people had flown with the airline over the winter season, with 65% of them paying Â£50 or less. ""The whole pricing picture is very dynamic,"" he said, adding that at peak booking times, EasyJet could fill a plane in six seconds. ""That's how quickly this goes and this is how the system reacts."" Mr Lundgren added: ""I can understand if people think that the prices are high on this occasion, because it is higher than the average. ""But there's no doubt that this was an occasion where the prices went very high because the demand was enormous."" He maintained that in comparison with other airlines, EasyJet was still offering lower prices, despite the huge increase. If you want to fly from Liverpool to Madrid on 31 May, it will cost you Â£750 one-way. There are no flights available on the day of the match itself, while return flights on 2 and 3 June are sold out. For Spurs fans, EasyJet flights from London Gatwick to Madrid are sold out on 1 June, but seats are still available the day before, at prices ranging from Â£350 to Â£750. All return flights are sold out on 2 June, but evening flights are still available on 3 June, with prices starting at Â£510. Seats on early morning flights from London Luton to Madrid on 1 June are selling at Â£750. Returns on 2 June are sold out, but you could come back on 3 June for Â£550. Other airlines are, of course, available. A typical London-to-Madrid economy fare on British Airways on the morning of 1 June will set you back Â£709, but that price drops to just Â£46 for an evening flight - which would get you in too late to see the match. Peter, Liverpool fan I live in Hong Kong, but I'm going to be in the UK on business. I bought my airline ticket on BA from London Heathrow to Madrid immediately after Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 in the second leg of the semi-final. The tickets had already gone up six-fold within a couple of hours, from about Â£100 to Â£600 return. I'm going the day before and I'm coming back the day after, very early in the morning. It was even difficult to get the hotel. It's just an average hotel by the airport, ordinarily â¬120 a night, and that was â¬600-plus a night. We live in a world of shameless greed, but who, if they could, wouldn't take this opportunity to make money? It's solely about supply and demand. I'm lucky in the fact I can even afford this, but I do not envy the Chelsea and Arsenal fans who will travel to Baku for the Europa League final. Mr Lundgren's comments came after EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss in the same period a year earlier. The airline said cost per seat had gone up 3.9% due to fuel price increases and the impact of currency movements, while revenue per seat had fallen by 6.3% to Â£50.71. Easyjet also said had it suffered from ""the impact of drones at Gatwick in December"", which it said had cost it Â£10m. In April, EasyJet had warned about ""weak"" summer sales amid Brexit uncertainty. In its latest results, the carrier said revenue per seat in the second half of the year would be slightly lower. ""This is not helped by the ongoing negative impact of Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider macroeconomic slowdown in Europe,"" it said.

"Israel Folau has won 73 caps for Australia Israel Folau's contract has been terminated by Rugby Australia after he said ""hell awaits"" gay people in asocial media post. The full-back, 30, was sacked in April but requested a hearing, which was heard by a three-person panel. The panel found him guilty of a ""high level breach"" of RA's player code of conduct and upheld the dismissal. Folau, who had a RA deal until 2022, has 72 hours to appeal against the ruling and is considering his options. An appeal would mean a second code of conduct hearing with the same evidence but a new panel, while he could also try to take his case to a regional Supreme Court, or even the High Court of Australia. The fundamentalist Christian posted a banner on his Instagram account in April that read: ""Drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolators - Hell awaits you."" New South Wales Waratahs' Folau, who escaped punishment for similar comments last year, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by RA's decision. ""It has been a privilege and an honour to represent Australia and my home state of New South Wales, playing the game I love,"" he said in a statement. ""As Australians, we are born with certain rights, including the right to freedom of religion and the right to freedom of expression. ""The Christian faith has always been a part of my life and I believe it is my duty as a Christian to share God's word. ""Upholding my religious beliefs should not prevent my ability to work or play for my club and country."" Folau, RA chief executive Raelene Castle, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika and New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU) chief executive Andrew Hore all gave evidence at the three-day hearing earlier this month. The panel then took written submissions before deciding on Folau's punishment. ""This outcome is a painful situation for the game,"" said Castle. ""Rugby Australia did not choose to be in the situation, but Rugby Australia's position remains that Israel, through his actions, left us with no choice but to pursue the course of action resulting in today's outcome."" Folau was expected to play at this year's World Cup in Japan but Cheika has said he is unlikely to be selected for Australia again. ""This issue has created an unwanted distraction in an important year for the sport and for the Wallabies team,"" added Castle. ""But our clear message for all rugby fans is that we need to stand by our values and the qualities of inclusion, passion, integrity, discipline, respect and teamwork."" NSWRU boss Hore said: ""While NSWRU is disappointed to lose a player of Israel's calibre, rugby has a code of conduct and values that we must adhere to ensure that our game remains a game for all, no matter people's background or beliefs."" In addition to his rugby union career, Folau has also played professional rugby league and Australian rules football. In April, Australian rugby league's governing body ruled out Folau returning to the NRL. He has recently lost sponsorship deals with Land Rover, who withdrew a car issued to him, and sportswear brand Asics. Rugby Australia is a foundation member of Pride in Sport Index (PSI), which is a programme in Australia set up to help sporting organisations with the inclusion of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community. ""We commend Rugby Australia, as well as New South Wales Rugby Union, for their leadership and courage throughout this process,"" said PSI co-founder Andrew Purchas.

"Online giant Amazon has announced a big investment in food courier Deliveroo. The exact figure was not given, but Amazon is the biggest investor in Deliveroo's latest round of fund raising, which in total raised $575m (Â£450m). Deliveroo said it would use the money for international expansion, improving its service and to grow itsdelivery-only kitchens business. Several existing US investors also contributed to the fund raising. The amount of capital invested in Deliveroo since it was founded in 2013 now totals more than $1.5bn, and the firm is one of Europe's fastest growing technology companies. Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu said he was looking forward to working with ""such a customer-obsessed organisation"" like Amazon. Amazon said it was attracted by Deliveroo's ""innovative technology service"". The backing from Amazon gives Deliveroo a boost against rivals such as JustEat and Uber Eats. The online retailer briefly had its own UK food delivery venture, Amazon Restaurants UK, which it started in 2016 but closed just two years later. ""They [Amazon] weren't able to compete within the market so they've gone for the buying option instead. They've got the money behind them to do that,"" Louise Dudley, fund manager at investment firm Hermes, told the BBC's Today programme. ""It [Deliveroo] is not just a food delivery company it's very much a tech company. They have this tech platform that is seen is very attractive. They are able to expand into new areas and think about how people's tastes are evolving and be able to predict what stores will be successful. That predictive growth is very attractive to Amazon"". Amazon had previously been reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright.Uber also reportedly had talks with Deliverooover buying it. It was already a fierce contest - now the battle to dominate the food delivery business in the UK just  moved to a whole new level. In a rare failure Amazon decided last year to pull its Restaurants food service out of a UK market where Deliveroo, Just Eat and  Uber Eats were scrapping to be top dog. Now it's put its firepower behind Deliveroo, which was already confident that its technology platform gave it the edge. The company will now use some of its extra cash to build more of its ""super kitchens"" expanding its offering beyond traditional restaurants and invest more in machine learning to speed up delivery times. Whether the market for food deliveries is quite as big as all the firms believe - and whether it stretches far beyond London twenty-somethings - remains to be seen but they all seem prepared to spend big money to win the lion's share. The question is why did Amazon not just buy the whole business? Perhaps the ecommerce giant wanted to sample a starter before swallowing the whole three course meal. Deliveroo now operates in more than 100 towns and cities across the UK, but has a much smaller share of the market than rival Just Eat which dominates the food delivery sector. Just Eat's sharesfell 8% in early trading, but analysts at Liberum said that despite the extra funding, Deliveroo was unlikely to become a serious competitor. ""Just Eat's market leading position will be incredibly difficult to overcome, especially given its strength in smaller towns. ""In the UK, it has an estimated 3-4 times greater share than Uber Eats and Deliveroo combined and, crucially, 60%+ of its customers are in small towns where it is effectively the only option for restaurants and where the Uber Eats/Deliveroo model just doesn't work because of the economics,"" Liberum said. Will Shu co-founded Deliveroo in 2013 Mr Shu came up with the idea for the firm after he moved from New York to London as a banking analyst. He was working long hours and was frustrated by the fact so few restaurants delivered, a service he had used daily in the US. In the firm's early days, Mr Shu delivered all the food himself on a motorbike, while Greg Orlowski, his co-founder who has since left the business, developed the booking technology from his home in the US. Mr Shu still claims to get on his bike once a week to deliver an order to customers in London, as a way of staying in touch with riders. As well as the UK, Deliveroo now operates in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Global sales at the firm more than doubled in 2017,jumping to Â£277m, but its losses continued to increase, doubling to nearly Â£185m as it invested in global expansion. The firm uses more than 60,000 couriers - mostly using bikes or moped - to deliver food from restaurants to customers. Deliveroo does not employ its riders directly, but pays them per delivery. Last year, a group of 50 UK Deliveroo couriers won a six-figure payout after claiming they had been unlawfully denied holiday and minimum wages. Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'?

"Bus tickets need to be cheaper and easier to buy using contactless and smart phones to attract young people, according to the UK transport watchdog. Despite being the biggest users of buses 16-18 year-olds are also the least satisfied, Transport Focus found. The watchdog also recommended companies should install wi-fi and USB charging points on board, to encourage younger people to travel on buses. Bus companies said they were investing in services young people expect. Graham Vidler, chief executive of CPT UK, the trade association which represents bus and coach operators, said the industry recognised the importance of meeting the expectations of younger travellers. Onboard facilities including contactless and mobile ticketing, wi-fi, USB charging points and leather seating were now ""commonplace"" on many services, he added. Bus journeys fall by 90 million Reality Check: Does your council have to keep the buses running? Transport Focus director David Sidebottom agreed more bus operators and local authorities were pursuing initiatives that encouraged young people to catch the bus. But he added that young people didn't feel services were designed for them. ""Young people want using the bus to be as simple and intuitive as ordering pizza. Bus operators and local authorities must seize the opportunity to cater for their customers of the future."" In its reportMaking Bus a Better Choice For Young People,externalTransport Focus recommends bus companies should introduce: Smart fares - cheaper fares for 16 to 18-year-olds that are easy to buy and understand A nationwide simple-to-use smartphone bus app, providing information and ticketing Wi-fi and USB points at every seat Transport Focus gave the example of a flat fare of Â£2.20 for unlimited travel in and around Liverpool, which it said had led to a significant rise in the number of under 18-year-olds using buses. CPT UK's Mr Vidler welcomed the report's recommendations and said the latest satisfaction statistics ""clearly demonstrate that the industry is moving in the right direction"". However, he added there was ""always room for improvement"". The organisation looked forward to ""continuing to work closely with its members, central and local government to further improve the experience of all bus users"", he said. Buses minister Nusrat Ghani said the Transport Focus research was ""vital"" in showing how to encourage young people to continue to use buses in the future. ""Both councils and bus companies should follow this best practice,"" she said. ""We're also funding a new open data platform so companies can develop apps to help passengers find out where their bus is, how long it will take, and how much it will cost, giving them more confidence to take the bus,"" Ms Ghani added.

"More than two-thirds of LGBT people in the UK have been sexually harassed at work, a survey suggests. Of 1,151 LGBT people polled by the Trades Union Congress, 68% said they had experienced harassment, with 42% saying colleagues had made unwanted comments about their sex life. More than a quarter (27%) said they had received unwelcome sexual advances. The government said it was planning to shortly consult on how to strengthen existing laws on harassment. The survey - released on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia - was conducted by the Trade Union Congress and is believed to be the first major study into LGBT sexual harassment at work in the UK. Are you being sexually harassed at work? When does flirting become sexual harassment? According to the survey, of the 68% who said they had experienced sexual harassment, 66% did not tell their employer, sometimes because they were afraid of being ""outed"" at work. The figure of 68% for LGBT people in the TUC's survey compares with a figure of 37% for the wider population in a BBC survey carried out in 2017. Of the 2,031 British adults questioned for BBC Radio 5 Live 53% of women and 20% of men said they had experienced sexual harassment,ranging from inappropriate comments to actual sexual assaults, at work or a place of study. Helen describes herself as pansexual. She works as a psychologist and says she regularly experiences sexual harassment at work. ""Recently I was working out in the gym at work and two male colleagues were standing behind me. One said, 'She's such a waste of a woman,' referring to the fact I am in a relationship with a woman. ""When I was leaving the gym one of them asked me, 'Is it because you've never had a real man?' He laughed and then they both wolf-whistled at me. I haven't been back to the work gym since."" Helen said the sexual harassment she has experienced hasn't only been verbal. ""I returned home early from my work Christmas party because a colleague asked to see a picture of my partner. ""When I showed him my Facebook profile picture, he said, 'I would pay Â£100 to watch you two.' I was really upset and he said, 'Don't be touchy,' and slapped my bum as I walked off."" Helen also has concerns about what reporting sexual harassment would mean for her at work. She said: ""I worry what it might do for my reputation and my chances of career progression to report these incidents."" For some people who have suffered sexual harassment at work, reporting their experiences did not make things easier. Patrick, not his real name, works in the public sector. He says he has endured years of sexual harassment. ""After a colleague found out I was gay, he asked me how much I charge as a rent boy. I reported it but nothing came of it. After an investigation into his experiences, Patrick's work life impacted his personal life too. ""All of my team were preparing for an away day, which was going to involve different sports activities. ""A few weeks before the away day, I was pulled into an office and told that the others didn't want to do the activities with me as they'd be uncomfortable about taking showers with me there. ""I was told I wouldn't be going on the away day. I reported it and I was off work for over a year during the investigation. The investigation outed me to my family."" Patrick says he went on to try to take his life twice. The TUC survey also suggested LGBT women were more likely to experience unwanted touching and sexual assault at work than men. Over a third of the women (35%) surveyed had experienced unwanted touching, for example placing hands on their lower back or knee. One in eight (12%) had been seriously sexually assaulted or raped at work. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the research revealed a ""hidden epidemic"" of LGBT abuse. She said: ""In 2019 LGBT people should be safe and supported at work. But instead they're experiencing shockingly high levels of sexual harassment and assault."" ""Workplace culture needs to change."" She said the government needed to ""change the law to put the responsibility for preventing harassment on employers, not victims"". Laura Russell, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall, said the figures were ""shocking"", but added: ""We know from our own research and this report that LGBT people still face abuse and discrimination in Britain's workplaces."" A Government Equalities Office spokesperson said: ""It is appalling LGBT people are suffering this harassment. Workplaces should be safe, supportive environments for everybody. ""The government will consult shortly on how we can strengthen and clarify existing laws on third-party harassment, as well as making sure employers fully understand their legal responsibility to protect their staff.""

"SÃ©amus Lawless is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin A County Wicklow man on a climbing expedition to Mount Everest has been reported missing. SÃ©amus Lawless, 39, from Bray, was part of a team of climbers who reached the peak on Thursday. The search for Mr Lawless has become a recovery operation, the company that organised the climb told Irish broadcaster RTÃ . Mr Lawless is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin. It has been reported that he went missing at an altitude of 8,300 metres, in an area known as ""the balcony"", near the mountain's summit. Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits Treks which organised the trip, told RTÃ: ""It is a very difficult situation. We are searching for a body."" He said that conditions descending the mountain were ""very good"" but that Mr Lawless appears to have fallen accidentally. The GPS worn by Mr Lawless has been found almost 500m from where he fell, but experts have said it is possible the device became detached. Staff at Trinity College issued a statement expressing concern for their colleague. ""SÃ©amus and his family are in our thoughts during this extremely distressing time,"" said a statement from the university. ""This morning his family, friends and colleagues shared his joy on reaching the peak of Mount Everest. ""We hope that Seamus is found safely as soon as possible and until then we will be offering any support we can to his family."" The university had earlier tweeted congratulations to Mr Lawless after he reached the peak of Everest on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ed Henthorn says the drug has ""turned my life upside down"" The parents of young people who have killed themselves and patients unable to have sex are calling for the NHS to stop prescribing acne drug Roaccutane. Ed Henthorn said it had caused him erectile dysfunction, psychosis and suicidal thoughts. And one man who believes his son killed himself after taking the drug said the risks ""are just too high"". Manufacturer Roche said ""millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"". The majority of those who take the drug have a positive experience. ""I used to think about girls... but my feelings, thoughts, just faded away,"" Ed Henthorn told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. He was 19 when he took Roaccutane. He describes his acne as mild but bad enough to want to treat. After three weeks he started to experience side-effects, including reduced energy and sex drive. Then he experienced erectile dysfunction. ""That was why I decided to stop taking it,"" he said. What does the NHS say about Roaccutane? In itsguidance about the options available  for acne treatment,external, the NHS says Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments. The NHS acknowledges there have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking the drug. Its advice says, while there is no evidence these changes were caused by Roaccutane, patients should speak to their doctor immediately if they feel depressed or anxious, or if they have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts. Roaccutane, the brand name the drug isotretinoin is most commonly marketed under, is used by about 30,000 people in the UK each year. Campaigners want it banned from NHS prescriptions, arguing its continuing side-effects mean its risks outweigh the benefits. Mr Henthorn said he still suffers five years after his last dose. He said it had thwarted his hopes of completing university and pursuing a career. ""I had psychosis, psychotic symptoms, suicidal thoughts. It was pretty overwhelming,"" he added. ""My life now is not the best. I'm just kind of at home. The drug's just turned my life upside down."" Derek Jones believes the drug is too dangerous to be prescribed on the NHS Warnings about depression and other psychiatric side-effects were added to the drug's patient information leaflet in 1998. Two years ago, a new warning was added to say some people would be affected by problems getting or maintaining an erection and lower libido. But Roche said while Roaccutane had side-effects - ""like most medications... millions of patients worldwide have benefited from taking the drug"". It added: ""Isotretinoin was a prescription-only medicine and therefore can only be safely used under the care and supervision of suitably qualified healthcare professionals. ""This way, specialists with the most experience can advise patients about the important safety issues associated with isotretinoin."" Another version of the drug is marketed by Alliance. It said it continually assessed the benefits and risks of its medicines. Many people say it has boosted their self esteem and mental health by treating the acne. Sarah Perkins makes YouTube videos about coping with acne. ""I would go as far as to say it's a wonder drug,"" she says. ""I feel so much happier. I'm confident in my own skin."" Dermatologist Dr Juber Hafiji said it was a very effective treatment for acne. ""In experienced hands it's a very safe treatment, providing the patient is monitored closely, with regular supervision and blood tests at intervals,"" he said. David Healy, professor of psychology at Bangor University, said there were many other drugs that could affect someone's ability to have sex. But the issue with Roaccutane, he added, was how serious the problem could be and how long it could last for. ""It's very, very, important the label makes it clear that these problems can be enduring and also makes it clear that they may only appear after you stop the drug,"" he said. The safety of drugs is governed by the MHRA, and the NHS drug approval body NICE follows its advice. NICE is planning to publish guidance on all acne treatments by 2021 and said it always considered the safety of drugs in its guidelines. The drug can be prescribed in Scotland, although the Scottish Medicines Consortium said it would not have assessed Roaccutane because it predates the creation of the SMC. Jesse Jones died in 2011 Derek Jones's son Jesse had two courses of Roaccutane, and experienced side-effects in relation to his sex drive. It led him to take Viagra, aged 24. Jesse later died, in 2011. The coroner at Jesse's inquest recorded a narrative verdict. His use of Roaccutane was not considered as a contributing factor. But Mr Jones believes his son took his own life. In a draft email found by his parents, Jesse had written: ""Roaccutane seems to have changed the way my mind and body works in a big way. ""I can barely bring myself to type its name because I hate it so much."" Mr Jones, like other campaigners, believes the drug is too dangerous to be prescribed on the NHS. ""A minority get these terrible, terrible side-effects that affect them for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""Should we just ignore this minority group? I think the risks are just too high."" Roche said: ""Isotretinoin product information carries a clear warning that some patients may experience loss of libido and mood changes, including an increase in depression."" It added research by the British Medical Research in 2010 had not established ""an observed increased risk of suicide"" and that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [MHRA] had concluded in 2014 it was not possible to identify a clear increase in risk of psychiatric disorders. It also said continuing safety reviews in Europe had suggested a causal relationship between isotretinoin, sexual dysfunction and depression was still unclear. An MHRA spokeswoman said it kept the safety of the drug under review, with only consultant dermatologists who had a full understanding of its risks and monitoring requirements able to prescribe it. They added: ""As with all medicines, isotretinoin can cause side effects and these are detailed in the product information provided with the medicine. The possible side effects should be discussed with patients before they are prescribed it.""

"Online giant Amazon has announced a big investment in food courier Deliveroo. The exact figure was not given, but Amazon is the biggest investor in Deliveroo's latest round of fund raising, which in total raised $575m (Â£450m). Deliveroo said it would use the money for international expansion, improving its service and to grow itsdelivery-only kitchens business. Several existing US investors also contributed to the fund raising. The amount of capital invested in Deliveroo since it was founded in 2013 now totals more than $1.5bn, and the firm is one of Europe's fastest growing technology companies. Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu said he was looking forward to working with ""such a customer-obsessed organisation"" like Amazon. Amazon said it was attracted by Deliveroo's ""innovative technology service"". The backing from Amazon gives Deliveroo a boost against rivals such as JustEat and Uber Eats. The online retailer briefly had its own UK food delivery venture, Amazon Restaurants UK, which it started in 2016 but closed just two years later. ""They [Amazon] weren't able to compete within the market so they've gone for the buying option instead. They've got the money behind them to do that,"" Louise Dudley, fund manager at investment firm Hermes, told the BBC's Today programme. ""It [Deliveroo] is not just a food delivery company it's very much a tech company. They have this tech platform that is seen is very attractive. They are able to expand into new areas and think about how people's tastes are evolving and be able to predict what stores will be successful. That predictive growth is very attractive to Amazon"". Amazon had previously been reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright.Uber also reportedly had talks with Deliverooover buying it. It was already a fierce contest - now the battle to dominate the food delivery business in the UK just  moved to a whole new level. In a rare failure Amazon decided last year to pull its Restaurants food service out of a UK market where Deliveroo, Just Eat and  Uber Eats were scrapping to be top dog. Now it's put its firepower behind Deliveroo, which was already confident that its technology platform gave it the edge. The company will now use some of its extra cash to build more of its ""super kitchens"" expanding its offering beyond traditional restaurants and invest more in machine learning to speed up delivery times. Whether the market for food deliveries is quite as big as all the firms believe - and whether it stretches far beyond London twenty-somethings - remains to be seen but they all seem prepared to spend big money to win the lion's share. The question is why did Amazon not just buy the whole business? Perhaps the ecommerce giant wanted to sample a starter before swallowing the whole three course meal. Deliveroo now operates in more than 100 towns and cities across the UK, but has a much smaller share of the market than rival Just Eat which dominates the food delivery sector. Just Eat's sharesfell 8% in early trading, but analysts at Liberum said that despite the extra funding, Deliveroo was unlikely to become a serious competitor. ""Just Eat's market leading position will be incredibly difficult to overcome, especially given its strength in smaller towns.

"One hundred people have been fatally stabbed in the UK so far this year. The first death was 33-year-old mother Charlotte Huggins, who died in London just a few hours after celebrating the start of the new year. The 100th death was John Lewis, 32, who died in Middlesbrough on the evening of 14 May. Those killed in 2019 range in age from 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, who was stabbed in Leyton, east London in January - to 80-year-old Barbara Heywood, who was attacked at her home in Bolton in March. Almost half of the victims were under 30 and were overwhelmingly male. Knife crime in England and Wales rose to record levelsin 2017-18 withthe number of fatal stabbings the highest since Home Office records beganin 1946. There has been one fatal stabbing every 1.45 days so far this year in England and Wales.  If killings continued at that rate for the rest of the year, the total would be slightly lower than the 285 stabbing deaths recorded in 2017-18. Thirty of the fatal stabbings were in London, 10 in Greater Manchester and eight in the West Midlands. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The police have made arrests in nearly all of the cases and have charged suspects in 86. Below are the details and, where available, photos of those who have lost their lives so far this year. Thirty-three-year-old mother Charlotte Huggins died just a few hours after celebrating the start of the new year. She was stabbed at a residential address in south London and died at the scene. In a message posted on Facebook shortly before being attacked, Ms Huggins had wished her friends and family a ""healthy, happy 2019"". Her boyfriend Michael Rolle is due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on 1 July after pleading not guilty to Ms Hugginsâ murder. Tudor Simionov, 33, had recently moved from Romania to east London with his girlfriend. On New Yearâs Eve, he was working as a doorman at a private party in Mayfair. Mr Simionov was stabbed to death in the early hours of 1 January when a group of men tried to gatecrash the party. A woman and two of his male colleagues were also found with stab injuries. Haroon Akram, Adham Khalil, Adham Elshalakany, and Nor Aden Hamada will appear at the Old Bailey on 1 July to face charges of Mr Simionovâs murder, as well as two counts of attempted murder and two counts of GBH. Computer programmer Lee Pomeroy, 51, died after being attacked on a South Western Railway train bound for London Waterloo. Described as a âdevoted family manâ, Mr Pomeroy had been heading to London from Guildford for a day out with his 14-year-old son when he was stabbed nine times on the train. Darren Pencille is due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on 24 June to face charges of murder. Jaden Moodie became the first teenager to be stabbed to death in the UK in 2019 when he was knocked off a moped and attacked in Leyton, east London.

The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims Analysis by Reality Check The number of people being taken to court for possessing a weapon has been rising. There's a bit of a time lag when it comes to getting figures from the criminal justice system, so the latest ones we have, published on Thursday, only take us up to the end of last year. In 2018, the Ministry of Justice recorded 21,587 cases of people in England Wales being prosecuted for possessing a weapon, of which 13,350 cases led to a conviction - compared with 17,669 cases in 2013 - with 10,026 leading to a conviction. This was mostly driven by a rise in the offence of ""having possession of a bladed article in a public place"". For adults, the maximum sentence for possessing a knife is four years. Knife possession is now making up a bigger share of all weapons offences - two-thirds compared with half 10 years ago. And a bigger proportion of knife and weapons possession offences now result in jail time - 36% compared with 20% in 2008. These figures cover both adults and children aged 10-17. For adults only, 42% of weapons offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence last year. While knife possession offences have been rising since 2013, they are still lower than a decade ago. About these figures Information supplied by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Figures are correct at time of publication but may change as investigations progress and charges are brought or dropped. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Theresa May has promised to set a timetable for the election of her successor after the next Brexit vote in the first week of June. The agreement follows a meeting between the prime minister and senior Tory MPs who are demanding a date for her departure from Downing Street. If she loses the vote on her Brexit plan, already rejected three times, sources told the BBC she would resign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has said he will run for leader once Mrs May goes. The prime minister survived a confidence vote by Conservative MPs at the end of last year and party rules mean she cannot formally be challenged again until December. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? But Mrs May has come under increasing pressure to leave Downing Street this summer, amid the Brexit impasse and poor results for the Conservatives in the recent local elections in England. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior sources had told her it was ""inconceivable"" the prime minister could remain in office if MPs rejected her Brexit plans for a fourth time. ""Discussing an election timetable"" doesn't sound that exciting. But the paragraph tucked into the short formal letter from Sir Graham Brady to Tory MPs all but marks the end of Theresa May's premiership and the beginning of the official hunt for the next leader of the country. After the lines in the short note restate the prime minister's determination to get Brexit done, it confirms in black and white that after the next big vote, in the first week of June, the prime minister will make plans with the party for choosing a successor. Right now, the expectation is that vote will be lost (although it is not impossible, of course, that Number 10 could turn it round). And the conversation that's been arranged won't just be a gentle chat about what to do next. Senior sources have told me that means, even though the letter doesn't spell it out, that if her Brexit plan is defeated again, Mrs May will announce she is going. Read more from Laura The chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he had reached an agreement over the prime minister's future during ""very frank"" talks in Parliament. He said the committee's executive and Mrs May would meet again to discuss her future following the first debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Sir Graham said there was now ""greater clarity"" about the situation. Johnson confirms bid for Tory leadership MPs 'have duty to support Brexit bill' What happens next? Asked if that meant the prime minister would quit immediately if MPs rejected her Brexit plans once more, he said that scenario went ""beyond"" what had been agreed. MPs have rejected the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU three times. But she will have another go at gaining their support in the week beginning 3 June, when the Commons votes for the first time on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation needed to implement her deal with the EU. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: PM will announce departure timetable in early June Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined the growing list of Conservatives who say they will stand for leader when Mrs May announces her departure. He told a business conference in Manchester: ""Of course I am going to go for it."" Conservative MP Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement that a timetable would be set out for Mrs May's departure, suggesting it would inject greater ambition and dynamism into the Brexit process. The former party chairman told BBC News the Brexit bill had no chance of passing in its current state but holding another vote would allow Mrs May to demonstrate she had ""tried everything"". ""It is right to bring this whole saga to a conclusion,"" he said. This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister But fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who backs another Brexit referendum, said replacing the prime minister would not ""solve the crisis"" the UK found itself in or build a parliamentary majority for the terms of the UK's departure. ""Forcing the PM's resignation and spending this summer locked in a leadership election where candidates trade ever more fantastic visions of unicorn Brexitsâ¦is neither in the interests of the Conservative Party nor of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Last month,the 1922 Committee executive narrowly decided against changing the party's leadership rulesto allow an early challenge to Mrs May. Local Tory associations have confirmedthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June, although its result will not be binding. Much of the anger in the Conservative parliamentary party is focusing on the prime minister's talks with Labour, aimed at reaching a cross-party compromise to get her deal through the Commons. BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said he understood the talks will ""soon be drawing to a close"" adding that Tory whips had ""given up on this phase of the negotiations and are looking to pack the legislation with goodies for Brexiteers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill unless it guaranteed membership of a customs union with the EU, and protected workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental rights. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""happily support"" the legislation, provided it was subject to a ""confirmatory public vote"".

"Talks between Labour and the government aimed at breaking the Brexit impasse have ended without an agreement. Jeremy Corbyn said the discussions had ""gone as far as they can"", blaming what he called the government's ""increasing weakness and instability"". Theresa May said the lack of a ""common position"" within Labour over a further referendum had made talks ""difficult"". The prime minister said she would now consider putting options to MPs on Brexit that may ""command a majority"". But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the end of the talks a ""very negative development"". Watson: PM's plan might not be dead yet Pienaar: PM's steady diet of faint hope Pound hits four-month low as talks end Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May has promised to set a timetable for leaving Downing Streetfollowing a House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March - but after MPs voted down the deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc three times, the EU gave the UK an extension until 31 October. This prompted negotiations between the Conservatives and Labour to see if the parties could come to a Brexit agreement, despite differences over issues including membership of a customs union and a further referendum. The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Read the full article But in a letter to the prime minister, Labour leader Mr Corbyn wrote: ""I believe the talks between us about finding a compromise agreement on leaving the European Union have now gone as far as they can."" The move towards choosing her replacement meant ""the position of the government has become ever more unstable"". He later said his party had negotiated ""in good faith and very seriously, and put forward a lot of very detailed arguments"", which he thought was ""the responsible thing to do"". He added: ""The issue [is] that the government has not fundamentally shifted its view and the divisions in the Conservative Party mean the government is negotiating with no authority and no ability that I can see to actually deliver anything."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Government hasn't shifted its view Speaking after meeting Tory activists in Bristol, Mrs May said: ""There have been areas where we have been able to find common ground, but other issues have proved to be more difficult. ""In particular, we haven't been able to overcome the fact that there isn't a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum to reverse it."" She said the government would consider what had come out of the meetings with Labour and ""consider whether we have some votes to see if the ideas that have come through command a majority in the House of Commons"". This video can not be played Theresa May: There isn't a common position in Labour for Brexit Labour's favoured plan includes a permanent customs union with the EU, meaning no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods sold between the UK and the rest of the bloc. It also keeps the option of a further referendum on the table, giving the public a say on the deal agreed by Parliament. Both scenarios have caused anger among Brexit-backing Conservatives, who claim a customs union would prevent the UK from negotiating its own trade deals around the world after leaving the EU, and who believe another public vote is undemocratic. Some MPs have also criticised Mrs May for even entering into talks with Labour, but the prime minister said the government had ""no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons"". Before the talks with Labour, the prime minister - whose Conservative Party does not have a majority in the Commons - failed to get her deal through three times, by margins of 230, 149 and 58 votes. The DUP, whichsupports her government on certain issues,opposes Mrs May's agreement with the EU over its implications for Northern Ireland. Following the collapse of the discussions with Labour, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""This round of talks has wasted time rather than making progress and reducing uncertainty. It was always doomed to failure.""

He tweeted: ""She knows the reality is she couldn't carry her own side or offer a realistic compromise. Any deal agreed wouldn't last a day under a new Tory leader."" But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government had moved in some areas - specifically on workers' rights and environmental standards - and had been ""having discussions around where we were on customs arrangements"". He said senior Labour figures like Sir Keir had been insisting on a further referendum on any deal, adding: ""It begs the question why have they taken six [or] seven weeks for talks?"" Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable criticised both of the main parties, tweeting: ""The weakness of the government and the vacillation of the Labour Party put their talks on very shaky ground from the beginning."" The director general of the CBI business group, Carolyn Fairbairn, called the end of the talks ""another day of failed politics"" and ""another dispiriting day"". She called for Parliament's recess at the end of this month to be cancelled, adding: ""This is no time for holidays. It's time to get on with it."" On Thursday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson became the latest MP to put his name forward as a possible successor to Mrs May. Asked by reporters on Friday if he would be running for the leadership, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it was now time for colleagues to ""focus"" on delivering Brexit.
