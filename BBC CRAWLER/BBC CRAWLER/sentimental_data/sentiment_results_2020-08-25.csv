"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said experts had been asked for new advice on face masks in schools A decision about whether children will need to wear face coverings to school in Wales will be made on Wednesday, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said he wanted any change to guidance on the mandatory use of face coverings to be made before schools reopen next Tuesday. InScotland secondary pupils will have to wear masksin school corridors. Andthe UK government performed a U-turnand changed its guidance against using face masks in schools in England. ""I've asked the children and schools advisory group of our scientific advisory group to consider the current guidance here in Wales,"" Mr Gething said at Tuesday's weekly briefing. ""They will look at any additional risks and benefits [to] children, young people and staff from the wearing of face coverings in school settings."" Vaughan Gething says it is important any changes are announced sooner rather than later On Tuesday, the Welsh Government's scientific advisory group was asked to review the risks of using masks in schools followingan update in guidance from the World Health Organization,externaland the changes in Scotland. Mr Gething said the advisory group would provide ministers with updated advice later on Tuesday, and he hoped to deliver any decision to change the rules in Wales by the end of Wednesday. He said the Scottish government had announced changes after schools had ""essentially been open for two weeks"", and that it was important any changes were announced sooner rather than later. Mr Gething added it was important any decisions were ""proportionate"" and ""appropriate to their setting, and local population"". Julie Richards says her daughter ""can't afford to have another six months out of school"" Julie Richards, whose 14-year-old daughter is due to return to Ysgol Garth Olwg in Pontypridd next week, said she supported the idea of wearing masks to school. ""For me, my daughter's going into Year 10 - it's a very important year,"" Ms Richards said. ""She can't afford to have another six months out of school."" Another mother said that while she agreed with children wearing face masks on school buses, she did not think children should have to wear them in corridors or communal areas. ""It's just quite uncomfortable,"" said Tracey Elsam, a healthcare worker whose daughter goes to school in the Vale of Glamorgan. ""I'm not worried about [wearing a face mask] causing damage to her health, it's just discomfort."" ""Our background rate is low, so we must consider the balance of harm, especially for children and young people with additional needs,"" he added. Adults and background transmissions play a ""significant role"" in school outbreaks, he said, so control measures like social distancing and staggered starts, reducing mixing and staying in smaller groups would need to be observed. In a statement, the Welsh Government said its advice, which would be ""kept under constant review"", was that face coverings should be worn ""where it may be difficult to stay 2m away from others"".

"Sally Collier appeared before the education select committee by webcam in June The head of England's exams regulator, Sally Collier, has quit after thousands of students' marks were downgraded for exams they were unable to sit. Ofqual chief Ms Collier has been under fire for a controversial algorithm which changed GCSE and A-level marks, making them unfair, according to heads. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson thanked her for her commitment. He added: ""Moving forward, my department will continue to work closely with Ofqual's leadership to deliver fair results and exams for young people."" Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid' Students to be offered first choice places After the exams U-turn - what happens next? But teaching unions say questions remain for ministers about the fiasco, despite Ms Collier's resignation. ""This move follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year's grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone,"" said the head of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton. ""Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right."" Meanwhile, National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""Someone had to take responsibility for the exams fiasco, but the issue runs far deeper than the actions of one chief executive. ""We have no sure way of knowing where the balance of fault lies, but we can be quite certain that Gavin Williamson gave direction to Ofqual that there should not be grade inflation and all candidates should get a fair grade."" The previous chief of Ofqual, Dame Glenys Stacey, has been asked to step in. She will run the next stage of the exams process on a temporary basis until December, the Ofqual board said, along with the chief of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, who previously worked at Ofqual. Exams for GCSE and A-level students were cancelled by Mr Williamson in March, just before schools were closed, when the nation was in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic. A system to ensure pupils could still get their grades was drawn up by Ofqual which involved teachers and schools predicting grades for their pupils from a whole range of evidence These were then sent to the exams regulator to be moderated so as to avoid more students than usual getting higher grades. The now discredited algorithm used information on schools' past performance to moderate the grades, drawing complaints that pupils were being judged on the efforts of the predecessors. How did the exam algorithm work? Scotland, which used a similar system, rowed back on the arrangement after it became apparent that many bright but disadvantaged pupils were downgraded. Scotland's education secretary John Swinney announced a switch to teacher-assessed grades and results were re-issued. But it was not until two weeks afterthose results were awardedthat his counterpart in England, Gavin Williamson, decided to revert to what are known as centre-assessed grades. Sally Collier refused requests for interviews last week This meant that hundreds of thousands of A-level results had to be re-issued and GCSE results were rushed through to schools to be released three days after the government U-turn. And hundreds of thousands of the BTec students have still not received their grades after the exam board, Pearson, made a last minute decision to re-grade. Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons education committee, said Ms Collier agreed to appear before MPs next week only a few days ago. ""I want her still to come because we want to find out, while she was in charge, what went on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""I very much hope that will be the case."" He added: ""There is a very human level to this and she is a public servant and you have every sympathy for her because she is a nice individual and no doubt dedicated and hard working but clearly things have gone badly wrong. ""Whether if she'd had a strong education background, whether that would have made a difference, who knows? ""Unfortunately there have been a lot of fingers in this awful algorithm pie."" Mr Williamson said: ""Following Sally Collier's decision to step down as Ofqual's Chief Regulator, I'd like to thank her for the commitment she has shown to the role over the last four years and wish her well for the future. ""I welcome Ofqual's announcement that Dame Glenys Stacey is to assume a temporary leadership role as acting chief regulator and also the new internal governance arrangements put in place with Ofsted support. ""This will make sure Ofqual can fully focus on the important functions it must deliver as the independent regulator for qualifications, examinations and assessments in England."" Head of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said: ""The future remains uncertain in the light of the current pandemic. The current plans are to prepare for a full exam series next summer - best case scenario. ""But the real risk that there will be further disruptions next academic year must be recognised and contingency plans for a range of possibilities need to be put in place. ""Students should not have to endure the uncertainty and chaos experienced this year.""

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The lawyers for the family of a black man shot in the back by police in the US state of Wisconsin say he will need a ""miracle"" to walk again. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times opening the door of his car in Kenosha. At least one of the bullets went through his spinal cord, lawyers said. Several people were reportedly shot on Tuesday night amid continuing unrest following the police shooting. The governor of Wisconsin is sending more National Guard troops to Kenosha. As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". This video can not be played Jacob Blake's mother: ""Letâs use our hearts, love and intelligence to work together"" Buildings and cars have been left damaged following protests over the shooting in the city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. On Tuesday, Governor Tony Evers said he would send more National Guard troops to Kenosha to protect state buildings and support first responders and firefighters. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin, as protesters clashed with police for a third night. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident show Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Buildings have been burnt down during protests in Kenosha Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters. This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to aid local police and imposed a night-time curfew on Kenosha. But some ignored the curfew, and police used tear gas to try to force protesters - some of whom were throwing water bottles - to disperse. Police, backed up by the National Guard, also used rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, news agency Reuters reported, while others set cars alight. Hundreds of protesters also marched through the city on Tuesday. A small group of demonstrators threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. There are also reports of armed men on the streets vowing to defend private property amid the unrest. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and Minneapolis, Minnesota. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting?

He added: ""This weather in August doesn't reassure us when our area is prone to flooding in winter, so the fact that we're dealing with this now shows that climate change should be taken seriously."" Heavy downpours have also caused disruption across Northern Ireland, where motorists were urged to seek alternative routes afterthe Shimna River burst its banksin County Down. Bridges were destroyed by flooding from the Shimna River in County Down There were also road closures elsewhere in the UK and some trains were cancelled or delayed due to flooding. Network Rail saidspeed restrictions were in place,externalon several rail routes across the UK. Avanti West Coast, Northern, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales are currently disrupted due to weather related issues, it said. On Tuesday, Network Rail acknowledged that it needs to better understand the risks of extreme weather following the train that derailed in Aberdeenshire earlier this month, killing three people. The public company, which manages the UK's railways, has asked world-renowned meteorologist Dame Julia Slingo to lead a task force which will aim to improve the company's forecasting of extreme weather and its impact on rail infrastructure. The company has also tasked Lord Robert Mair, a leading engineer, to spearhead a separate task force which will look at how Network Rail can improve its management of earthworks - for example embankments or when part of the land is excavated to make space for the railway. Meanwhile, the M48 Severn Bridge is closed in both directions between junctions one and two due to strong winds in the area, Highways England said. A DFDS ferry arrives in bad weather at the Port of Dover in Kent Three Met Office yellow weather warnings for rain and wind cover most of the UK on Tuesday, with stormy conditions expected to last until 06:00 BST on Wednesday. Rain warnings cover Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, northern England and parts of north Wales until Wednesday morning. Flood alerts, telling people to be prepared, have been issued for parts of the west Midlands and north west of England. Windsurfers were out at Westward Ho! in Devon, despite warnings of 70mph winds Storm Francis comes on the back of Ellen which struck last week and caused power outages. It marks the first time the Met Office has had two named storms in August since it started the process in 2015. Forecasters said the winds were ""unusual"" for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of 87mph recorded at The Needles in August 1996. Likewise, the wettest August on record in the UK was in 1912 when 167.3mm was recorded across the country as a whole. Between 1 and 22 August, the UK as a whole had seen some 72.7mm of rainfall - around four-fifths of the average rainfall for the month. No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next storm will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on 1 September. Have you been affected by Storm Francis?

"Lionel Messi has scored 70 goals in 138 games for Argentina Legendary Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has asked to leave this summer. The Argentina international, 33, sent a fax to the club on Tuesday saying he wishes to exercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. Barca werebeaten 8-2 by Bayern Munichin the Champions League quarter-finals on 16 August. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner made his debut for Barca in 2004 and has won the Champions League four times. Barcelona, though, believe the clause has now expired and Messi is contracted to the club until 2021 with a 700m euro buy-out clause. The board will meet soon and some consider the only thing that could placate Messi is the resignation of the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and early elections. But Messi seems determined to leave the club no matter what. Where could Messi go next? 'Has he thought of trying out baseball?' - Messi prompts social media meltdown Did Messi really send Barcelona a fax? After the news broke, Barca fans gathered outside the Nou Camp to protest against the board and in support of the club's record goalscorer. A legal battle is now set to follow between the club and the player. Messi had a clause in his contract which allowed him to leave for free, if he informed the club of his desire before 10 June. That date has now passed so Barca believe the clause has expired, but Messi and his team feel it should be extended to cover the prolonged season - which ran until August due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Respect and admiration, Leo. All my support, friend,"" Messi's former team-mate Carles Puyol tweeted, to which current team-mate Luis Suarez replied with two clapping emojis. Messi's future on list for Koeman at Barca - Balague column This video can not be played Lionel Messi's top five World Cup goals for Argentina Barcelona have said the clause ran out on 10 June and they are convinced, legally, they could win any challenge to it. Of course, the fact the season was prolonged gives Messi the right to think that he is able to apply that clause, but lawyers have told the club he will not win that dispute. The fax sent is a well-thought of step by Leo, who, having spoken to his family and lawyers, is desperate to leave the club. The way he thinks about it today is clear: this is not a battle for more power. He wants to leave. That is it. Even if nothing is agreed with another club right now, even if eventually Barcelona insist he has a 700m euro buy-out clause and will demand one of the biggest transfer fees in history despite having a year left on his contract, he doesn't care - he wants out. There are a lot of reasons why this has happened and I havewritten about it extensively.Things that have happened in the past few days seem to have made him go the extra mile, if you like. After a meeting with [new coach] Ronald Koeman, they had a private conversation, which neither Messi nor Koeman leaked to the press. I am convinced it was the intention of the club at the highest level to leak part of the story, especially the bit in which he was admitting to Koeman that he felt closer to leaving than staying. That extract would help turn the fans against Messi so they can eventually release him and use that money (his salary is over 50m euros net - double if taxes are counted) to renew the squad. If you believe he is the most important player, then you build a team around him, which is what Koeman wants to do. You don't start a campaign to get rid of him. Also the fact that Luis Suarez was told in a phone chat with Koeman that lasted two minutes that he was not wanted might have confirmed the impression Messi had that this board does things in a very disrespectful way. People say he has a lot of power in the club. He talks directly to the board if he gets asked, as all the top players do in big clubs. Let's see what he has recommended in recent times: the return of Neymar, which didn't happen; the continuation of [coach] Ernesto Valverde, which didn't happen; there was no need to sign Antoine Griezmann, which didn't happen - so I'm not sure he holds that much power. This is not just taking the toys out of the pram. It's a situation where he is not happy any more playing for this Barcelona that requires deep surgery to win the big trophies again. He wants to see the reaction of Barcelona next, but it is likely that he will not attend training. He might not do the pre-season medical tests. If that happens, the club will send a fax to Leo about not respecting his contract and the legal battle would start - and that can go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport eventually. Leo Messi wants to leave right now no matter what. But can he? As the contract says that the clause should have been activated by 10 June, the club is convinced they are in control. But do they want to keep a player that does not want to be there? Clubs like Paris St-Germain and Manchester City insist they have not made any move towards getting Messi. But clearly nobody knows the real financial implications of that move, so it is a logical reaction. Two other clubs have made lots of movements in the past to try to convince Messi to join them - Inter Milan and Chelsea. The only pressure possible against the board comes from social media - if that forces the resignation of Bartomeu, then we may enter a different phase. The impression we have is that the club will probably ask him to stay on but he might be forced to negotiate for a huge transfer fee. In the past, Manchester City came close to signing Messi (around 2016 when he felt persecuted by the Spanish government and tax men) and there were other moments when negotiations or at least conversations took place with other clubs (earlier on, even Real Madrid showed interest). But this time it seems there is nobody at the club with enough authority, charisma and, in some cases, honest interest in keeping him. So we will see if Barcelona really decide to ask for an impossible fee or who is willing to pay a transfer fee which, despite having one year left on his contract, Barcelona will demand to be close to Neymar's when he went to Paris St-Germain (222m euros). This saga will go on and on. Messi joined Barcelona aged 13 from Argentina's Newell's Old Boys in 2000, and has since scored a club record 634 goals in 731 appearances. He has won 34 major trophies with the club, including 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies. Here are some more records he holds: Most goals scored in La Liga (444) Most Ballons d'Or in history and most Fifa World Player of the Year/Best Fifa Men's Player Awards (6) Top goalscorer in all club competitions in a calendar year: 79 goals in 2012 Only player to score more than 40 goals in 10 consecutive seasons Most goals scored for a single club in the Champions League (115) This video can not be played Lionel Messi gets a fashion makeover from the woman who styled Jay-Z BBC Food:Calculate how to lose belly fat in four weeks Covid-19 Redundancy:A dream job lost to the pandemic Barcelona 'Everton need stability' - how chaotic day unfolded Lakers and Kings postpone games amid Los Angeles wildfires Ryan Giggs - what happened?

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" The Republican National Convention is nearing its conclusion, with Donald Trump set to close the event with a speech making the case for his re-election. What's been happening at the four-day event? Let's back up first. There's an obvious question... OK, good question. Party conventions take place once every four years - they are the ceremonial crowning of the party's presidential candidate as they prepare for the final phase of campaigning. Last time around, we saw the Trump family take centre stage to a backdrop of fireworks and a sea of red, white and blue balloons. This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" It's also where party officials wrap up other less glamorous business, like unveiling the political platform and adopting rules. This time - for the first time - no new platform is being adopted. The party will continue to support Mr Trump's 2016 manifesto. As the sitting president, Mr Trump is the de facto nominee but the convention has formally nominated him with a roll call, nonetheless. On Thursday, the president will formally accept the nomination with a big speech. The conventions of years past have been glitzy affairs, bringing together thousands of delegates, party leaders, activists and celebrities for receptions, speeches and general hyping up of the presidential candidate. But the pandemic has upended all that. Unlike its Democratic counterpart, the Republican Convention is hosting some in-person events at venues in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington DC, along with speeches delivered remotely. Each day will follow themes of America as the land of promise, opportunity, heroes and - in a nod to Trump's slogan - greatness. People are being told they need to wear masks and social distance. Those attending events are given a self-swab Covid-19 test before travelling and entering their hotels. Trump has been involved in some regard each day of the convention, either in person or in recorded videos. He will accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Does Don Jr say what his dad really thinks? This hasn't been entirely well received - with critics arguing using federal property for a campaign speech is unethical. In addition to President Trump, the following will be speaking on Thursday: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a senior White House adviser Alice Johnson, a criminal justice reform advocate whose life sentence was commuted by the president after a campaign led by Kim Kardashian The parents of Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who was taken hostage and killed in Syria Vice-President Pence addressed the convention remotely from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, where the city was defended against the British in the War of 1812, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Francis Scott Key saw the flag at the fort and wrote the words that later became the national anthem The former Indiana governor argued that Joe Biden would set the country on to ""a path of socialism and decline"". Pence warns Americans 'won't be safe' if Biden wins As pitchman for Mr Trump's re-election, he said voters need ""a president who believes in America"". This video can not be played Pence: Stakes in this election never higher On a night with the theme ""Land of Heroes"", his wife Karen Pence also addressed the convention, paying tribute to ""military spouses"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House next week, said of Mr Trump: ""He has stood by me, and he will stand up for you."" Kellyanne Conway said she had made the decision in order to focus on her children The 53-year-old announced this week that she was resigning from her postas senior adviser to Mr Trump at the end of August to focus on her children, giving them ""less drama, more mama"". Two black speakers on Wednesday spoke in support of President Trump. Clarence Henderson, a civil rights activist from the 1960s, spoke about the power of peaceful protest and the Republican Party's record on civil rights. Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and Fox News commentator, who is running for office in Utah, pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message. Several military veterans also addressed the convention as well as four of the party's rising female stars: Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, New York Representative Elise Stefanik, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump. US First LadyMelania Trump made a heartfelt plea for racial unitywhen she delivered a live speech from the White House on Tuesday. The day also saw two of the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump, making fierce attacks on the Democrats while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Israel, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, and critics called his participation unethical. Monday, the convention's opening day, was dominated bya speech by President Trump himself in which he warned Republicans their opponents might ""steal"" November's election. His claim that postal voting could lead to voter fraud has been dismissed by experts and election officials as a conspiracy theory. Trump's 2016 speech and 'the truth' From 2016: Trump promises a 'safer' America This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This is the greatest scam in the history of politics"" His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, described Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". The convention is expected to last 2.5 hours each night, Monday to Thursday, from 20:30 EST (00:30 GMT) to 23:00 EST (03:00 GMT). You can follow the latest news, including a live page on Thursday, atbbc.com/news. BBC World News and the BBC News Channel (available globally and in the UK, respectively) will broadcast Mr Trump's speech live and bring you reaction and analysis afterwards. And you can also watchon the Republican National Convention website.,external Few incumbent presidents of the modern era have faced a challenge as great as the one before Donald Trump in the final months of their re-election campaign. He has consistently trailed Joe Biden in the polls by a modest but significant margin for months. The Republican Convention is one of his last, best opportunities to turn the tide. The president's speech will be a good guide for how the Republicans hope to conduct their campaign over the final months. Will he focus on tearing down Joe Biden or on accomplishments from early in his presidency? Or will he try to convince the public that the worst days of the pandemic are over? The Democrats during their convention turned to voices from ""ordinary"" Americans - immigrants, workers and minorities - who said they had been harmed by the president's policies. The Republicans have countered with ones who will recount how they've been helped - or who are worried about what the Democrats would do in power. Have they made a compelling case? The rest of the week has been be filled with Republican officeholders of various levels. Some, including Vice-President Mike Pence, will be vying for position to lead the partyonce Trump leaves office - either next year or in 2024. Four years ago, Trump defied conventional practices and wisdom to win the presidency. He's remade the Republican Party in his image, with an emphasis on conservative populism and sometimes brash rhetoric. That new party, his party, has been on full display this week. Now we watch as campaigning heats up before the general election on 3 November. Be sure to set a reminder for the debates too, where we'll see Biden and Trump battle to win over voters. The first presidential debate is scheduled for 29 September with two more in October. Correction 21st June 2022: An earlier version of this article reported that Clarence Henderson had pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message and this has been amended to correctly characterise his remarks, which focused on peaceful process and the Republican Party's history.

"Virgin Atlantic has won backing from its creditors for a Â£1.2bn rescue plan that would secure its future for at least 18 months and save 6,500 jobs. The airline said shareholders, banks, aircraft owners and suppliers owed money had approved the plan. Virgin Atlantic said the agreement puts it in a position to ""rebuild its balance sheet"" and ""welcome passengers back"". It had warned it would run out of cash by September without the deal. The company will now need approval from the High Court in London, which it will seek on 2 September. The Â£1.2bn rescue deal involves Â£400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. American Airlines cuts 19,000 jobs amid travel slump Delta, the US-based airline which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, said it is ""optimistic that this plan will allow Virgin Atlantic to secure its future"", and said it remains ""firmly supportive"" of the company. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining jobs should be secure. The International Air Transport Association warned in June that the slump will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (Â£64bn) globally this year. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways-owner IAG who now runs his own aviation consultancy, told the BBC that under the deal, Virgin Atlantic's unsecured creditors would end up being paid 20% less than they were owed. Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Their repayments would also be rescheduled. Mr Boyle said the extra cash secured under the rescue deal did not ""seem like enough"", given that Sir Richard had asked the government for Â£500m and had his request rejected. In April, Virgin Australia - a separately run business - went into voluntary administration, making it Australia's first big corporate casualty of the coronavirus crisis. Sir Richard Branson's 10% shareholding was wiped out as a result. The following month it was bought by Bain Capital, which said it supported the airline's current management team and its turnaround plan for the business. Last month, Virgin Atlantic faced enforcement action over its delays in processing refunds for flights cancelled during the pandemic. It was the only airline threatened with action by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which has reviewed the refund waiting times of 18 major airlines. Virgin has been making consumers wait up to 120 days for a refund and the CAA said it was ""not satisfied"".

"Tests on samples showed the woman, 75, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February The earliest known person to contract coronavirus within the UK has been identified, scientists believe. Analysis of samples by the University of Nottingham showed a 75-year-old woman, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February. She is also understood to be first in the UK to die after contracting Covid-19. A Surrey resident waspreviously believedto have caught the virus first. News of the case has emerged only now, because samples were being analysed in retrospect by researchers as they investigated the origins of the UK pandemic. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Nearly 2,000 routine respiratory samples taken from patients at the Queen's Medical Centre, a Nottingham teaching hospital, between January and March were tested. The report, which has not yet been peer reviewed, states: ""Patient 1 in this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the earliest described community-acquired case of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, admitted to hospital care on the 21st of February 2020, and was also the first UK COVID-19 death, preceding the earliest known death by 2 days."" Until now, the first transmission of coronavirus within the UK was thought to have occurred on28 February.But this newresearch,externalsuggests there were home-grown cases earlier than this. Although the study comes from only one hospital in Nottingham, it signals that coronavirus was circulating undetected in Britain at least in early February 2020. The findings are perhaps not surprising, given the limited testing early on in the pandemic which meant only a small number of people were checked for the virus. Plenty of people have been doubting the official timeline of coronavirus spread. Otherresearch published in Mayrevealed France's first case was in December 2019 - almost a month earlier than previously thought. Studies like these help build a more complete picture of the history of the outbreak, but do not tell us what the virus will do next. Even if more people have been exposed to the virus than first appreciated, it's not clear whether this means more of us will be immune to the disease. The work also revealed that early coronavirus cases in the UK would have been identified if testing criteria had at the time been less strict, say the scientists. Prof Jonathan Ball, one of authors of the study, said there was ""widespread community transmission of coronavirus"" in Nottingham in early February. However, the researchers said the cases went undetected because testing for coronavirus required a strict criteria to be met like a recent travel history. The report also found a traveller who had returned from South Korea, who tested positive on the 28 February, had most likely caught the virus in Nottingham rather than in Korea, as had been assumed. Prof Ball said: ""Had the diagnostic criteria for Covid-19 been widened earlier to include patients with compatible symptoms but no travel history, it is likely that earlier imported infections would have been detected, which could have led to an earlier lockdown and lower deaths. ""However, the capacity for testing available nationally was not sufficient at the time to process the volume of testing required. ""In order to prepare for any future pandemic such as this, the UK urgently needs to invest in and expand diagnostic capacity within NHS and PHE diagnostic laboratory services."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""NHS Test and Trace is working, it's completely free and is stopping the spread of coronavirus. ""During this unprecedented pandemic we have rapidly built the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history, meaning anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get a test.""

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The lawyers for the family of a black man shot in the back by police in the US state of Wisconsin say he will need a ""miracle"" to walk again. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times opening the door of his car in Kenosha. At least one of the bullets went through his spinal cord, lawyers said. Several people were reportedly shot on Tuesday night amid continuing unrest following the police shooting. The governor of Wisconsin is sending more National Guard troops to Kenosha. As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". This video can not be played Jacob Blake's mother: ""Letâs use our hearts, love and intelligence to work together"" Buildings and cars have been left damaged following protests over the shooting in the city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. On Tuesday, Governor Tony Evers said he would send more National Guard troops to Kenosha to protect state buildings and support first responders and firefighters. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin, as protesters clashed with police for a third night. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident show Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Buildings have been burnt down during protests in Kenosha Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters. This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to aid local police and imposed a night-time curfew on Kenosha. But some ignored the curfew, and police used tear gas to try to force protesters - some of whom were throwing water bottles - to disperse. Police, backed up by the National Guard, also used rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, news agency Reuters reported, while others set cars alight. Hundreds of protesters also marched through the city on Tuesday. A small group of demonstrators threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. There are also reports of armed men on the streets vowing to defend private property amid the unrest. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and Minneapolis, Minnesota. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting?

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The black man shot many times in the back by Wisconsin police officers is paralysed from the waist down, his father has said. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times as he went to a car and opened its door in the city of Kenosha on Sunday. The shooting sparked two nights of protests in the city, with buildings and cars set alight. His father has now told a US newspaper that his son is paralysed - although doctors do not know if it is permanent. Jacob Blake Snr told the Chicago Sun Times his son had ""eight holes"",externalin his body. ""What justified all those shots?"" his father asked. ""What justified doing that in front of my grandsons? What are we doing?"" What do we know about the police shooting in Wisconsin? Video footage of Mr Blake's shooting, taken from across the street and shared on social media, shows the father-of-three leaning into the car and an officer grabbing his shirt, with seven shots heard. Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Monday, Governor Tony Evers called up the National Guard to aid local police, with a curfew imposed on the city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan from 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT) until 07:00 on Tuesday. This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin But some ignored the curfew, and police used tear gas to try to force protesters - some of whom were throwing water bottles - to disperse. Officers, who were backed up by the National Guard, also used rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, news agency Reuters reported, while others set cars alight. On Tuesday, Mr Evers said he would send more National Guard troops to Kenosha to protect state buildings and support first responders and firefighters. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland and Minneapolis. Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday. Police said they were responding to a domestic incident, but so far it is so unclear who called the police and how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Police in Kenosha do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"" when police drew their weapons. The person who shot the video, Raysean White, told CNN that before he began taking it, he saw police wrestle, punch and Taser Mr Blake. It was then he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident As Mr Blake opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, described how the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Speaking to a local NBC channel, she asked why the police would shoot someone ""who's not armed, not giving you no problems"". ""I've been yelling that the whole time, let me get my kids. So that's not important to y'all. What's important is killing somebody,"" she added. Police said that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Governor Evers, who is a Democrat, has said there will be a special session of the state legislature on 31 August to discuss a package of laws announced earlier this year on accountability and transparency of the police following the police killing of George Floyd. Lawmakers had ""failed to act"" in the two months since he announced the ""commonsense policies"", the governor tweeted. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday released a statement calling for a ""full and transparent investigation"" of the shooting. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society. Debates were triggered by the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. Mr Floyd's death sparked protests around the country, and abroad, and has ignited calls for police reform in the US. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting?

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the scheme is helping to protect nearly two million jobs Diners used the Eat Out to Help Out scheme more than 64 million times in its first three weeks, according to the latest Treasury figures. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It runs every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the scheme was supporting nearly two million jobs. ""Today's figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality - with more than 64 million meals discounted so far, that's equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs. ""This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out, and in doing so, how this is helping to protect the jobs of nearly two million people who work in hospitality."" According to restaurant booking website OpenTable, the number of customers at UK restaurants between Monday to Wednesday last week was 61% higher than last year. When does the 'eat out to help out scheme' end? Eat Out to Help Out cuts cost of school dinners The Treasury said 84,000 restaurants had now signed up to the scheme, which closes on 31 August. Eat Out to Help Out aims to help protect the jobs of 1.8 million employees in the hospitality industry by encouraging people to return to local eateries where social-distancing rules now apply. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. David Page, chairman of Fulham Shore, which owns Franco Manca and The Real Greek, said: ""Eat Out to Help Out immediately increased our restaurant customer numbers by over 50%, thus enabling us to get all our staff back to work. In fact, we are now creating new jobs ."" No vouchers are needed, with the participating establishment simply deducting 50% from the bill, up to the Â£10 per person maximum, and reclaiming the money from the Treasury. However, the discount is only on food and soft drinks eaten on the premises, and does not apply to takeaways. There is no limit on how many times the discount can be used in August, or for how many people, including children. However, the scheme has faced criticism. In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast it would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefits those well-off enough to eat out. Anti-obesity campaigners saidthe scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"". And some restaurant owners were concerned the measurescould pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade. Will the 'eat out to help out scheme' be extended?

"Ms Baguma is believed to have lost her job when her right to work expired The death of a woman whose one-year-old child was reportedly found malnourished beside her body is being investigated. Mercy Baguma, originally from Uganda, was discovered in a flat in Glasgow on Saturday 22 August after the sounds of her son crying were heard. A police spokesperson said her death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Refugee charity Positive Action in Housing said Ms Baguma had claimed asylum and lived in ""extreme poverty"". It said she lost her job after her right to work in the UK expired. Her son was found next to his mother, crying and ""weakened from several days of starvation"" according to Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing. The boy was taken to hospital and discharged on Monday 24 August, and is now staying with his father. The charity said Ms Baguma had contacted them several weeks ago saying she did not have enough money to look after herself or her child. Another charity, African Challenge Scotland, posted video on social media of Ms Baguma thanking its volunteers for delivering food in early June. Allow Twitter content?

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""This is a tragic situation and our condolences go to Ms Baguma's family."" They added: ""The Home Office takes the wellbeing of all those in the asylum system extremely seriously, and we will be conducting a full investigation into Ms Baguma's case."" Friends and relatives became concerned for their welfare when communication with Ms Baguma ceased on Tuesday 18 August. Ms Qureshi said: ""Why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, and why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces?"" She added: ""Would this mother be alive if she was not forced out of her job by this cruel system that stops you from working and paying your way because a piece of paper says your leave to remain has expired? I'm sure Mercy's son will want to ask this and other questions once he is old enough."" Positive Action in Housing said Ms Baguma's death was the latest tragedy to hit Glasgow's refugee community in less than four months. One man was shot dead after stabbing six people including a police officer atthe Park Inn hotel on Friday 26 June. At the start of May, a 30-year-old Syrian refugee, Adnan Walid Elbi, was founddead in his room in temporary hotel accommodation,externalin Glasgow. Glasgow City Council's convenor for equalities and human rights, Jen Layden, said: ""The tragic death of a young mum is devastating and my heart goes out to Mercy's family and friends - including her young son - at this sad time."" She added: ""We are currently trying to establish the full facts of Mercy's case and await additional information from the Home Office and Mears."" Positive Action in Housing has repeated calls for anindependent inquiry into asylum seeker accommodationduring the coronavirus pandemic. Clarification added on 29 August 2020: The charity Positive Action In Housing later clarified its description of the condition of Mercy's baby, saying: The reference to Mercy's baby ""starving"" was in relation to the window of time from August 18 to 22 when nobody had heard from her.

"Nearly 50,000 salmon escaped when a fish farm in Argyll broke free from its moorings, it has been revealed. The North Carradale farm, near Campbeltown,suffered damaged to four of its 10 fish pens during Storm Ellen. Owner Mowi said inspections by divers revealed the breakage of mooring ropes attached to the farm's seabed anchors was the cause. Just over 30,000 of the farmed salmon also died as a result of the incident. Mowi said it has sent the torn ropes to a testing facility in Aberdeen for further investigation. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said it ""shares concerns"" regarding the loss of salmon. She added: ""Whilst we are confident that marine pens have been returned to their authorised position and there was no significant pollution, we are liaising with Mowi and Marine Scotland, who have responsibility for fish escapes and their reporting."" The North Carradale farm contained 550,700 salmon before the four pens were damaged in bad weather on 20 August. Mowi said a total of 48,834 salmon escaped, 30,616 died and a further 125,000 were harvested. Environmental campaigners have raised concerns about the escaped fish breeding with wild Scottish salmon.

"This video can not be played Brits should end ""this general bout of self-recrimination and wetnessâ says the PM Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is opposed to the BBC's decision to play instrumental versions of Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! at the Last Night of the Proms next month. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history,"" he told reporters. Media reports have suggested the lyrics are being dropped due to associations with colonialism and slavery. But the BBC says the decision was prompted by Covid-19 restrictions. Fewer performers will be allowed on stage, which makes it harder to perform the songs with a traditional chorus. A BBC spokesperson said: ""For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year.  We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be different but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditional return next year."" Earlier, the BBC's director general Tony Hall said he felt the move to include instrumental versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory for this year's performance was the right one. ""I think they have come to the right conclusion,"" he told the BBC's media editor, Amol Rajan. ""It's very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over 5,000 people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night of the Proms and to have things where the whole audience normally sing along - it's quite hard creatively, artistically to make that work."" This video can not be played Tony Hall: ""I think they have come to the right conclusion which is actually to include it instrumentally"" He added: ""We have come to the right conclusion which is a creative conclusion, an artistic conclusion... it is there in a medley of instrumentals playing around sea shanties and all of that and I suspect it will be back next year."" The concert is due to take place on 12 September, without an audience and with limited performers at the Royal Albert Hall, due to concerns around Covid-19. Responding to the news of this year's changes, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I cannot believe... that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land Of Hope And Glory or Rule Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness. ""I wanted to get that off my chest,"" he added. A Labour Party spokesperson responded: ""The pomp and pageantry of the Last Night of the Proms is a staple of British summer. ""The running order is a matter for the organisers and the BBC, but enjoying patriotic songs does not - and should not - present a barrier to examining our past and learning lessons from it."" In a statement on Monday evening, BBC Proms said it was announcing the concert's programme following recent speculation. The whole debate was initially sparked by an article in The Sunday Times, whichsuggested the songs could be droppedcompletely in the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter protests. The newspaper claimed there were concerns by key members of the orchestra about their associations with the British Empire, colonialism and slavery. Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, Britannia Could the BBC Proms drop Rule, Britannia? Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules The Proms said there would be new orchestral versions of Land Of Hope And Glory, and Rule, Britannia!, as well as a new arrangement of Jerusalem, which will be sung. ""With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time, including You'll Never Walk Alone, presenting a poignant and inclusive event for 2020,"" the statement said. Ivor Novello-winning composer Errollyn Wallen confirmed online on Monday evening that she is making the new arrangement of Proms favourite, Jerusalem, ""In it I remember the Commonwealth nations and am dedicating the work to the Windrush generation,""tweeted,externalthe Belize-born British musician. Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, told Times Radio he felt the BBC ""is always in a panic about race, and one of the reasons it is always in a panic is that it has no confidence"". ""The principal reason it has no confidence... is that there is no ethnic diversity at the top of its decision-making tree. ""What you have is rooms full of white men panicking that someone is going to think they are racist."" Broadcaster and choirmaster Gareth Malone has suggested the anthems are outdated, tweeting: ""It's time for Rule Britannia! to go."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the 2020 move was ""all very sad"", adding: ""There's some lovely words to Rule Britannia."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he called for a ""compromise"" of a single voice performing the tune, rather than the usual sing-along version. ""Let's just have a single voice singing those words proudly,"" he said. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of tradition, and it's a beautiful tune."" Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. She told the BBC: ""We find it offensive.

"Face coverings will only be required in corridors, communal areas and on buses Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday. Education Secretary John Swinney said the new rules would apply to all pupils aged over 12. He saidthe guidance,externalhad been updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization(WHO). There will be no requirement to wear face coverings in classrooms where distancing measures are in place. Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? WHO says children over 12 should wear masks Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? Mr Swinney said individual exemptions could be granted for health reasons, but the guidance would be ""obligatory"" for all secondary, special and grant-aided schools. He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""From August 31st young people over the age of 12 in secondary schools should habitually be wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal areas where it is difficult to deliver the physical distancing."" He said the Scottish government had acted in the light of the new WHO advice based on evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults, but had decided to go further by extending it to school transport. ""It's part of the general measures we are taking to ensure we keep pace with the emerging advice about how to keep our schools open and to keep our schools safe,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signalled on Monday that a change in the guidance was imminent. The new rules for school buses will apply to pupils over the age of five, in line with guidelines for public transport. Staff and students can continue to wear face coverings in all settings voluntarily if they wish. Eileen Prior, executive director of the parents' organisation Connect, formerly known as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, earlier said she hoped schools would be offered some flexibility over how the new guidance was implemented. She said: ""In some schools it won't be necessary - it depends very much on the environment within a school. ""Some schools are incredibly crowded but some simply aren't and some are well below capacity, perhaps with wide corridors and they don't have the issue that we have in many high schools of young people just crowding because they just can't not crowd."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âIf we need to change the advice then of course we willâ But Mr Swinney said while the new rules were not mandatory, they had the same status as other guidance on reopening of schools, such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, and should be considered ""obligatory"" across the secondary sector. ""There will be exemptions from this because the wearing of face coverings is not suitable for all individuals and that has to be respected,"" he said. He also stressed that an individual pupil should not be excluded from a school because they were not wearing a face covering. The UK government has said there are ""no plans"" to introduce similar measures when schools return in England after the summer break. Head teachers, however,have complained about a lack of clarityand asked whether English schools would have the flexibility to allow masks if requested as a safety measure by teachers. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the revised guidance in Scotland was a sensible move. She said: ""The schools have done brilliantly well getting going again but I think their physical distancing in some of the communal areas is always going to be a bit of a challenge to enforce... when we've still got cases circulating in the community this will provide additional protection when it's difficult to physically distance."" She said there may be more work to do to educate young people about the correct way to put on or remove a face covering. ""Not touching the surface - taking it off around the ears. I would recommend young people might carry a little bag in their pocket, stick the face covering in there and when they're taking it off and when they're putting it back on, making sure they don't touch the front of it,"" she said. ""And then of course there's the cleaning issue - these coverings need to be washed, just in warm water and soap."" The interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the education advisory group had considered carefully whether poor hygiene while using masks might spread the virus. ""In their consideration they looked at the evidence from infection from removing masks, on and off, and whether that was likely to play a significant component in terms of introducing an increased risk of transmission,"" he said. ""On balance, their assessment of that evidence was that there was insufficient evidence to support that view."" The EIS teaching union welcomed the announcement as a ""sensible and appropriate step"" but repeated its call for investment in more teaching staff to allow smaller class sizes. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""There needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Lionel Messi has scored 70 goals in 138 games for Argentina Legendary Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has asked to leave this summer. The Argentina international, 33, sent a fax to the club on Tuesday saying he wishes to exercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. Barca werebeaten 8-2 by Bayern Munichin the Champions League quarter-finals on 16 August. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner made his debut for Barca in 2004 and has won the Champions League four times. Barcelona, though, believe the clause has now expired and Messi is contracted to the club until 2021 with a 700m euro buy-out clause. The board will meet soon and some consider the only thing that could placate Messi is the resignation of the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and early elections. But Messi seems determined to leave the club no matter what. Where could Messi go next? 'Has he thought of trying out baseball?' - Messi prompts social media meltdown Did Messi really send Barcelona a fax? After the news broke, Barca fans gathered outside the Nou Camp to protest against the board and in support of the club's record goalscorer. A legal battle is now set to follow between the club and the player. Messi had a clause in his contract which allowed him to leave for free, if he informed the club of his desire before 10 June. That date has now passed so Barca believe the clause has expired, but Messi and his team feel it should be extended to cover the prolonged season - which ran until August due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Respect and admiration, Leo. All my support, friend,"" Messi's former team-mate Carles Puyol tweeted, to which current team-mate Luis Suarez replied with two clapping emojis. Messi's future on list for Koeman at Barca - Balague column This video can not be played Lionel Messi's top five World Cup goals for Argentina Barcelona have said the clause ran out on 10 June and they are convinced, legally, they could win any challenge to it. Of course, the fact the season was prolonged gives Messi the right to think that he is able to apply that clause, but lawyers have told the club he will not win that dispute. The fax sent is a well-thought of step by Leo, who, having spoken to his family and lawyers, is desperate to leave the club. The way he thinks about it today is clear: this is not a battle for more power. He wants to leave. That is it. Even if nothing is agreed with another club right now, even if eventually Barcelona insist he has a 700m euro buy-out clause and will demand one of the biggest transfer fees in history despite having a year left on his contract, he doesn't care - he wants out. There are a lot of reasons why this has happened and I havewritten about it extensively.Things that have happened in the past few days seem to have made him go the extra mile, if you like. After a meeting with [new coach] Ronald Koeman, they had a private conversation, which neither Messi nor Koeman leaked to the press. I am convinced it was the intention of the club at the highest level to leak part of the story, especially the bit in which he was admitting to Koeman that he felt closer to leaving than staying. That extract would help turn the fans against Messi so they can eventually release him and use that money (his salary is over 50m euros net - double if taxes are counted) to renew the squad. If you believe he is the most important player, then you build a team around him, which is what Koeman wants to do. You don't start a campaign to get rid of him. Also the fact that Luis Suarez was told in a phone chat with Koeman that lasted two minutes that he was not wanted might have confirmed the impression Messi had that this board does things in a very disrespectful way. People say he has a lot of power in the club. He talks directly to the board if he gets asked, as all the top players do in big clubs. Let's see what he has recommended in recent times: the return of Neymar, which didn't happen; the continuation of [coach] Ernesto Valverde, which didn't happen; there was no need to sign Antoine Griezmann, which didn't happen - so I'm not sure he holds that much power. This is not just taking the toys out of the pram. It's a situation where he is not happy any more playing for this Barcelona that requires deep surgery to win the big trophies again. He wants to see the reaction of Barcelona next, but it is likely that he will not attend training. He might not do the pre-season medical tests. If that happens, the club will send a fax to Leo about not respecting his contract and the legal battle would start - and that can go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport eventually. Leo Messi wants to leave right now no matter what. But can he? As the contract says that the clause should have been activated by 10 June, the club is convinced they are in control. But do they want to keep a player that does not want to be there? Clubs like Paris St-Germain and Manchester City insist they have not made any move towards getting Messi. But clearly nobody knows the real financial implications of that move, so it is a logical reaction. Two other clubs have made lots of movements in the past to try to convince Messi to join them - Inter Milan and Chelsea. The only pressure possible against the board comes from social media - if that forces the resignation of Bartomeu, then we may enter a different phase. The impression we have is that the club will probably ask him to stay on but he might be forced to negotiate for a huge transfer fee. In the past, Manchester City came close to signing Messi (around 2016 when he felt persecuted by the Spanish government and tax men) and there were other moments when negotiations or at least conversations took place with other clubs (earlier on, even Real Madrid showed interest). But this time it seems there is nobody at the club with enough authority, charisma and, in some cases, honest interest in keeping him. So we will see if Barcelona really decide to ask for an impossible fee or who is willing to pay a transfer fee which, despite having one year left on his contract, Barcelona will demand to be close to Neymar's when he went to Paris St-Germain (222m euros). This saga will go on and on. Messi joined Barcelona aged 13 from Argentina's Newell's Old Boys in 2000, and has since scored a club record 634 goals in 731 appearances. He has won 34 major trophies with the club, including 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies. Here are some more records he holds: Most goals scored in La Liga (444) Most Ballons d'Or in history and most Fifa World Player of the Year/Best Fifa Men's Player Awards (6) Top goalscorer in all club competitions in a calendar year: 79 goals in 2012 Only player to score more than 40 goals in 10 consecutive seasons Most goals scored for a single club in the Champions League (115) This video can not be played Lionel Messi gets a fashion makeover from the woman who styled Jay-Z BBC Food:Calculate how to lose belly fat in four weeks Covid-19 Redundancy:A dream job lost to the pandemic Barcelona 'Everton need stability' - how chaotic day unfolded Lakers and Kings postpone games amid Los Angeles wildfires Ryan Giggs - what happened?

"Nearly 50,000 salmon escaped when a fish farm in Argyll broke free from its moorings, it has been revealed. The North Carradale farm, near Campbeltown,suffered damaged to four of its 10 fish pens during Storm Ellen. Owner Mowi said inspections by divers revealed the breakage of mooring ropes attached to the farm's seabed anchors was the cause. Just over 30,000 of the farmed salmon also died as a result of the incident. Mowi said it has sent the torn ropes to a testing facility in Aberdeen for further investigation. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said it ""shares concerns"" regarding the loss of salmon. She added: ""Whilst we are confident that marine pens have been returned to their authorised position and there was no significant pollution, we are liaising with Mowi and Marine Scotland, who have responsibility for fish escapes and their reporting."" The North Carradale farm contained 550,700 salmon before the four pens were damaged in bad weather on 20 August. Mowi said a total of 48,834 salmon escaped, 30,616 died and a further 125,000 were harvested. Environmental campaigners have raised concerns about the escaped fish breeding with wild Scottish salmon.

"Secondary schools in England might be using face masks after a change of policy Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors in local lockdown areas of England, after the government reversed its guidance. Head teachers in any secondary school will also have the ""flexibility"" to introduce masks in their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it followed updated advice from the World Health Organization. But Labour accused the government of ""passing the buck"" on decisions back to schools. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new guidance meant that in coronavirus ""hot spot"" areas that ""it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face covering in the corridor and elsewhere"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says face coverings should be worn ""outside the classroom"" in secondary schools in hotspot areas The change in rules, announced on Tuesday night, will not mean face coverings in the classroom - which Mr Johnson said would have been ""nonsensical"" as ""you can't teach with face coverings and you can't expect people to learn with face coverings."" Mr Johnson, at a school in Leicestershire, told pupils their exam grades were ""almost derailed by a mutant algorithm"" and the biggest risk to them was not Covid-19, but ""continuing to be out of school"". His comments came just before the government announced a change in the leadership at the top of the Department for Education. The most senior civil servant in the department, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, has been asked to stand down. A statement said the prime minister had concluded there was ""a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education"". It added: ""Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September in advance of the end of his tenure in Spring 2021."" The policy switch on face coverings, so near to the return to school, had drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman said the use of face coverings sent ""the wrong message"" which suggested ""schools are not a safe setting"". Late U-turn on face masks frustrates teachers PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? Ditch truancy fines, say doctors as pupils return Mr Williamson insisted the government was listening ""to the latest medical and scientific advice"" and taking ""the most precautionary approach"". The Department for Education says it is still keeping its recommendation against using face coverings - but that secondary schools will now be able to make their own decisions whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them. This will be in ""communal areas"" of schools such as corridors, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and when schools ""believe that is right in their particular circumstances"". But in parts of the country with high levels of coronavirus transmission, such asthose with local lockdown,externalmeasures, face coverings will be compulsory in such communal areas for adults and pupils. The return to school in Germany - but the PM says masks would be ""nonsensical"" in classrooms and would disrupt learning The new guidelines, which apply from 1 September, also warn that ""stricter guidance"" on face coverings could apply to all schools ""if the rate of transmission increases across the whole country"". On Wednesday the Department for Education said all schools would be supplied with 10 coronavirus testing kits, to be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" when no other way of testing is available. They would also be given a ""small amount"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as aprons, gloves, visors and clinical face masks. The change on face coverings follows the WHO updating its advice last week, which now recommends thatchildren aged over 12 should wear masksunder the same conditions as adults. The government had been under pressure over face coverings in England's schools - with secondary schools in Scotland to use them in corridors and communal areas from next week. Northern Ireland isalso now recommending face coveringsfor secondary school corridors, while Wales has left the decision up to head teachers, but highlights advice which recommends them inside where social distancing cannot be maintained, including on school transport. The ASCL head teachers' union had warned of confusion about the rules over face coverings - and said there was a lack of clarity over how schools should respond if teachers or pupils wanted to wear masks. This video can not be played Tulip Siddiq says the government must give âclearer guidanceâ on students wearing face masks in English schools After the government's change of policy, the union's leader, Geoff Barton, said school leaders would ""welcome the flexibility"" of being able to ""decide what best suits their circumstances"". But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It is neither helpful or fair to ask school leaders to make individual decisions about face coverings in their school. Such decisions should rest with public health officials."" Kevin Courtney, of the National Education Union, welcomed ""the steps now being taken"" but criticised the ""slow, incoherent"" way the decision had been reached - and said it would not inspire confidence with parents or teachers. Conservative MP Huw Merriman said the change in guidance was ""causing uncertainty"". ""My concern is that we just keep making this up as we go along,"" the Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government ""needs to get a grip"". Asked whether he took responsibility for the decisions made on face coverings and exam grades, Mr Williamson admitted it had been ""incredibly difficult and incredibly tough"". ""At every stage, everyone takes responsibility for what they do and how they approach things and what we're focused on is making sure we deliver the best for children right across the country,"" he told BBC Breakfast. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Some parents said they wanted to see face coverings mandatory in communal areas of all secondary schools. Pamela Allen, from Canterbury, said her son's secondary school had told her it would be following government guidance and would not require face coverings to be worn. ""I think [the government] should be leading the charge against the virus as opposed to reacting to it if there is a local lockdown,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make us feel confident that we are sending our children to as safe a place as we can."" She added she would be sending her son to school with a face covering to wear between lessons. A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school Despite the official guidance against face coverings, some schools had already been preparing to use them. The Oasis academy trust, with more than 50 schools in England, is to provide visors for its teachers - and secondary pupils were going to have to wear masks in corridors. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the trust, said there was a responsibility to make schools ""as safe as we possibly can"" - and that meant using masks and visors. He said that masks might increase the confidence of parents ""nervous"" about sending their children back to school. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas of schools. ""Instead of this half baked U-turn, the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it,"" she said.

"Face coverings will only be required in corridors, communal areas and on buses Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday. Education Secretary John Swinney said the new rules would apply to all pupils aged over 12. He saidthe guidance,externalhad been updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization(WHO). There will be no requirement to wear face coverings in classrooms where distancing measures are in place. Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? WHO says children over 12 should wear masks Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? Mr Swinney said individual exemptions could be granted for health reasons, but the guidance would be ""obligatory"" for all secondary, special and grant-aided schools. He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""From August 31st young people over the age of 12 in secondary schools should habitually be wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal areas where it is difficult to deliver the physical distancing."" He said the Scottish government had acted in the light of the new WHO advice based on evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults, but had decided to go further by extending it to school transport. ""It's part of the general measures we are taking to ensure we keep pace with the emerging advice about how to keep our schools open and to keep our schools safe,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signalled on Monday that a change in the guidance was imminent. The new rules for school buses will apply to pupils over the age of five, in line with guidelines for public transport. Staff and students can continue to wear face coverings in all settings voluntarily if they wish. Eileen Prior, executive director of the parents' organisation Connect, formerly known as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, earlier said she hoped schools would be offered some flexibility over how the new guidance was implemented. She said: ""In some schools it won't be necessary - it depends very much on the environment within a school. ""Some schools are incredibly crowded but some simply aren't and some are well below capacity, perhaps with wide corridors and they don't have the issue that we have in many high schools of young people just crowding because they just can't not crowd."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âIf we need to change the advice then of course we willâ But Mr Swinney said while the new rules were not mandatory, they had the same status as other guidance on reopening of schools, such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, and should be considered ""obligatory"" across the secondary sector. ""There will be exemptions from this because the wearing of face coverings is not suitable for all individuals and that has to be respected,"" he said. He also stressed that an individual pupil should not be excluded from a school because they were not wearing a face covering. The UK government has said there are ""no plans"" to introduce similar measures when schools return in England after the summer break. Head teachers, however,have complained about a lack of clarityand asked whether English schools would have the flexibility to allow masks if requested as a safety measure by teachers. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the revised guidance in Scotland was a sensible move. She said: ""The schools have done brilliantly well getting going again but I think their physical distancing in some of the communal areas is always going to be a bit of a challenge to enforce... when we've still got cases circulating in the community this will provide additional protection when it's difficult to physically distance."" She said there may be more work to do to educate young people about the correct way to put on or remove a face covering. ""Not touching the surface - taking it off around the ears. I would recommend young people might carry a little bag in their pocket, stick the face covering in there and when they're taking it off and when they're putting it back on, making sure they don't touch the front of it,"" she said. ""And then of course there's the cleaning issue - these coverings need to be washed, just in warm water and soap."" The interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the education advisory group had considered carefully whether poor hygiene while using masks might spread the virus. ""In their consideration they looked at the evidence from infection from removing masks, on and off, and whether that was likely to play a significant component in terms of introducing an increased risk of transmission,"" he said. ""On balance, their assessment of that evidence was that there was insufficient evidence to support that view."" The EIS teaching union welcomed the announcement as a ""sensible and appropriate step"" but repeated its call for investment in more teaching staff to allow smaller class sizes. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""There needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Rules around face coverings are easing across the UK, but they are still required in some settings. Heathrow Airport and a number of airlines are relaxing their rules on masks. But Nicola Sturgeon has said face coverings must still be worn in Scotland after all other legal requirements are lifted on 21 March. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings will remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services will move from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks will be reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens.

"Pupils in Germany wearing face masks. But heads want clarification on wearing them in schools in England Head teachers have complained about a lack of clarity over the rules on whether teachers or pupils can wear face masks in schools in England. They want to know if they can override the official guidance which rejects the use of face coverings in school. ""The guidance is silent on what schools should do if staff or pupils want to wear face coverings,"" says Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union. A Downing Street spokesman ruled out any review on masks in school. InScotland's secondary schools, face coverings will be used in corridors and shared areas. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. But Mr Barton said it remained unclear whether schools in England could have flexibility to allow masks if they were requested as a safety measure by teachers or pupils' parents or where they might be seen as a ""useful additional measure"". A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school It comes as head teachers in England have written a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson,seen by the Guardian,,externalaccusing the government of failing to listen during the coronavirus crisis. The Worth Less? lobbying group, which says it represents thousands of head teachers, wrote that they felt they were ""working in isolation"" from the government as they faced ""some of the most important challenges of our professional lives"". ""Collaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by head teachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes,"" it said. Face masks for corridors in Scotland's secondary schools PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Medical adviser calls for return to school Jon Richards of Unison, representing support staff in schools, said masks were worn in other workplaces and it was ""vital"" that school staff should be allowed to wear them. Medical advisers at the weekend also highlightedthe risk of teachers spreading the virus to each other- rather than from pupil to pupil. The government's guidance, issued in early July, says Public Health Englanddoes not recommend using face coverings,externalin school. Schools are getting ready for reopening in September As pupils would be in their own separate ""bubbles"" there is no need for masks, says the guidance, which warned that ""misuse"" of face coverings could ""inadvertently increase the risk of transmission"". On Monday, a Downing Street spokesman said masks could get in the way of communication between teachers and pupils. Since the government guidance was published on returning safely to school on 2 July, the use of masks has become more widespread, for example, becoming compulsory in shops. ASCL said they had asked for further guidance on wearing masks more than a month ago. ""It would be helpful if the government could provide more advice on these complex issues but that has not been forthcoming,"" said Mr Barton. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have consistently followed Public Health England advice, which does not recommend the use of face coverings in schools because there are a range of protective measures in place, including children staying in consistent groups. ""We have set out the system of controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children in the coming weeks.""

"Elton John and Renate Blauel were married in 1984 and divorced four years later Sir Elton John's ex-wife, Renate Blauel, tried to take her own life during the couple's honeymoon in 1984, according to legal papers filed at the High Court in London. Ms Blauel said she took an overdose of Valium after the star told her ""the marriage was not working and that he wanted her to leave"" three days into their stay in St Tropez. The claims emerged as part of Ms Blauel's Â£3m damages claim against Sir Elton, over allegations he broke the terms of their divorce deal. The German-born sound engineer was married to Sir Elton for four years, and has kept a low profile since the end of the marriage in 1988. But she filed legal papers earlier this year, after taking exception to the depiction of their relationship in Sir Elton's 2019 autobiography Me, as well as in the hit movie Rocketman. Elton John's ex-wife demands Â£3m over memoir The disclosures triggered longstanding mental health problems, her claim said. In response, Sir Elton's defence acknowledged the existence of the divorce agreement, which both parties signed, but denied any breaches or causing ""psychological harm"". However, Ms Blauel's lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said the star had prior knowledge of Ms Blauel's struggles with ""depression and anxiety"", and that the condition was ""exacerbated by press interest in her and by publicity relating to her"". He cited her suicide attempt and a series of panic attacks during their marriage as proof. One such incident came during a lunch the star and his wife hosted for members of the Royal family ""in or about 1985"". ""During this visit, Princess Margaret asked the claimant about a painting belonging to the defendant,"" said the court papers. ""The claimant was unable to recall any details about the painting and this caused her to panic and become very anxious. ""She interrupted the defendant's conversation with the Queen Mother to ask for assistance before removing herself to another room. ""Although she did not explain to the defendant why she had done this, it must have been obvious to him that she had absented herself because of her anxiety."" In previous court papers, Ms Blauel said Sir Elton's memoir and the Rocketman biopic had prompted renewed interest in her marriage, with one journalist ""trying to locate her in her local village"", causing her ""great anxiety"". According to her latest filing, she has subsequently spent thousands of pounds on therapy and treatment. In response to the new court documents, Sir Elton's legal counsel Jenny Afia said: ""Elton has always respected Renate's privacy and will continue to do so. ""It is well documented that their marriage was completely respectful and the relationship both Elton and Renate had after they divorced continued to be kind, respectful and honourable for the 30 years following."" She added that she found it ""baffling"" that Ms Blauel's case ""centred around privacy when at every stage of these proceedings Renate has chosen to file these claims in the public domain"". ""This only goes to show the true purpose of this claim which is to extract a large sum of money from Elton and tarnish his name publicly with falsehoods."" Reacting to the statement issued by Sir Elton's lawyers, Ms Blauel's legal counsel accused the star of ""seeking to belittle and discredit"" his client, adding that the case ""has never been about money"". ""The recent disclosure of very personal details about our client has only come to light because Sir Elton's team demanded the information,"" added Yisrael Hiller of Asserson. ""Renate remains hopeful that Sir Elton will accept that he has breached their agreement and undertake never to do so again so that Renate can live without fear of further invasion of her privacy.""

"Secondary schools in England might be using face masks after a change of policy Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors in local lockdown areas of England, after the government reversed its guidance. Head teachers in any secondary school will also have the ""flexibility"" to introduce masks in their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it followed updated advice from the World Health Organization. But Labour accused the government of ""passing the buck"" on decisions back to schools. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new guidance meant that in coronavirus ""hot spot"" areas that ""it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face covering in the corridor and elsewhere"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says face coverings should be worn ""outside the classroom"" in secondary schools in hotspot areas The change in rules, announced on Tuesday night, will not mean face coverings in the classroom - which Mr Johnson said would have been ""nonsensical"" as ""you can't teach with face coverings and you can't expect people to learn with face coverings."" Mr Johnson, at a school in Leicestershire, told pupils their exam grades were ""almost derailed by a mutant algorithm"" and the biggest risk to them was not Covid-19, but ""continuing to be out of school"". His comments came just before the government announced a change in the leadership at the top of the Department for Education. The most senior civil servant in the department, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, has been asked to stand down. A statement said the prime minister had concluded there was ""a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education"". It added: ""Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September in advance of the end of his tenure in Spring 2021."" The policy switch on face coverings, so near to the return to school, had drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman said the use of face coverings sent ""the wrong message"" which suggested ""schools are not a safe setting"". Late U-turn on face masks frustrates teachers PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? Ditch truancy fines, say doctors as pupils return Mr Williamson insisted the government was listening ""to the latest medical and scientific advice"" and taking ""the most precautionary approach"". The Department for Education says it is still keeping its recommendation against using face coverings - but that secondary schools will now be able to make their own decisions whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them. This will be in ""communal areas"" of schools such as corridors, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and when schools ""believe that is right in their particular circumstances"". But in parts of the country with high levels of coronavirus transmission, such asthose with local lockdown,externalmeasures, face coverings will be compulsory in such communal areas for adults and pupils. The return to school in Germany - but the PM says masks would be ""nonsensical"" in classrooms and would disrupt learning The new guidelines, which apply from 1 September, also warn that ""stricter guidance"" on face coverings could apply to all schools ""if the rate of transmission increases across the whole country"". On Wednesday the Department for Education said all schools would be supplied with 10 coronavirus testing kits, to be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" when no other way of testing is available. They would also be given a ""small amount"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as aprons, gloves, visors and clinical face masks. The change on face coverings follows the WHO updating its advice last week, which now recommends thatchildren aged over 12 should wear masksunder the same conditions as adults. The government had been under pressure over face coverings in England's schools - with secondary schools in Scotland to use them in corridors and communal areas from next week. Northern Ireland isalso now recommending face coveringsfor secondary school corridors, while Wales has left the decision up to head teachers, but highlights advice which recommends them inside where social distancing cannot be maintained, including on school transport. The ASCL head teachers' union had warned of confusion about the rules over face coverings - and said there was a lack of clarity over how schools should respond if teachers or pupils wanted to wear masks. This video can not be played Tulip Siddiq says the government must give âclearer guidanceâ on students wearing face masks in English schools After the government's change of policy, the union's leader, Geoff Barton, said school leaders would ""welcome the flexibility"" of being able to ""decide what best suits their circumstances"". But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It is neither helpful or fair to ask school leaders to make individual decisions about face coverings in their school. Such decisions should rest with public health officials."" Kevin Courtney, of the National Education Union, welcomed ""the steps now being taken"" but criticised the ""slow, incoherent"" way the decision had been reached - and said it would not inspire confidence with parents or teachers. Conservative MP Huw Merriman said the change in guidance was ""causing uncertainty"". ""My concern is that we just keep making this up as we go along,"" the Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government ""needs to get a grip"". Asked whether he took responsibility for the decisions made on face coverings and exam grades, Mr Williamson admitted it had been ""incredibly difficult and incredibly tough"". ""At every stage, everyone takes responsibility for what they do and how they approach things and what we're focused on is making sure we deliver the best for children right across the country,"" he told BBC Breakfast. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Some parents said they wanted to see face coverings mandatory in communal areas of all secondary schools. Pamela Allen, from Canterbury, said her son's secondary school had told her it would be following government guidance and would not require face coverings to be worn. ""I think [the government] should be leading the charge against the virus as opposed to reacting to it if there is a local lockdown,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make us feel confident that we are sending our children to as safe a place as we can."" She added she would be sending her son to school with a face covering to wear between lessons. A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school Despite the official guidance against face coverings, some schools had already been preparing to use them. The Oasis academy trust, with more than 50 schools in England, is to provide visors for its teachers - and secondary pupils were going to have to wear masks in corridors. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the trust, said there was a responsibility to make schools ""as safe as we possibly can"" - and that meant using masks and visors. He said that masks might increase the confidence of parents ""nervous"" about sending their children back to school. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas of schools. ""Instead of this half baked U-turn, the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it,"" she said.

"Virgin Atlantic has won backing from its creditors for a Â£1.2bn rescue plan that would secure its future for at least 18 months and save 6,500 jobs. The airline said shareholders, banks, aircraft owners and suppliers owed money had approved the plan. Virgin Atlantic said the agreement puts it in a position to ""rebuild its balance sheet"" and ""welcome passengers back"". It had warned it would run out of cash by September without the deal. The company will now need approval from the High Court in London, which it will seek on 2 September. The Â£1.2bn rescue deal involves Â£400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. American Airlines cuts 19,000 jobs amid travel slump Delta, the US-based airline which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, said it is ""optimistic that this plan will allow Virgin Atlantic to secure its future"", and said it remains ""firmly supportive"" of the company. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining jobs should be secure. The International Air Transport Association warned in June that the slump will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (Â£64bn) globally this year. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways-owner IAG who now runs his own aviation consultancy, told the BBC that under the deal, Virgin Atlantic's unsecured creditors would end up being paid 20% less than they were owed. Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Their repayments would also be rescheduled. Mr Boyle said the extra cash secured under the rescue deal did not ""seem like enough"", given that Sir Richard had asked the government for Â£500m and had his request rejected. In April, Virgin Australia - a separately run business - went into voluntary administration, making it Australia's first big corporate casualty of the coronavirus crisis. Sir Richard Branson's 10% shareholding was wiped out as a result. The following month it was bought by Bain Capital, which said it supported the airline's current management team and its turnaround plan for the business. Last month, Virgin Atlantic faced enforcement action over its delays in processing refunds for flights cancelled during the pandemic. It was the only airline threatened with action by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which has reviewed the refund waiting times of 18 major airlines. Virgin has been making consumers wait up to 120 days for a refund and the CAA said it was ""not satisfied"".

"Councillor Ian Ward, said people should continue to follow the relevant safety guidance A council will be given the power to close pubs and restaurants that do not follow Covid-19 rules. Birmingham City Council will be allowed to take enforcement action against businesses that fail to comply - in a bid to drive infection rates down. The city ison a government watch listafter a spike in cases, but latest figures show numbers are falling. The council's leader said it ""cannot be complacent"". Under the measures, which come into force on Wednesday, businesses who are failing to comply with Covid-19 regulations could be issued with a written warning and, if they continue to flout the rules, may be ordered to close. Latest figures show the number of cases in Birmingham has begun to fall The council will also be able to prohibit certain types of event taking place, including weddings, based on size. It will also be able to restrict access to, or close, public outdoor places if there is a public health need to do so. The council has a whistleblowing number for members of the public to use if they feel a business is not complying with regulations. Birmingham was put on Public Health England's watchlist on Friday. The number of cases in the city in the week to 13 August was 347, but dropped to 272 in the week to 20 August. However, this worked out at 24 cases per 100,000 residents in one week, compared with 11 per 100,000 across the whole of England. Since the second city went onto the 'watchlist' there has been plenty of speculation about what would come next. I understand the government was worried about a Leicester-style widespread set of spikes that would warrant more serious action. But the very latest figures show a halt in the upwards trend, plus more specific pockets of cases. So rather than more draconian measures, for the moment anyway, the council will simply enforce many of the current guidelines - but with the force of the law behind it. That means resources though. A new whistleblowing hotline will help. But it's a big job. Latest news from the West Midlands The city council's leader, Councillor Ian Ward, said:  ""While the recent figures show our rates are going down, we cannot be complacent.

A petition to save the shipyard got more than 10,000 signatures when the original closure was announced InfraStrata said the yard had been dormant for some time and currently only has one employee - the site manager.

Harris & Sons until it became Appledore Shipbuilders in 1963 Babcock International bought the yard in 2007 Appledore has built elements of two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, including bow sections for the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales The company has built more than 350 vessels, including military craft, super-yachts and ferries GMB organiser Matt Roberts said the union was ""absolutely delighted"" the yard would reopen, adding it had always been ""firmly believed that the yard can be viable and thrive in the right hands"".

"All pupils in England - and many in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - can now be taught face-to-face in school classrooms. What is known about how the virus is transmitted among children and the risk to pupil, teachers and the rest of the community? The risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny. This hasn't changed even with a new, more contagious variant of coronavirus circulating. Despite a rise in the number of children infected during the winter, there was not a substantial rise in hospital admissions. ""As cases in the community rise there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only,"" says Prof Russell Viner, president of Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Among pupils in primary schools, evidence shows that there is limited spread of coronavirus. But teenagers - particularly older teens - are probably more like adults in the way they transmit the virus. In the second wave of England's epidemic in the autumn and early winter,schoolchildren and young adults experienced a much faster rise in infectionsthan other age groups - most likely because they had more opportunities to mingle. During England's November lockdown, schools remained open and operated normally, when many other places had shut down. This is difficult to say. When schools are open, there is more spread among schoolchildren, particularly those at secondary level. There have also been signs that transmission dips after school holidays, such as half-term. But it's hard to say whether children are catching the virus in the classroom, or on the bus or hanging out with friends after school. Rates of infection in schools tend to reflect rates of infection elsewhere. An ONS survey of 100 schools in England, which tested random pupils and staff without symptoms, found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for the infection in November, mirroring an estimated 1.2% infection rate in the general population. Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, has said schools are ""not a significant driver"" of cases of Covid in communities, although she said children could definitely transmit the infection in schools and elsewhere. Sage, the government's scientific advisory group, has suggested opening schools could increase the virus'sreproduction rate or R numberby as much as 30%. But this is highly uncertain and depends a lot in factors like testing, masks and ventilation. Teachers do not seem to be at significantly higher risk than other occupations. In December, 15% of teaching and support staff tested positive for antibodies, giving them an average risk for their age. In contrast, between 25% and 50% of hospital staff had antibodies, while in care homes that had at least one Covid outbreak, two-thirds (66%) of staff had antibodies by the end of the first wave. And overall, teaching and education professionals are no more likely to die of Covid than their peers. Teachers 'not at higher risk' from Covid When will I get a Covid vaccine? Nurses, cleaners, social workers, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and security workers are all at greater risk than teachers, according to the Office for National Statistics. That doesn't tell the whole story, of course - your ethnic background, underlying health conditions, where you live and who you live with are all factors too. Teachers tend to be younger and healthier on average than some other occupations and they're also more likely to be female - all factors which put them in lower risk groups. According to Dr Shamez Ladhani, the chief investigator of the ONS schools survey and a consultant at Public Health England, the long-term harm of keeping children out of school is ""enormous"", but adds that ""the risks are not zero"". Sage says policymakers need to weigh up the benefits and harms of closing schools. This includes reducing the direct health risks to staff, and the negative impact on children's mental health, education, development and wellbeing. Many experts agree this is a difficult balancing act. Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young?

"Job vacancies are at a record high, rising to 1.17 million in the three months to October. Latest figures also show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, despite the end of the furlough scheme. Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were 388,000 more vacancies in this period (August to October 2021) than the three months immediately before the pandemic (January-March 2020), with record highs in 15 of its 18 sector categories. Health The health sector had the most vacancies between July and September with 183,000. The King's Fund think tank says the NHS is facing a""workforce crisis"",external. According tothe latest annual State of the Adult Social Care Sector and Workforce in England report, the sector is struggling to recruit and retain staff, with more unfilled posts now than at the start of the pandemic. The government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the workforce. Care home staff shortage adding pressure on NHS Hospitality The hospitality sector had 151,000 unfilled roles. Industry body UK Hospitality said chefs, security and front of house staff were particularly in demand. The shortage is put down to a number a factors including job security fears in light of Covid, and Brexit. It's leading some businesses to scale back their operations, with restaurants reducing opening hours and hotels closing off parts of their buildings. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? 'Help - I still can't find a job' Retail and transport There were 91,000 vacancies in retail -GreggsandNextare among the high street names which have recently warned of staff shortages in the run-up to Christmas. The British Retail Consortium said there were vacancies across the sector - for example in warehouses and logistics - and its supply chains, like flower-pickers, butchers and distribution centre operators. There is also aUK-wide shortage of lorry drivers, with 53,000 vacancies in the transport sector Staff shortages could last two years, say firms Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years Furlough, the government's main coronavirus job support scheme, finished at the end of September. There were fears this could lead to a spike in unemployment, with employers unable to keep staff on their books without the support it offered. The ONS says it could take a few months for the full impact of furlough to be shown - but the latest figures show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, and strong demand for workers seems to have prevented the feared wave of job cuts. What are my rights if I am made redundant? Jobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, from human resources body the CIPD. Theshortage occupation list,external- used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK - shows where workers are needed. It includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design. Consider your core skills, rather than hunting for a specific job title, suggests Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management. For example, if you work in retail customer service, this could translate to other people-facing roles, such as sales. This video can not be played Ten tips for getting your dream job Many companies list jobs on their own website or on recruitment sites. You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency. If you want to work for a particular company, check if it hires directly, or through a recruiter. And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there. Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available. Some industries and employers have set upvirtual networking events and job fairs.,external Corinne Mills suggests drawing on your personal network. Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, many of whom will be hiring. Employers often respond to personal recommendations, and you may hear about roles before they are advertised. Tech recruiter Amy Golding also recommends: Tailoring your CV and cover letter for each application Emphasising your skills and listing specific achievements such as finishing a project on time and within budget Showing enthusiasm and giving reasons why you want to do this job for this employer Proofreading your materials, including asking someone else to check them for spelling or grammatical errors which could mean your application goes straight in the bin 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Stag and hen-dos should be a thing of the past because of the risk from coronavirus, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. He spoke aftera rise in cases in Cardiff. Mr Gething blamed the ""spike"" in the capital on ""indoor contact rather than outdoor contact"". He warned against pub crawls, and against ignoring health advice on socialising. Under current Welsh law individuals can only meet their own household or extended household when indoors in pubs and restaurants. Meanwhile Mr Gething said a decision may be taken by the end of Wednesday on whether face masks should by worn by school pupils. Schools are due to reopen in Wales next week. Face masks: How is Wales' advice different to England? Coronavirus: 'Re-think face masks in shops' says scientist Keir Starmer says face masks a matter for Welsh ministers Cardiff has been a popular choice for stag and hen dos, with many of the city centre's bars a short walking distance from each other. ""So we've seen a spike in cases in Cardiff, it's still relatively low,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers. ""It's another warning sign for us that the relatively low rates of coronavirus should not lead to people taking risks and ignoring the guidance and the rules that we've provided. ""I don't want people returning to going on a pub crawl again, ignoring the advice about the number of people you should be going out to have a drink with. ""Traditional stag and hen parties, for example, should be things of the past still, because that's lots of people mixing, going out together."" Mr Gething said they were the sort of things ""that you and I may have enjoyed doing in the past are actually things that are much bigger risks now"". Despite his comments about pub crawls, no advice exists on the number of venues drinkers can attend. At the Welsh Government press conference on Tuesday Mr Gething said it was not for the Welsh Government to ""set hard and fast rules about the number of places people can go to"". ""It's really about whether people are prepared to act in a responsible way,"" he said. This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said experts had been asked for new advice on face masks in schools The Scottish Government has announced thatsecondary pupils in Scotlandwill have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses. Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney said the guidance would be updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization (WHO). Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government will get fresh expert advice on the issue later on Tuesday. Plaid Cymru earlier called on the Welsh Government not to ""drag its feet"" after the WHO suggested those over 12 should wear masks in the same settings as adults. Asked when he would take a decision, Mr Gething said: ""I would much rather that if we're in a position there's going to be any change, included changes just around guidance as opposed to mandating anything, that we're able to do so by the end of tomorrow. ""So we're not looking to make a decision late in the week when there's a bank holiday weekend, just before schools are due to reopen."" Earlier he told BBC Radio Wales the WHO guidance was ""not that definitive"". ""We are not ignoring what the World Health Organisation or other governments in the UK are saying,"" he said. But Mr Gething was concerned that wearing masks could lead to other problems. ""I don't want lots of masks discarded in schools and on school transport because they then become (a risk) to other pupils and to other adults as well,"" he added.

"Sheridan Smith says she had become addicted to her anxiety medication Sheridan Smith has revealed she was rushed to hospital and had five seizures after she stopped taking anti-anxiety medication. Smith said she ""went off the deep end"" after the 2016 TV Bafta Awards ceremony, where she was nominated for her performance in The C Word. She was left ""humiliated"" by jokes made by the host Graham Norton about her ""being a drunk"", she said. She then stopped her medication that night, not realising it was dangerous. BBC News has asked Norton's representatives for a comment. The Cilla and Gavin and Stacey star, made the revelations in a forthcoming ITV special documentary called Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum, which tells the story of her mental health struggles and her journey to motherhood. In the film, she recalled: ""Graham Norton was hosting and made a joke, basically at my expense, about me being a drunk. Bafta TV Awards host Graham Norton suggested Sheridan Smith was drunk at the ceremony ""I was so humiliated, you know, it's a room full of your peers. And people you want to work with, or have worked with. ""That night, for me, was like the final straw before my brain totally went off the deep end. ""What people didn't realise is that I'd become addicted to anti-anxiety tablets."" During the Bafta ceremony, Norton said: ""We're all excited for a couple of drinks tonight. Or, as it's known in theatrical circles, a few glasses of technical difficulties."" The comment was a reference to Smith's departure from a performance of the stage show Funny Girl, which the theatre management said was due to ""technical difficulties"". She later pulled out of the show altogether due to mental health issues. In the ITV documentary, Smith said that after the Baftas she went back to her hotel room and she decided to stop taking the tablets she had been prescribed for her condition. It was only due to her friend unexpectedly coming to the hotel to see her that she was able to get help. ""It's a miracle she did (come). It's like someone was looking out for me because what I didn't realise is that if you stop these tablets abruptly, you seizure,"" said Smith. Sheridan Smith's fiance filmed her at home for ITV's Isolation Stories ""I seizured five times and got rushed to A&E and she's the one who got me breathing again."" Smith, who recently had her first child, told the programme that she now feels ""calm"" and ""contentment"". The actress had an emergency caesarean to deliver her son Billy early this summer, while the country was in lockdown. During that period she also made one of the short drama films for the ITV's Isolation Stories series. She played Mel, a heavily pregnant woman who faces having to go through birth without the married father of her child - who's chosen to stay with his wife and family. For the new documentary, cameras followed Smith as she attended her first scans, pre-natal classes and sessions with a specialist therapist, as well as at home with fiancÃ© Jamie Horn. Smith said she wanted to help other women who worry about their mental health issues resurfacing in pregnancy. ""The day he smiled at me was more amazing and emotional even than the day he was born, because you suddenly think, 'Oh my god - you love me back!',"" she said of her baby. ""Suddenly all those sleepless nights and all that worry goes out the window."" The documentary also sees the actress explore family issues that she feels could have affected her mental health, including the death of her brother when he was 18 and she was eight, and the death of her father in 2016. Over the past three years, Smith, who is also an Olivier Award-winning stage actress, has done more TV including BBC One's The Moorside and ITV's Cleaning Up. Last year she made a return to the West End as the narrator in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

"Secondary schools in England might be using face masks after a change of policy Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors in local lockdown areas of England, after the government reversed its guidance. Head teachers in any secondary school will also have the ""flexibility"" to introduce masks in their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it followed updated advice from the World Health Organization. But Labour accused the government of ""passing the buck"" on decisions back to schools. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new guidance meant that in coronavirus ""hot spot"" areas that ""it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face covering in the corridor and elsewhere"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says face coverings should be worn ""outside the classroom"" in secondary schools in hotspot areas The change in rules, announced on Tuesday night, will not mean face coverings in the classroom - which Mr Johnson said would have been ""nonsensical"" as ""you can't teach with face coverings and you can't expect people to learn with face coverings."" Mr Johnson, at a school in Leicestershire, told pupils their exam grades were ""almost derailed by a mutant algorithm"" and the biggest risk to them was not Covid-19, but ""continuing to be out of school"". His comments came just before the government announced a change in the leadership at the top of the Department for Education. The most senior civil servant in the department, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, has been asked to stand down. A statement said the prime minister had concluded there was ""a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education"". It added: ""Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September in advance of the end of his tenure in Spring 2021."" The policy switch on face coverings, so near to the return to school, had drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman said the use of face coverings sent ""the wrong message"" which suggested ""schools are not a safe setting"". Late U-turn on face masks frustrates teachers PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? Ditch truancy fines, say doctors as pupils return Mr Williamson insisted the government was listening ""to the latest medical and scientific advice"" and taking ""the most precautionary approach"". The Department for Education says it is still keeping its recommendation against using face coverings - but that secondary schools will now be able to make their own decisions whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them. This will be in ""communal areas"" of schools such as corridors, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and when schools ""believe that is right in their particular circumstances"". But in parts of the country with high levels of coronavirus transmission, such asthose with local lockdown,externalmeasures, face coverings will be compulsory in such communal areas for adults and pupils. The return to school in Germany - but the PM says masks would be ""nonsensical"" in classrooms and would disrupt learning The new guidelines, which apply from 1 September, also warn that ""stricter guidance"" on face coverings could apply to all schools ""if the rate of transmission increases across the whole country"". On Wednesday the Department for Education said all schools would be supplied with 10 coronavirus testing kits, to be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" when no other way of testing is available. They would also be given a ""small amount"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as aprons, gloves, visors and clinical face masks. The change on face coverings follows the WHO updating its advice last week, which now recommends thatchildren aged over 12 should wear masksunder the same conditions as adults. The government had been under pressure over face coverings in England's schools - with secondary schools in Scotland to use them in corridors and communal areas from next week. Northern Ireland isalso now recommending face coveringsfor secondary school corridors, while Wales has left the decision up to head teachers, but highlights advice which recommends them inside where social distancing cannot be maintained, including on school transport. The ASCL head teachers' union had warned of confusion about the rules over face coverings - and said there was a lack of clarity over how schools should respond if teachers or pupils wanted to wear masks. This video can not be played Tulip Siddiq says the government must give âclearer guidanceâ on students wearing face masks in English schools After the government's change of policy, the union's leader, Geoff Barton, said school leaders would ""welcome the flexibility"" of being able to ""decide what best suits their circumstances"". But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It is neither helpful or fair to ask school leaders to make individual decisions about face coverings in their school. Such decisions should rest with public health officials."" Kevin Courtney, of the National Education Union, welcomed ""the steps now being taken"" but criticised the ""slow, incoherent"" way the decision had been reached - and said it would not inspire confidence with parents or teachers. Conservative MP Huw Merriman said the change in guidance was ""causing uncertainty"". ""My concern is that we just keep making this up as we go along,"" the Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government ""needs to get a grip"". Asked whether he took responsibility for the decisions made on face coverings and exam grades, Mr Williamson admitted it had been ""incredibly difficult and incredibly tough"". ""At every stage, everyone takes responsibility for what they do and how they approach things and what we're focused on is making sure we deliver the best for children right across the country,"" he told BBC Breakfast. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Some parents said they wanted to see face coverings mandatory in communal areas of all secondary schools. Pamela Allen, from Canterbury, said her son's secondary school had told her it would be following government guidance and would not require face coverings to be worn. ""I think [the government] should be leading the charge against the virus as opposed to reacting to it if there is a local lockdown,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make us feel confident that we are sending our children to as safe a place as we can."" She added she would be sending her son to school with a face covering to wear between lessons. A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school Despite the official guidance against face coverings, some schools had already been preparing to use them. The Oasis academy trust, with more than 50 schools in England, is to provide visors for its teachers - and secondary pupils were going to have to wear masks in corridors. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the trust, said there was a responsibility to make schools ""as safe as we possibly can"" - and that meant using masks and visors. He said that masks might increase the confidence of parents ""nervous"" about sending their children back to school. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas of schools. ""Instead of this half baked U-turn, the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it,"" she said.

"Sally Collier appeared before the education select committee by webcam in June The head of England's exams regulator, Sally Collier, has quit after thousands of students' marks were downgraded for exams they were unable to sit. Ofqual chief Ms Collier has been under fire for a controversial algorithm which changed GCSE and A-level marks, making them unfair, according to heads. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson thanked her for her commitment.

""Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right."" Meanwhile, National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""Someone had to take responsibility for the exams fiasco, but the issue runs far deeper than the actions of one chief executive. ""We have no sure way of knowing where the balance of fault lies, but we can be quite certain that Gavin Williamson gave direction to Ofqual that there should not be grade inflation and all candidates should get a fair grade."" The previous chief of Ofqual, Dame Glenys Stacey, has been asked to step in. She will run the next stage of the exams process on a temporary basis until December, the Ofqual board said, along with the chief of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, who previously worked at Ofqual. Exams for GCSE and A-level students were cancelled by Mr Williamson in March, just before schools were closed, when the nation was in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic. A system to ensure pupils could still get their grades was drawn up by Ofqual which involved teachers and schools predicting grades for their pupils from a whole range of evidence These were then sent to the exams regulator to be moderated so as to avoid more students than usual getting higher grades. The now discredited algorithm used information on schools' past performance to moderate the grades, drawing complaints that pupils were being judged on the efforts of the predecessors. How did the exam algorithm work? Scotland, which used a similar system, rowed back on the arrangement after it became apparent that many bright but disadvantaged pupils were downgraded. Scotland's education secretary John Swinney announced a switch to teacher-assessed grades and results were re-issued. But it was not until two weeks afterthose results were awardedthat his counterpart in England, Gavin Williamson, decided to revert to what are known as centre-assessed grades. Sally Collier refused requests for interviews last week This meant that hundreds of thousands of A-level results had to be re-issued and GCSE results were rushed through to schools to be released three days after the government U-turn. And hundreds of thousands of the BTec students have still not received their grades after the exam board, Pearson, made a last minute decision to re-grade. Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons education committee, said Ms Collier agreed to appear before MPs next week only a few days ago. ""I want her still to come because we want to find out, while she was in charge, what went on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""I very much hope that will be the case."" He added: ""There is a very human level to this and she is a public servant and you have every sympathy for her because she is a nice individual and no doubt dedicated and hard working but clearly things have gone badly wrong. ""Whether if she'd had a strong education background, whether that would have made a difference, who knows? ""Unfortunately there have been a lot of fingers in this awful algorithm pie."" Mr Williamson said: ""Following Sally Collier's decision to step down as Ofqual's Chief Regulator, I'd like to thank her for the commitment she has shown to the role over the last four years and wish her well for the future. ""I welcome Ofqual's announcement that Dame Glenys Stacey is to assume a temporary leadership role as acting chief regulator and also the new internal governance arrangements put in place with Ofsted support. ""This will make sure Ofqual can fully focus on the important functions it must deliver as the independent regulator for qualifications, examinations and assessments in England."" Head of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said: ""The future remains uncertain in the light of the current pandemic. The current plans are to prepare for a full exam series next summer - best case scenario. ""But the real risk that there will be further disruptions next academic year must be recognised and contingency plans for a range of possibilities need to be put in place.

"Sally Collier appeared before the education select committee by webcam in June The head of England's exams regulator, Sally Collier, has quit after thousands of students' marks were downgraded for exams they were unable to sit. Ofqual chief Ms Collier has been under fire for a controversial algorithm which changed GCSE and A-level marks, making them unfair, according to heads. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson thanked her for her commitment.

Thank you for joining us and we hope we will see you again on Wednesday morning. And if you are just joining us in the UK here is what you may have missed. Thechief regulator of exams watchdog Ofqual has resignedfollowing the chaos which surrounded this year's A-level, GCSE and BTec results. Sally Collier quit after thousands of students were downgraded by a computer algorithm, which led to accusations of pupils in more deprived areas being treated unfairly. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. In other news: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the world from the day: The EU's trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations while in Ireland despite attending a golf dinner with 80 other guests. Phil Hogan has provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen after she requested further details about his trip home earlier this month. Mr Hogan was among the guests at a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In adocument published on the European Commission website,external, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August which he said ""ended the self-restriction period"". Mr Hogan told Irish broadcaster RTÃ: ""I am satisfied arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative that I was no risk to anybody."" The top doctor at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has apologised for overstating the benefits of patients blood plasma in the treatment of Covid-19. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn came under fire after his agency on Sunday gave emergency authorisation to use convalescent plasma on coronavirus patients. Echoing President Donald Trump, Mr Hahn touted the treatment as life-saving. But scientists quickly questioned the data provided by Mr Hahn, who suggested plasma could reduce deaths by 35% - a claim which grossly exaggerated preliminary findings from a clinic at the Mayo Clinic. Mr Hahn told CBS News he could have ""done a better job"" of explaining what the data shows. He maintained that the decision to authorise the treatment for emergency use was made by FDA career scientists, ""based upon sound science and data"". Mr Hahn has faced criticism for appearing to play politics, backing the Trump administration amid its push for a breakthrough treatment of Covid-19 in the run-up to the presidential election on 3 November. The plasma announcement came a day after Mr Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons. Read the full storyhere. The Netherlands has seen a slight drop in the number of coronavirus cases in the past week - down by 425 from 4,013 to 3,588 compared with the previous week, according to the RIVM public health institute. But a quarter of new cases involved people
who had returned from abroad. Some 867 who returned tested positive in the past week, mainly from France (161) and Spain (278), Dutch media report. Meanwhile, hospital admissions in the country have gone up sharply, from 50 last week to 84 in the past seven days, Dutch media report. The number of deaths has also doubled from 16 to 32. At the beginning of the month, PM Mark Rutte said the virus was rising at a dangerous rate. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external, the Netherlands still has among the highest infection rates in Europe per 100,000 people (currently 45), reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.  A further 16 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days of dying have been recorded in the UK. It takes the total number of deaths which have been linked to coronavirus in the country to 41,449. There were a further 1,184 new cases reported in the previous 24 hours, official figures showed on Tuesday. It takes total cases to 327,798. Mexico City's famous ""floating gardens"" which had been closed to tourists because of the pandemic have now reopened after a five-month coronavirus shutdown. They feature the city's iconic trajineras boats which can be found at the Nativitas canal pier in Xochimilco, in a network of canals and floating gardens, originally built by the Aztecs.  The boats were thoroughly disinfected ahead of reopening to visitors at the weekend. But coronavirus restrictions mean numbers are now limited and face masks are compulsory. Mexico has been hit hard by the pandemic,recording the world's third highest death toll. It has more than 560,000 cases of the virus and more than 60,000 deaths. Some 3,700 Swedes were told they had Covid, butit then turned out the results were wrong,external. Sweden's Public Health Agency said on Tuesday that faulty PCR test kits had returned some 3,700 false positive results back in March. Mostly ""people who had mild symptoms or who didn't feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results"", the agency said in a statement. The agency added it would contact those affected this week and adjust Sweden's official number of cases. The error was discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls. The agency said the kits were made by a company in China and had been distributed worldwide. It says it has alerted the World Health Organization.  Virgin Atlantic has won backing from its creditors for a Â£1.2bn rescue planthat will secure its future for at least the next 18 months. The airline said shareholders, banks, aircraft owners and suppliers owed money had approved the plan. Virgin Atlantic said ""this milestone"" puts it in a position to ""rebuild its balance sheet"" and ""welcome passengers back"". It had warned it would run out of cash by September without the deal. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. More than 64 millions meals have been served up as part of the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out discount scheme, according to the Treasury. The scheme offers diners up to Â£10 off their meals when they eat in restaurants, cafes and pubs between Monday and Wednesday in a bid to boost the pandemic hit hospitality sector.

Eat Out to Help Out is due to finish at the end of the month and has seen 87,000 claims made by businesses. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Todayâs figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality â with more than 64 million meals discounted so far, thatâs equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs. ""This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out, and in doing so, how this is helping to protect the jobs of nearly 2 million people who work in hospitality.""

capital Delhi has seen coronavirus cases rise by more than a quarter over the
previous week, according to the latest data. More
than 9,000 positive cases were recorded in the week from 18 August to 24
August, up from just over 7,200 the previous week. Thereâs

Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""There is a growing body of evidence that the use of face masks in communal areas in secondary schools helps protect students and staff and drive down transmission. ""The prime minister must listen to this evidence and act quickly to give certainty to parents and teachers who are just days away from schools reopening."" It comes after Scotland announced that pupils will have tocover their faces in corridors and on school transport from Monday. In Wales, the government has said it will review the use of face coverings in school with a decision expected to be made on Wednesday. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it is important that any decisions are ""proportionate"" and ""appropriate to their setting, and local population"".

Some 45% of Americans said they had managed to set more money aside than usual, while 26% were paying back debt faster than they had been before the pandemic, the poll conducted byThe Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research,externalfound. In total, about half of Americans say theyâve either saved more or paid back debt since the outbreak began. Health fears and compulsory closures meant many Americans have gone out less and as a result spent less on meals out, clothes and travel. Meanwhile, nearly 13 million people have lost a job, AP reports, andmore than 28 million people - nearly one fifth of the American workforce - were collecting some form of unemployment paymentin the week ending 1 August.

Scientists believe they have traced the first UK coronavirus case to a woman in Nottinghamshire. Analysis of samples by the University of Nottingham showed a 75-year-old woman, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February. A Surrey resident waspreviously believedto have caught the virus first. The woman is also understood to be first in the UK to die after contracting Covid-19.

Speaking to Reuters news agency, he said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines.

It comes as US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA [emergency use authorisation] before you have a signal of efficacy,"" Dr Fauci said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial. ""To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. Read more on this story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A US judge has ruled that, for now, Apple can continue to block the video game Fortnite from its App Store. However the tech giant cannot terminate Epic Games' developer accounts or compromise its graphics tool Unreal Engine, which is used by many third-party game creators. This is until a full hearing can take place on 28 September. Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store after Epic deliberately broke its rules in protest at Apple's policies. Epic said Apple had also threatened to take away its access to developer tools. In her ruling,external, as reported by The Verge, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote that Epic had not demonstrated that Apple's actions so far had caused the ""irreparable harm"" it claimed in its legal papers. However, she also wrote that Apple had ""chosen to act severely"" by threatening to block the Unreal Engine, which is widely used by others. ""Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,"" she said. However regarding Fortnite, Epic had ""strategically chosen to breach its agreements with Apple,"" she said. The App Store conditions state that Apple takes 30% of revenue generated from in-app digital purchases, and developers are not allowed to signpost that prices may be cheaper outside the app. Google takes the same cut on its Play Store. Both removed Fortnite from their stores after Epic offered a discount on its in-game currency V Bucks if they were purchased on the website instead. On Monday,Microsoft backed Epic in the dispute.

It marks the first time the Met Office has had two named storms in August since it started the process in 2015. Forecasters said the winds were ""unusual"" for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of 87mph recorded at The Needles in August 1996. Likewise, the wettest August on record in the UK was in 1912 when 167.3mm was recorded across the country as a whole. Between 1 and 22 August, the UK as a whole had seen some 72.7mm of rainfall - around four-fifths of the average rainfall for the month. No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next storm will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on 1 September. Have you been affected by Storm Francis?

"Face coverings will only be required in corridors, communal areas and on buses Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday. Education Secretary John Swinney said the new rules would apply to all pupils aged over 12. He saidthe guidance,externalhad been updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization(WHO). There will be no requirement to wear face coverings in classrooms where distancing measures are in place. Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? WHO says children over 12 should wear masks Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? Mr Swinney said individual exemptions could be granted for health reasons, but the guidance would be ""obligatory"" for all secondary, special and grant-aided schools. He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""From August 31st young people over the age of 12 in secondary schools should habitually be wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal areas where it is difficult to deliver the physical distancing."" He said the Scottish government had acted in the light of the new WHO advice based on evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults, but had decided to go further by extending it to school transport. ""It's part of the general measures we are taking to ensure we keep pace with the emerging advice about how to keep our schools open and to keep our schools safe,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signalled on Monday that a change in the guidance was imminent. The new rules for school buses will apply to pupils over the age of five, in line with guidelines for public transport. Staff and students can continue to wear face coverings in all settings voluntarily if they wish. Eileen Prior, executive director of the parents' organisation Connect, formerly known as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, earlier said she hoped schools would be offered some flexibility over how the new guidance was implemented. She said: ""In some schools it won't be necessary - it depends very much on the environment within a school. ""Some schools are incredibly crowded but some simply aren't and some are well below capacity, perhaps with wide corridors and they don't have the issue that we have in many high schools of young people just crowding because they just can't not crowd."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âIf we need to change the advice then of course we willâ But Mr Swinney said while the new rules were not mandatory, they had the same status as other guidance on reopening of schools, such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, and should be considered ""obligatory"" across the secondary sector. ""There will be exemptions from this because the wearing of face coverings is not suitable for all individuals and that has to be respected,"" he said. He also stressed that an individual pupil should not be excluded from a school because they were not wearing a face covering. The UK government has said there are ""no plans"" to introduce similar measures when schools return in England after the summer break. Head teachers, however,have complained about a lack of clarityand asked whether English schools would have the flexibility to allow masks if requested as a safety measure by teachers. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the revised guidance in Scotland was a sensible move. She said: ""The schools have done brilliantly well getting going again but I think their physical distancing in some of the communal areas is always going to be a bit of a challenge to enforce... when we've still got cases circulating in the community this will provide additional protection when it's difficult to physically distance."" She said there may be more work to do to educate young people about the correct way to put on or remove a face covering. ""Not touching the surface - taking it off around the ears. I would recommend young people might carry a little bag in their pocket, stick the face covering in there and when they're taking it off and when they're putting it back on, making sure they don't touch the front of it,"" she said. ""And then of course there's the cleaning issue - these coverings need to be washed, just in warm water and soap."" The interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the education advisory group had considered carefully whether poor hygiene while using masks might spread the virus. ""In their consideration they looked at the evidence from infection from removing masks, on and off, and whether that was likely to play a significant component in terms of introducing an increased risk of transmission,"" he said. ""On balance, their assessment of that evidence was that there was insufficient evidence to support that view."" The EIS teaching union welcomed the announcement as a ""sensible and appropriate step"" but repeated its call for investment in more teaching staff to allow smaller class sizes. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""There needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Thousands of patients are likely to have been infected with coronavirus in UK hospitals, a study suggests. The King's College London study of 10 UK hospital sites plus one in Italy found at least one in eight patients who had received hospital treatment for coronavirus had caught it on-site. Researchers said that was a relatively low rate and showed there was effective infection control in place. They analysed data on 1,500 cases to 28 April, covering the peak in the UK. Lead author Dr Ben Carter said: ""The majority of these patients had already been in hospital for a long time. ""They were older, frailer and had pre-existing health conditions."" But they also had better outcomes than those admitted with the virus, probably because of faster diagnosis and, therefore, treatment. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Only those who tested positive 15 days or more after admission were counted as hospital-acquired infections, however. And if patients who tested positive after five to 14 days are included, the proportion increases to 23%. But, because of the long incubation period of the virus, it is impossible to be sure how many of these patients would have been infected in hospital. Prof Duncan Young, an expert in intensive-care medicine at Oxford University, said the study would also not have captured those infected during a short hospital stay, as patients were not followed up after discharge. And of course the study only looked at people who were being treated in hospital for coronavirus, so did not include the vast majority of people who caught the disease and either showed no illness or just recovered at home with no need for treatment. Those caveats do suggest the the risk of catching the virus in hospital remains still small.

"Olga Freeman is accused of killing her son Dylan A woman admitted killing her severely disabled 10-year-old son in a call to her friend, an inquest has heard. Police discovered the body of Dylan Freeman, who had autism and Cohen syndrome at his home in Cumberland Park, Acton, on 16 August. West London Coroner's Court on Tuesday heard Dylan died after his airways had been restricted by a sponge. His mother and primary carer, Olga Freeman,appeared at the Old Baileylast week accused of his murder. Senior coroner Chinyere Inyama said doctors had recently prescribed Ms Freeman antidepressant tablets. Mr Inyama said: ""His mother called a friend in the early hours to state to the friend that she killed her son."" He said the mother and her friend went to Acton police station in west London and told them what had happened. The coroner said it appeared Dylan had been administered a sleeping aid. A sponge was then placed in his mouth, tied with a strap. The body of Dylan Freeman was found at a house in Cumberland Park, Acton Dylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities on many parts of the body - and other issues. Dylan's father, celebrity photographer Dean Freeman, last week described his son as ""a beautiful, bright, inquisitive and artistic child who loved to travel, visit art galleries and swim"". His body was identified four days later by his headteacher. Mr Inyama gave restriction of the airways as the preliminary cause of death. There was no other evidence of injuries caused by assault or restraint. Mr Inyama adjourned the inquest until March 2021, pending the outcome of any legal proceedings. Ms Freeman is due to appear for a plea and trial preparation hearing at the Old Bailey on 4 November.

"This video can not be played Brits should end ""this general bout of self-recrimination and wetnessâ says the PM Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is opposed to the BBC's decision to play instrumental versions of Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! at the Last Night of the Proms next month. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history,"" he told reporters. Media reports have suggested the lyrics are being dropped due to associations with colonialism and slavery. But the BBC says the decision was prompted by Covid-19 restrictions. Fewer performers will be allowed on stage, which makes it harder to perform the songs with a traditional chorus. A BBC spokesperson said: ""For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year.  We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be different but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditional return next year."" Earlier, the BBC's director general Tony Hall said he felt the move to include instrumental versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory for this year's performance was the right one. ""I think they have come to the right conclusion,"" he told the BBC's media editor, Amol Rajan. ""It's very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over 5,000 people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night of the Proms and to have things where the whole audience normally sing along - it's quite hard creatively, artistically to make that work."" This video can not be played Tony Hall: ""I think they have come to the right conclusion which is actually to include it instrumentally"" He added: ""We have come to the right conclusion which is a creative conclusion, an artistic conclusion... it is there in a medley of instrumentals playing around sea shanties and all of that and I suspect it will be back next year."" The concert is due to take place on 12 September, without an audience and with limited performers at the Royal Albert Hall, due to concerns around Covid-19. Responding to the news of this year's changes, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I cannot believe... that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land Of Hope And Glory or Rule Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness. ""I wanted to get that off my chest,"" he added. A Labour Party spokesperson responded: ""The pomp and pageantry of the Last Night of the Proms is a staple of British summer. ""The running order is a matter for the organisers and the BBC, but enjoying patriotic songs does not - and should not - present a barrier to examining our past and learning lessons from it."" In a statement on Monday evening, BBC Proms said it was announcing the concert's programme following recent speculation. The whole debate was initially sparked by an article in The Sunday Times, whichsuggested the songs could be droppedcompletely in the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter protests. The newspaper claimed there were concerns by key members of the orchestra about their associations with the British Empire, colonialism and slavery. Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, Britannia Could the BBC Proms drop Rule, Britannia? Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules The Proms said there would be new orchestral versions of Land Of Hope And Glory, and Rule, Britannia!, as well as a new arrangement of Jerusalem, which will be sung. ""With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time, including You'll Never Walk Alone, presenting a poignant and inclusive event for 2020,"" the statement said. Ivor Novello-winning composer Errollyn Wallen confirmed online on Monday evening that she is making the new arrangement of Proms favourite, Jerusalem, ""In it I remember the Commonwealth nations and am dedicating the work to the Windrush generation,""tweeted,externalthe Belize-born British musician. Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, told Times Radio he felt the BBC ""is always in a panic about race, and one of the reasons it is always in a panic is that it has no confidence"". ""The principal reason it has no confidence... is that there is no ethnic diversity at the top of its decision-making tree. ""What you have is rooms full of white men panicking that someone is going to think they are racist."" Broadcaster and choirmaster Gareth Malone has suggested the anthems are outdated, tweeting: ""It's time for Rule Britannia! to go."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the 2020 move was ""all very sad"", adding: ""There's some lovely words to Rule Britannia."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he called for a ""compromise"" of a single voice performing the tune, rather than the usual sing-along version. ""Let's just have a single voice singing those words proudly,"" he said. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of tradition, and it's a beautiful tune."" Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. She told the BBC: ""We find it offensive. ""For any conscious black person who is aware of their history, the empire and colonialism, for example, they will struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs.""

"A US judge has ruled that, for now, Apple can continue to block the video game Fortnite from its App Store. However the tech giant cannot terminate Epic Games' developer accounts or compromise its graphics tool Unreal Engine, which is used by many third-party game creators. This is until a full hearing can take place on 28 September. Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store after Epic deliberately broke its rules in protest at Apple's policies. Epic said Apple had also threatened to take away its access to developer tools. In her ruling,external, as reported by The Verge, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote that Epic had not demonstrated that Apple's actions so far had caused the ""irreparable harm"" it claimed in its legal papers. However, she also wrote that Apple had ""chosen to act severely"" by threatening to block the Unreal Engine, which is widely used by others. ""Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,"" she said. However regarding Fortnite, Epic had ""strategically chosen to breach its agreements with Apple,"" she said. The App Store conditions state that Apple takes 30% of revenue generated from in-app digital purchases, and developers are not allowed to signpost that prices may be cheaper outside the app. Google takes the same cut on its Play Store. Both removed Fortnite from their stores after Epic offered a discount on its in-game currency V Bucks if they were purchased on the website instead. On Monday,Microsoft backed Epic in the dispute. Xbox head Phil Spencer tweeted: ""Ensuring that Epic has access to the latest Apple technology is the right thing for game developers and gamers.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This is the greatest scam in the history of politics"" US President Donald Trump has warned his fellow Republicans their opponents may ""steal"" November's election, as his party anointed him as their candidate. ""They're using Covid to defraud the American people,"" Mr Trump told delegates on the first day of the party convention in North Carolina. He repeated an untrue claim that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud. An unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? Experts and voting officials have dismissed the claim that mail-in voting leads to fraud as a false conspiracy theory. Mr Trump himself uses the system regularly. Opinion polls suggest he is lagging behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Mr Biden, the former vice-president to Barack Obama, has boasted a 10-point lead on occasions. Addressing delegates in person at a party conference that has been dramatically scaled back by the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Trump accused Democrats of ""using Covid to steal an election"". Rising stars of a post-Trump Republican party shine The son who is Trumpier than Trump Convention schedule: Melania to headline day two ""The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election,""Â heÂ said. ""We're going to win."" Mr Trump hadalso warned of a ""rigged"" election in 2016, as he trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls. But in 2016 the polls were far less clear and just a few percentage points separated Mr Trump and his then-rival Hillary Clinton at several points as election day neared. This video can not be played 'My father's entire worldview is that we can always do even better' On Monday, Mr Trump was officially nominated as a formality to be the Republican nominee at his party's convention in the city of Charlotte. Supporters cheered him, chanting: ""Four more years!"" The president is expected to make live television addresses on every day of the convention, leading up to his acceptance speech to the party jamboree on Thursday. It is unusual for candidates to address the convention before that point, as Mr Trump has done. Supporters cheer for Mr Trump during his visit to North Carolina Mr Trump has repeatedly asserted that expanded mail-in voting will lead to ""the most corrupt election"" in US history. But there is scant evidence of widespread voter fraud, and very few examples of any related criminal prosecutions. The rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice,external. Ellen Weintraub, commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud. None."" Mail-in voting is used by the US military, and even Mr Trump himself and members of his family. But a recent slowdown in mail deliveries due to cost-saving measures in the US postal system has fuelled concerns that ballots might not be returned by election day. What is US row over postal service about? Several states have sought to change their election laws to allow ballots to be counted days after the forthcoming presidential vote, which some analysts fear could lead to delays in declaring the presidential victor. A delegate in North Carolina wears a mask with the Republican Party's elephant logo A primary election in New York City this June took weeks to determine a winner after poll officials were deluged with 10 times the normal number of mail-in ballots. There was no allegation of fraud, but the debacle raised fears of a protracted vote count this November. Earlier this month, a New Jersey judge ordered a new vote after finding evidence of fraud in a May election that was conducted entirely by mail in Paterson. Four people were arrested, including a local city councilman and councilman-elect. The case has been frequently touted by the Trump campaign. The first night of the Republican National Convention was a two-and-a-half hour rebuttal to the accusations Democrats levelled at Donald Trump during the four nights of their convention last week. Did the president mishandle the coronavirus pandemic? The Republicans offered slick videos and first-hand accounts of the steps the president took to speed medical research, provide protective supplies and implement economic relief. Is the president inflaming racial divisions in the US? Former football star Herschel Walker spoke of his 37-year friendship with Mr Trump. Tim Scott, the first black Republican elected to the Senate in nearly 50 years, touted the president's work on sentencing reform and tax breaks for economically distressed communities. Does the president lack empathy? Congressman Jim Jordan spoke of how Mr Trump offered sympathies when a relative died, and the president himself held a pre-taped White House forum where he offered words of support for coronavirus survivors and healthcare workers. Polls suggest American voters have serious doubts about the president on all these issues - doubts that predated the Democratic convention attacks. Republicans have four days to assuage these concerns, chip away at Democratic opponent Joe Biden's lead and remind supporters what they like about Mr Trump's presidency. It's an imposing task, but the Republicans have identified what work has to be done. Republicans said Monday night's theme was ""Land of Promise"" and pledged their convention would be less ""negative"" than the Democrats' conference last week. But many of the Republican speakers warned in doom-laden tones what would happen if Americans voted in a President Biden. Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr said the Democratic presidential candidate was ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Were these the three hours that upset Trump's campaign? Florida congressman Matt Gaetz warned of a ""horror movie"" if Democrats won the White House. ""They'll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door,"" he said referring to a Central American immigrant street gang. Charlie Kirk, who runs conservative student groupÂ Turning Point USA, told viewers: ""Trump was elected to protect our families - our loved ones - from the vengeful mob that wishes to destroy our way of life, our neighbourhoods, schools, church and values."" This video can not be played The St Louis couple arrested after pointing guns at protesters address the Republican convention Former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley described facing discrimination as an Indian-American growing up in the South. ""I was a brown girl in a black and white world,"" she said. But she described the ""fashionable"" idea that America is a racist country as a ""lie"". What really went on in St Louis that day? The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career After Mr Biden implied in last week's speech to his party convention that Mr Trump was a racist, the Republican conference sought to deflect that charge back on Democrats. In a bid to woo a constituency that is crucial to Democratic electoral hopes, African-American speakers lavished praise on the president on Monday night. The headline speaker was South Carolina Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator. He said his grandfather had been forced out of school so he could pick cotton, but lived long enough to see his grandson elected. ""Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,"" he told delegates. He said America had made ""tremendous progress"" towards racial equality during the Trump presidency. This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' Former NFL star Herschel Walker, who is black, said: ""It hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is 'racist'. ""I take it as a personal insult that people would think I've had a 37-year friendship with a racist."" Georgia state representative Vernon Jones, a Democrat, accused his party of taking the black vote for granted. ""The Democratic Party does not want black people to leave the mental plantation they've had us on for decades,"" he said, evoking the legacy of slavery. Kim Klacik, a black Republican candidate for Maryland's Baltimore district, accused Mr Biden of believing that black people ""can't think for ourselves - that the colour of someone's skin dictates their political views"". A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center,externalsuggests that 83% of black voters identify or lean towards the Democratic Party, compared with just 10% who say they are Republican, or lean towards identifying as one.

Thechief regulator of exams watchdog Ofqual has resignedfollowing the chaos which surrounded this year's A-level, GCSE and BTec results. Sally Collier quit after thousands of students were downgraded by a computer algorithm, which led to accusations of pupils in more deprived areas being treated unfairly. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. In other news: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the world from the day: The EU's trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations while in Ireland despite attending a golf dinner with 80 other guests. Phil Hogan has provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen after she requested further details about his trip home earlier this month. Mr Hogan was among the guests at a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In adocument published on the European Commission website,external, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August which he said ""ended the self-restriction period"". Mr Hogan told Irish broadcaster RTÃ: ""I am satisfied arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative that I was no risk to anybody."" The top doctor at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has apologised for overstating the benefits of patients blood plasma in the treatment of Covid-19. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn came under fire after his agency on Sunday gave emergency authorisation to use convalescent plasma on coronavirus patients. Echoing President Donald Trump, Mr Hahn touted the treatment as life-saving. But scientists quickly questioned the data provided by Mr Hahn, who suggested plasma could reduce deaths by 35% - a claim which grossly exaggerated preliminary findings from a clinic at the Mayo Clinic. Mr Hahn told CBS News he could have ""done a better job"" of explaining what the data shows. He maintained that the decision to authorise the treatment for emergency use was made by FDA career scientists, ""based upon sound science and data"". Mr Hahn has faced criticism for appearing to play politics, backing the Trump administration amid its push for a breakthrough treatment of Covid-19 in the run-up to the presidential election on 3 November. The plasma announcement came a day after Mr Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons. Read the full storyhere. The Netherlands has seen a slight drop in the number of coronavirus cases in the past week - down by 425 from 4,013 to 3,588 compared with the previous week, according to the RIVM public health institute. But a quarter of new cases involved people
who had returned from abroad. Some 867 who returned tested positive in the past week, mainly from France (161) and Spain (278), Dutch media report.

Speaking to Reuters news agency, he said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines.

It comes as US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA [emergency use authorisation] before you have a signal of efficacy,"" Dr Fauci said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial.

"Sheridan Smith says she had become addicted to her anxiety medication Sheridan Smith has revealed she was rushed to hospital and had five seizures after she stopped taking anti-anxiety medication. Smith said she ""went off the deep end"" after the 2016 TV Bafta Awards ceremony, where she was nominated for her performance in The C Word. She was left ""humiliated"" by jokes made by the host Graham Norton about her ""being a drunk"", she said. She then stopped her medication that night, not realising it was dangerous. BBC News has asked Norton's representatives for a comment. The Cilla and Gavin and Stacey star, made the revelations in a forthcoming ITV special documentary called Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum, which tells the story of her mental health struggles and her journey to motherhood.

Bafta TV Awards host Graham Norton suggested Sheridan Smith was drunk at the ceremony ""I was so humiliated, you know, it's a room full of your peers. And people you want to work with, or have worked with. ""That night, for me, was like the final straw before my brain totally went off the deep end. ""What people didn't realise is that I'd become addicted to anti-anxiety tablets."" During the Bafta ceremony, Norton said: ""We're all excited for a couple of drinks tonight. Or, as it's known in theatrical circles, a few glasses of technical difficulties."" The comment was a reference to Smith's departure from a performance of the stage show Funny Girl, which the theatre management said was due to ""technical difficulties"". She later pulled out of the show altogether due to mental health issues. In the ITV documentary, Smith said that after the Baftas she went back to her hotel room and she decided to stop taking the tablets she had been prescribed for her condition. It was only due to her friend unexpectedly coming to the hotel to see her that she was able to get help. ""It's a miracle she did (come). It's like someone was looking out for me because what I didn't realise is that if you stop these tablets abruptly, you seizure,"" said Smith. Sheridan Smith's fiance filmed her at home for ITV's Isolation Stories ""I seizured five times and got rushed to A&E and she's the one who got me breathing again."" Smith, who recently had her first child, told the programme that she now feels ""calm"" and ""contentment"". The actress had an emergency caesarean to deliver her son Billy early this summer, while the country was in lockdown. During that period she also made one of the short drama films for the ITV's Isolation Stories series. She played Mel, a heavily pregnant woman who faces having to go through birth without the married father of her child - who's chosen to stay with his wife and family. For the new documentary, cameras followed Smith as she attended her first scans, pre-natal classes and sessions with a specialist therapist, as well as at home with fiancÃ© Jamie Horn. Smith said she wanted to help other women who worry about their mental health issues resurfacing in pregnancy. ""The day he smiled at me was more amazing and emotional even than the day he was born, because you suddenly think, 'Oh my god - you love me back!',"" she said of her baby. ""Suddenly all those sleepless nights and all that worry goes out the window."" The documentary also sees the actress explore family issues that she feels could have affected her mental health, including the death of her brother when he was 18 and she was eight, and the death of her father in 2016. Over the past three years, Smith, who is also an Olivier Award-winning stage actress, has done more TV including BBC One's The Moorside and ITV's Cleaning Up. Last year she made a return to the West End as the narrator in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

"Kimberly Guilfoyle delivers a passionate convention speech The first night of the Republican National Convention was a two-and-a-half hour rebuttal to the accusations Democrats levelled at Donald Trump during the four nights of their convention last week. Did the president mishandle the coronavirus pandemic? The Republicans offered slick videos and first-hand accounts of the steps the president took to speed medical research, provide protective supplies and implement economic relief. Is the president inflaming racial divisions in the US? Former football star Herschel Walker spoke of his 37-year friendship with Mr Trump. Tim Scott, the first black Republican senator since the late 19th Century, touted the president's work on sentencing reform and tax breaks for economically distressed communities. Does the president lack empathy? Congressman Jim Jordan spoke of how Mr Trump offered sympathies when a relative died, and the president himself held a pre-taped White House forum where he offered words of support for coronavirus survivors and healthcare workers. Trump seeks to cast doubt on election integrity What to look for at Tuesday's convention What does Trump stand on the key issues? Polls suggest American voters have serious doubts about the president on all these issues - doubts that predated the Democratic convention attacks. Republicans have four days to assuage these concerns, chip away at Democratic opponent Joe Biden's lead and remind supporters what they like about Mr Trump's presidency. It's an imposing task, but the Republicans have identified what work has to be done. This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' But the success of the first night may hinge on what image viewers take away from it. Was it Mr Scott talking about his grandfather and how his family ""went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime""? Tim Scott is the only black Republican senator Or was it Republican activist Kimberly Guilfoyle shouting her speech, concluding with a call-out to ""leaders and fighters of liberty and freedom""? Clearly the two speeches were geared toward two different audiences - Ms Guilfoyle to rally the Trump faithful, and Mr Scott to reach out to suburban moderates concerned about the president's sometimes inflammatory language on racial issues. But they made for a jarring contrast. Mr Scott's speech, which capped the last hour of Monday night's convention was also, perhaps, the conclusion of the first trial heat of the 2024 Republican presidential nomination fight. There's been a lot of talk about how the Republican party could renounce Mr Trump if he were to lose in November, but the reality is the president has probably made a lasting mark on the party win or lose. The next nominee will probably be someone a lot more like the three final speakers of the evening - and they all acted like they were testing the political waters. Mr Scott introduced himself to Republicans, taking the first half of his speech to talk about his life and upbringing. Then there was his fellow South Carolinian, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who could run as a bridge between Trumpism and the more traditional Republicans who predated his rise. It's certainly the tone she struck in her speech. This video can not be played 'My father's entire worldview is that we can always do even better' But if Trump supporters in four years want more Trump, they might opt for the other featured speaker, Donald Trump Jr - who also happens to be Ms Guilfoyle's boyfriend. He offered a speech that was part populist red meat and part motivational sales pitch (""Imagine the life you want to have - one with a great job, a beautiful home, and a perfect family. You can have it!""). There are, of course, other Trumps scheduled to speak this week, with presidential daughter Ivanka getting a prime Thursday night slot before the president's address. And, of course, Vice-President Mike Pence has been positioning himself for a presidential run of his own practically since Trump named him as his running mate. He'll get to make his case to be the Trump torch-bearer on Wednesday night. It may just be under three months until the next presidential election, but it's less than three years until the next Republican presidential field takes shape.

"Pupils in Germany wearing face masks. But heads want clarification on wearing them in schools in England Head teachers have complained about a lack of clarity over the rules on whether teachers or pupils can wear face masks in schools in England. They want to know if they can override the official guidance which rejects the use of face coverings in school. ""The guidance is silent on what schools should do if staff or pupils want to wear face coverings,"" says Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union. A Downing Street spokesman ruled out any review on masks in school. InScotland's secondary schools, face coverings will be used in corridors and shared areas. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. But Mr Barton said it remained unclear whether schools in England could have flexibility to allow masks if they were requested as a safety measure by teachers or pupils' parents or where they might be seen as a ""useful additional measure"". A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school It comes as head teachers in England have written a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson,seen by the Guardian,,externalaccusing the government of failing to listen during the coronavirus crisis. The Worth Less? lobbying group, which says it represents thousands of head teachers, wrote that they felt they were ""working in isolation"" from the government as they faced ""some of the most important challenges of our professional lives"". ""Collaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by head teachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes,"" it said. Face masks for corridors in Scotland's secondary schools PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Medical adviser calls for return to school Jon Richards of Unison, representing support staff in schools, said masks were worn in other workplaces and it was ""vital"" that school staff should be allowed to wear them. Medical advisers at the weekend also highlightedthe risk of teachers spreading the virus to each other- rather than from pupil to pupil. The government's guidance, issued in early July, says Public Health Englanddoes not recommend using face coverings,externalin school. Schools are getting ready for reopening in September As pupils would be in their own separate ""bubbles"" there is no need for masks, says the guidance, which warned that ""misuse"" of face coverings could ""inadvertently increase the risk of transmission"". On Monday, a Downing Street spokesman said masks could get in the way of communication between teachers and pupils. Since the government guidance was published on returning safely to school on 2 July, the use of masks has become more widespread, for example, becoming compulsory in shops. ASCL said they had asked for further guidance on wearing masks more than a month ago. ""It would be helpful if the government could provide more advice on these complex issues but that has not been forthcoming,"" said Mr Barton. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have consistently followed Public Health England advice, which does not recommend the use of face coverings in schools because there are a range of protective measures in place, including children staying in consistent groups. ""We have set out the system of controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children in the coming weeks.""

"This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin There have been clashes for a second night in Wisconsin, with buildings and cars set alight, following the police shooting of a black man on Sunday. Jacob Blake, 29, is in a stable condition after he was shot several times as he went to a car and opened its door in the city of Kenosha. Governor Tony Evers has called up the National Guard to aid local police. The killing of black man George Floyd in Minnesota in May led to protests against racism and police brutality. Demonstrations across the US and in many cities internationally put a spotlight on the treatment of African-Americans by US law enforcement and prompted a wider reflection on racism in society. How are African Americans treated under the law? Five pieces of context to understand US protests Why do some protests turn violent? Video footage of the Kenosha shooting, taken from across the street and shared on social media, shows Mr Blake leaning into the car and an officer grabbing his shirt, with seven shots heard. A curfew has been in effect in Kenosha from 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT) until 07:00 on Tuesday - but has been defied by some protesters. This video can not be played Wisconsin's Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes says the shooting was ""familiar violence to too many of us"" The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Kenosha It had started out as an evening reminiscent of so many in towns and cities across the US after the killing of George Floyd, with hundreds of young people in Kenosha breaking a curfew to confront police lined up outside the courthouse. The demonstrators, here this time to call for justice for Jacob Blake, were initially pushed back and dispersed with strong tear gas and the use of sound bombs, but kept returning. Even now in the early hours of the morning they still face the officers in their riot shields. ""We're not leaving"", they chant. In the surrounding streets we saw vehicles set on fire, buildings vandalised and whole rows of streetlights pulled down. ""It is a breath of fresh air,"" one young protester told me. ""I am tired of being scared of the police killing me. Tonight they are going to listen."" Ina press release,external, Governor Evers said the ""limited mobilisation"" of the National Guard - made at the request of local officials - was to help law enforcement ""protect critical infrastructure"" and make sure people could demonstrate safely. He said he was deploying 125 members of the National Guard on Monday night. Earlier in the day some protesters tried to force their way into Kenosha's public safety building, demanding that the officers involved in the shooting be arrested. A door was broken off its hinges before officers in riot gear used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. At least one officer was injured in the neck by a firework, the New York Times reported. Buildings and cars were set alight in Kenosha Hundreds of people had also marched on police headquarters on Sunday night to demonstrate against the shooting. Governor Evers has condemned the shooting, saying Mr Blake was ""not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."" But the Democratic governor has faced criticism for this response. Pete Deates, head of Kenosha's police union, said Mr Evers' statement was ""wholly irresponsible"" and said people should wait until all facts were known. Many of the protesters were chanting ""Justice for Jacob"" Mr Evers has also said there will be a special session of the state legislature on 31 August to discuss a package of laws announced earlier this year on accountability and transparency of the police following the police killing of George Floyd. Lawmakers had ""failed to act"" in the two months since he announced the ""commonsense policies"", the governor tweeted. Demonstrations have also spread to other parts of the country, with disturbances reported as protesters marched through Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon. ""This is now a RIOT. Leave the area now,"" Portland Police tweeted as fires were being lit near the police building. Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday. It added that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. The person who shot the video, Raysean White, said that before he began taking it, he saw police wrestle with Mr Blake. He said police punched and Tasered Mr Blake. ""Jacob kind of leaned on the car and they proceeded to wrestle him toward the back of the car and he went to the other side,"" Mr White told CNN. It was then he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident The police said officers had been responding to a ""domestic incident"" but gave no details about what led to the shooting. They have not said how many officers were involved and no names have been given. Police in Kenosha do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Mr Blake's partner, Laquisha Booker, told a local NBC channel that the couple's three children were in the back of the vehicle at the time and saw the shooting. Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the families of George Floyd and others pursuing actions against the police, has announced he is representing Mr Blake's family. In a statement released on Twitter,externalhe said the 29-year-old father ""was helping to de-escalate a domestic incident"" at the time. Mr Crump said the officers' ""irresponsible, reckless and inhumane actions nearly cost the life of a man who was simply trying to do the right thing"". Mr Blake, who works as a security guard, is now out of surgery and improving.

"Causley has never revealed the whereabouts of his wife Carole Packman's body A man who killed his wife 35 years ago but has never revealed where he put her body must not be freed, his grandson has pleaded. Russell Causley killed Carole Packman in 1985 but evaded justice for a decade after faking his own death as part of an elaborate insurance scam. Causley, 78, has changed his account of the Bournemouth murder multiple times. Grandson Neil Gillingham urged the Parole Board, due to hear the killer's case for release, not to free him. Neil Gillingham said he believes his grandfather is still ""wicked and arrogant"" Mr Gillingham, the grandson of Mrs Packman and Causley, told the BBC his family has been ""tortured"" by the killer's continued refusal to reveal what he did with his victim's remains. The Parole Board will hear the case for Causley's release later and is expected to make public its decision in two weeks. Mr Gillingham urged the board to ""please encourage Russell to provide reassurance to us that he is indeed rehabilitated by allowing us to give Carole the burial any human following death, including Russell, rightfully deserves"". Causley initially denied the murder before later admitting to it while in prison and then retracting his confession. Mr Gillingham said Causley's efforts to continually change his story proved he was ""still wicked and arrogant"". Carole Packman disappeared in 1985 and her body has never been found Aviation engineer Causley moved his lover Patricia Causley - whose surname he took after they had an affair while he was married to Mrs Packman - into the family home on Ipswich Road, Bournemouth, in 1984. The day before her disappearance in 1985, Mrs Packman - then aged 40 - had visited a solicitor to inquire about a divorce. She was later reported missing by their teenage daughter Samantha, who had witnessed Causley physically and psychologically abusing her mother. However, Dorset Police reported that Mrs Packman had turned up at a police station to say she was safe and to stop searching for her. Detectives involved in the case have since admitted the force made a ""major mistake"" by not making basic identity checks and now believe the woman at the police station was not Mrs Packman. The case was then closed for nearly a decade, when Causley was caught trying to claim Â£790,000 in life insurance in 1993 afterfaking his own death on a boating trip. He was convicted of murder in 1996 before the conviction was quashed in 2003. A retrial the following year found him guilty again and he was jailed for life. ""We do not believe that his mentality has sufficiently changed as such that he will never be tempted to act or behave in the similar manner that imprisoned him all those years ago,"" said Mr Gillingham. ""We have a genuine fear that Russell Causley poses a significant risk to our family's safety."" He added: ""[Causley] should have been honest, he should've finally ended years of suffering and should have provided closure when that is the logical, human and decent thing to do given the serious nature of his offences and his continued plight for reintegration into society. ""Russell hasn't done any of this - he hasn't been honest, he hasn't ended years of suffering."" Following a hearing in 2018, the Parole Board recommended Causley be moved to an open prison but this was blocked by the justice secretary.

"Olga Freeman is accused of killing her son Dylan A woman admitted killing her severely disabled 10-year-old son in a call to her friend, an inquest has heard. Police discovered the body of Dylan Freeman, who had autism and Cohen syndrome at his home in Cumberland Park, Acton, on 16 August. West London Coroner's Court on Tuesday heard Dylan died after his airways had been restricted by a sponge. His mother and primary carer, Olga Freeman,appeared at the Old Baileylast week accused of his murder. Senior coroner Chinyere Inyama said doctors had recently prescribed Ms Freeman antidepressant tablets. Mr Inyama said: ""His mother called a friend in the early hours to state to the friend that she killed her son."" He said the mother and her friend went to Acton police station in west London and told them what had happened. The coroner said it appeared Dylan had been administered a sleeping aid. A sponge was then placed in his mouth, tied with a strap. The body of Dylan Freeman was found at a house in Cumberland Park, Acton Dylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities on many parts of the body - and other issues. Dylan's father, celebrity photographer Dean Freeman, last week described his son as ""a beautiful, bright, inquisitive and artistic child who loved to travel, visit art galleries and swim"". His body was identified four days later by his headteacher. Mr Inyama gave restriction of the airways as the preliminary cause of death. There was no other evidence of injuries caused by assault or restraint. Mr Inyama adjourned the inquest until March 2021, pending the outcome of any legal proceedings.

Here are some of the headlines from around the world from the day: The EU's trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations while in Ireland despite attending a golf dinner with 80 other guests. Phil Hogan has provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen after she requested further details about his trip home earlier this month. Mr Hogan was among the guests at a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In adocument published on the European Commission website,external, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August which he said ""ended the self-restriction period"". Mr Hogan told Irish broadcaster RTÃ: ""I am satisfied arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative that I was no risk to anybody."" The top doctor at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has apologised for overstating the benefits of patients blood plasma in the treatment of Covid-19. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn came under fire after his agency on Sunday gave emergency authorisation to use convalescent plasma on coronavirus patients. Echoing President Donald Trump, Mr Hahn touted the treatment as life-saving. But scientists quickly questioned the data provided by Mr Hahn, who suggested plasma could reduce deaths by 35% - a claim which grossly exaggerated preliminary findings from a clinic at the Mayo Clinic.

Speaking to Reuters news agency, he said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines.

It comes as US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA [emergency use authorisation] before you have a signal of efficacy,"" Dr Fauci said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial. ""To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. Read more on this story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Olga Freeman is accused of killing her son Dylan A woman admitted killing her severely disabled 10-year-old son in a call to her friend, an inquest has heard. Police discovered the body of Dylan Freeman, who had autism and Cohen syndrome at his home in Cumberland Park, Acton, on 16 August. West London Coroner's Court on Tuesday heard Dylan died after his airways had been restricted by a sponge. His mother and primary carer, Olga Freeman,appeared at the Old Baileylast week accused of his murder. Senior coroner Chinyere Inyama said doctors had recently prescribed Ms Freeman antidepressant tablets. Mr Inyama said: ""His mother called a friend in the early hours to state to the friend that she killed her son."" He said the mother and her friend went to Acton police station in west London and told them what had happened. The coroner said it appeared Dylan had been administered a sleeping aid. A sponge was then placed in his mouth, tied with a strap. The body of Dylan Freeman was found at a house in Cumberland Park, Acton Dylan had autism, Cohen syndrome - which is linked to abnormalities on many parts of the body - and other issues. Dylan's father, celebrity photographer Dean Freeman, last week described his son as ""a beautiful, bright, inquisitive and artistic child who loved to travel, visit art galleries and swim"". His body was identified four days later by his headteacher. Mr Inyama gave restriction of the airways as the preliminary cause of death. There was no other evidence of injuries caused by assault or restraint. Mr Inyama adjourned the inquest until March 2021, pending the outcome of any legal proceedings.

"Polio can only be prevented through immunisation Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission. Polio usually affects children under five, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected. Twenty-five years ago thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus. The disease is now only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago. The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process. Polio is a virus which spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system. Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday, Africa  has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus. More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio. Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa with 177 cases being identified this year. This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. The history of polio A polio vaccine was developed in 1952 Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine which has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world. In 1996 poliovirus paralysed more than 75,000 children across the continent - every country was affected. That year Nelson Mandela launched the ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines. It was backed by a coalition of groups including Rotary International which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s. Since 1996 billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus. What are vaccines and how do they work? The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns. Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio - in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north-east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016. At the time it was a frustrating set-back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified. Outside Nigeria, the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014. Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular. More than two million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities. Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts. In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations. Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year, but the rumours persisted. In 2013 nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano. It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine. Winning the trust of communities has been key. Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign. Misbahu Lawan Didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine ""Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'"" From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children. 'I opposed vaccinations until my son caught polio' Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five. Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised. Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations. This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001. The country remained free from polio for four years until 2005 when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country. The WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication. If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly. For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future.

The Ofqual board supports Sally in this decision, and thanks her for her leadership and service over the past four years, which has included overseeing the successful introduction of an entirely new set of GCSEs and A-levels, and a new grading system."" Roger Taylor remains the chair of the watchdog and a new committee of the Ofqual board is being formed to oversee its work until the end of the year. This will be led by Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman, who previously worked at Ofqual. ""Taken together these arrangements will ensure that Ofqual has the extra capacity, support and oversight it needs both to tackle the remaining issues from this year's awarding process and to ensure that next year's arrangements command public confidence,"" the statement said. Scientists believe they have traced the first UK coronavirus case to a woman in Nottinghamshire. Analysis of samples by the University of Nottingham showed a 75-year-old woman, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February. A Surrey resident waspreviously believedto have caught the virus first. The woman is also understood to be first in the UK to die after contracting Covid-19. News of the case has emerged only now, because samples were being analysed in retrospect by researchers as they investigated the origins of the UK pandemic. Read morehere. Five patients in a cancer ward at Craigavon Hospital in Northern Ireland havetested positive for Covid-19. Infection control experts have been at the hospital site today and families of the patients are being contacted by the Southern Health Trust, which runs the hospital. The ward has been closed to new admissions. A member of staff on the haematology ward is also affected and others have been sent home to self-isolate. It is the second confirmed outbreak at the hospital, with staff in the respiratory emergency department also testing positive. Cruises were abandoned in March as the coronavirus pandemic hit A cruise operator has extended a suspension of its services until March amid the coronavirus pandemic. It means Southampton-based Cunard, which is part of the Carnival group,will have paused operations for an entire year. Its three ships began to sail back to Southampton in March when it halted all of its cruises. Cunard president Simon Palethorpe said: ""We are so sorry to all those guests who were due to sail on any of the cancelled voyages and for the disappointment this news will cause. ""After very careful consideration and reviewing the latest guidance, we simply do not feel it would be sensible to start sailing again with our current schedule so we have reviewed future itineraries."" In May Carnival UK announcedplans to cut 450 jobsacross Cunard and P&O Cruises, to ""ensure the future sustainability"" of the business. ""Ghost"" cruise ships have become something of a tourist attraction as they stand anchored off the coast. Read morehere. Scotland is making it compulsory for school pupils to wear face coverings in communal areas from Monday â and there are signs that other parts of the UK may follow suit. But what do students think about it? The BBC visited a Scottish school where some students had voluntarily been wearing masks to find out. This video can not be played Coronavirus: High school pupils in Scotland to wear face coverings Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US virus expert, has warned against rushing out a Covid-19 vaccine before it has been proven to be safe and effective. Speaking to Reuters news agency, he said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines.

It comes as US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA [emergency use authorisation] before you have a signal of efficacy,"" Dr Fauci said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial. ""To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. Read more on this story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"On the first night of the Republican Party convention, the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, took centre stage and commanded the nation's attention. ""Trump's policies have been like rocket fuel to the economy,"" Mr Trump said during his speech, praising his father's leadership. But his most powerful lines were not about the president; they were swipes at Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for the presidency. ""Biden's radical left-wing policies would stop our economic recovery cold,"" Mr Trump said. He warned conservatives that Democrats would undo the economic gains that people had made with his father in the White House. ""Biden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it in the Swamp,"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""That makes sense, considering Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp. For the past half-century, he's been lurking around in there."" This video can not be played 'My father's entire worldview is that we can always do even better' A fierce advocate for his father's platform, Donald Trump Jr's supporters say he can electrify a room while his detractors accuse him of pouring petrol on the flames. His presentations are laced with full-throated attacks on liberals, Hunter Biden - Joe Biden's son - and on the media (that's when the crowd roars). Firebrand speaker, sportsman and big-game hunter, Mr Trump is doing everything he can to help his father win re-election. The Republican strategy has focused on energising the president's base of supporters, and they see the younger Mr Trump as their ace in the hole. Trump family dominate convention schedule He has an unusual rapport with the president's supporters, many of whom live in rural parts of the country and also love to hunt. ""He's viewed as a conduit to the Trump base,"" explains Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. They like his ""no-nonsense"" style, says Michael Kuckelman, the chair of the Kansas Republican Party who is now at the Charlotte convention. Many of the president's base like the way that the younger Mr Trump has at times gone even further than his father, supporting, for example, the gun industry's efforts to have restrictions on silencers eliminated. He is also admired for his boldness - he has aligned himself with colourful characters. Last year, he appeared at a rally for We Build the Wall, a group that was founded as a way to raise funds for the wall. Founders of the group have recently been charged with defrauding donors. Mr Trump campaigns for his father at a gun store in Maine in 2016 In his role as a campaign speaker, Mr Trump is often surrounded by signs emblazoned with his father's name. In these moments, his part seems preordained: when you have the same name as your father, it is natural to slip into the role of cheerleader. And while some men might chafe at the part, he has thrived in his father's shadow. He is treated like a rock star at conservative venues. Lawrence Levy, the executive dean of Hofstra University's National Center for Suburban Studies, says that Mr Trump is an unusually effective advocate for his father on the campaign trail. And it could be a stepping stone to a more prominent role. ""The successful sons of powerful people learn not just to live but to thrive in what may seem like their father's shadow but will someday disappear and they will be the family's patriarch,"" says Mr Levy. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes In the meantime, he is in many ways similar to his father and is just as divisive as the president. While the president's supporters cheer him on, liberals recoil. ""A product of nepotism,"" says Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University. Jon Reinish, a New York-based Democratic strategist, says that he taps into dark strands of the current presidency, describing him as a ""younger, more acidic version of his father"". Says Mr Reinish: ""Donald Jr is the gasoline on the fire."" A bearded man with short-cropped hair, Mr Trump wears open-collar shirts and throws his hands around when he talks. During his speeches, he bounces on his feet like a boxer in the ring. ""He energises and electrifies a room,"" says Jack Oliver, a Republican fund-raiser. ""He has a radiant personality."" Mr Trump spent his childhood summers in Czechoslovakia, as it was then known, hunting with his paternal grandfather, and had a rowdy youth. In his early twenties, he was arrested in New Orleans on charges of public drunkenness and thrown in jail. He and his ex-wife, Vanessa Haydon, a former model, have five children. His current girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, is a fund-raising official for the campaign (she calls him ""Junior Mint"", an affectionate term). Kimberly Guilfoyle is also speaking at the RNC He became a lightning rod for controversy because of a meeting in New York that he had with a Russian lawyer, a woman with ties to the Kremlin, in June 2016. The meeting was scrutinised by special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into ties between the campaign and Russia that summer. But in the end, Mr Mueller said there was not sufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy. His father acted protectively of his son and downplayed the significance of it. ""He had a meeting. Nothing happened with the meeting,"" the president told me and other reporters on Air Force One in the summer of 2017. The president spoke of his son, an executive for the Trump Organization, as if he were much younger. ""He's a good boy,"" said the president. ""He's a good kid."" Lately both men have focused like a laser on the polls in November. Their future hang in the balance. Why Trump Jr Skittles tweet sparked storm As Hofstra University's Lawrence Levy explains, the younger man's prospects may be enhanced by the results on election day. ""He's positioning himself to be the financial and political heir to the Trump brand and what he chooses to do with that will depend on how successful this campaign will be."" Mr Levy says that he could go far. ""The base is wild for him. He is very popular in red states. If for some reason he only wanted to become a member of Congress, he could run very successfully,"" he says. ""But I think his ambitions are bigger than that."" His chances for future success will be higher if he can help win this one for his father. From now until November, they both have their eyes on the prize.

Warnings are in place for rain and wind across the UK, with more than 80mm of rainfall in the Lake District. Emergency services have urged the public to take extra care in the stormy conditions across the UK, particularly along the coast. Storm Francis in pictures Wales: Strong winds damage property amid flooding chaos Elderly NI residents evacuated from homes Camping teens rescued from 'raging torrent' As of 13:00 BST, wind gusts of 78mph had been recorded at the Needles, on the Isle of Wight, and 63mph at Mumbles, on the Gower Peninsula, according to BBC Weather. Several places in England and Wales have provisionally recorded their highest ever gusts of wind in August - including 68mph at Pembrey Sands, 52mph at Shobdon in Herefordshire, and 49mph at Pershore in Worcestershire. The Met Office said the Environment Agency had so far recorded 86mm of rain in the Lake District and 74mm of rain in Mid Glamorgan.

He added: ""This weather in August doesn't reassure us when our area is prone to flooding in winter, so the fact that we're dealing with this now shows that climate change should be taken seriously."" Heavy downpours have also caused disruption across Northern Ireland, where motorists were urged to seek alternative routes afterthe Shimna River burst its banksin County Down. Bridges were destroyed by flooding from the Shimna River in County Down There were also road closures elsewhere in the UK and some trains were cancelled or delayed due to flooding. Network Rail saidspeed restrictions were in place,externalon several rail routes across the UK. Avanti West Coast, Northern, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales are currently disrupted due to weather related issues, it said. On Tuesday, Network Rail acknowledged that it needs to better understand the risks of extreme weather following the train that derailed in Aberdeenshire earlier this month, killing three people. The public company, which manages the UK's railways, has asked world-renowned meteorologist Dame Julia Slingo to lead a task force which will aim to improve the company's forecasting of extreme weather and its impact on rail infrastructure. The company has also tasked Lord Robert Mair, a leading engineer, to spearhead a separate task force which will look at how Network Rail can improve its management of earthworks - for example embankments or when part of the land is excavated to make space for the railway. Meanwhile, the M48 Severn Bridge is closed in both directions between junctions one and two due to strong winds in the area, Highways England said. A DFDS ferry arrives in bad weather at the Port of Dover in Kent Three Met Office yellow weather warnings for rain and wind cover most of the UK on Tuesday, with stormy conditions expected to last until 06:00 BST on Wednesday. Rain warnings cover Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, northern England and parts of north Wales until Wednesday morning. Flood alerts, telling people to be prepared, have been issued for parts of the west Midlands and north west of England. Windsurfers were out at Westward Ho! in Devon, despite warnings of 70mph winds Storm Francis comes on the back of Ellen which struck last week and caused power outages. It marks the first time the Met Office has had two named storms in August since it started the process in 2015. Forecasters said the winds were ""unusual"" for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of 87mph recorded at The Needles in August 1996. Likewise, the wettest August on record in the UK was in 1912 when 167.3mm was recorded across the country as a whole. Between 1 and 22 August, the UK as a whole had seen some 72.7mm of rainfall - around four-fifths of the average rainfall for the month. No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next storm will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on 1 September. Have you been affected by Storm Francis?

"Sheridan Smith says she had become addicted to her anxiety medication Sheridan Smith has revealed she was rushed to hospital and had five seizures after she stopped taking anti-anxiety medication. Smith said she ""went off the deep end"" after the 2016 TV Bafta Awards ceremony, where she was nominated for her performance in The C Word. She was left ""humiliated"" by jokes made by the host Graham Norton about her ""being a drunk"", she said. She then stopped her medication that night, not realising it was dangerous. BBC News has asked Norton's representatives for a comment. The Cilla and Gavin and Stacey star, made the revelations in a forthcoming ITV special documentary called Sheridan Smith: Becoming Mum, which tells the story of her mental health struggles and her journey to motherhood. In the film, she recalled: ""Graham Norton was hosting and made a joke, basically at my expense, about me being a drunk. Bafta TV Awards host Graham Norton suggested Sheridan Smith was drunk at the ceremony ""I was so humiliated, you know, it's a room full of your peers. And people you want to work with, or have worked with. ""That night, for me, was like the final straw before my brain totally went off the deep end. ""What people didn't realise is that I'd become addicted to anti-anxiety tablets."" During the Bafta ceremony, Norton said: ""We're all excited for a couple of drinks tonight. Or, as it's known in theatrical circles, a few glasses of technical difficulties."" The comment was a reference to Smith's departure from a performance of the stage show Funny Girl, which the theatre management said was due to ""technical difficulties"". She later pulled out of the show altogether due to mental health issues. In the ITV documentary, Smith said that after the Baftas she went back to her hotel room and she decided to stop taking the tablets she had been prescribed for her condition. It was only due to her friend unexpectedly coming to the hotel to see her that she was able to get help. ""It's a miracle she did (come). It's like someone was looking out for me because what I didn't realise is that if you stop these tablets abruptly, you seizure,"" said Smith. Sheridan Smith's fiance filmed her at home for ITV's Isolation Stories ""I seizured five times and got rushed to A&E and she's the one who got me breathing again."" Smith, who recently had her first child, told the programme that she now feels ""calm"" and ""contentment"". The actress had an emergency caesarean to deliver her son Billy early this summer, while the country was in lockdown. During that period she also made one of the short drama films for the ITV's Isolation Stories series. She played Mel, a heavily pregnant woman who faces having to go through birth without the married father of her child - who's chosen to stay with his wife and family. For the new documentary, cameras followed Smith as she attended her first scans, pre-natal classes and sessions with a specialist therapist, as well as at home with fiancÃ© Jamie Horn. Smith said she wanted to help other women who worry about their mental health issues resurfacing in pregnancy. ""The day he smiled at me was more amazing and emotional even than the day he was born, because you suddenly think, 'Oh my god - you love me back!',"" she said of her baby. ""Suddenly all those sleepless nights and all that worry goes out the window."" The documentary also sees the actress explore family issues that she feels could have affected her mental health, including the death of her brother when he was 18 and she was eight, and the death of her father in 2016. Over the past three years, Smith, who is also an Olivier Award-winning stage actress, has done more TV including BBC One's The Moorside and ITV's Cleaning Up. Last year she made a return to the West End as the narrator in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

"Virgin Atlantic is awaiting the outcome of a key vote on a restructuring plan which is seen as vital to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis. The airline agreed the Â£1.2bn rescue deal in July, but this has to be agreed by creditors. The firm is ""fundamentally sound"" but a restructuring and fresh cash injection is critical, its lawyers have said. It has warned thatit could run out of cash by the end of Septemberif the plan is not approved. The deal involves Â£400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The rest will come from investors and creditors, who now have to give their approval. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways owner IAG who now runs his own aviation consultancy, told the BBC that for the deal to go ahead, Virgin Atlantic's unsecured creditors had to agree for their repayments to be rescheduled. He said they were being asked to accept 20% less than they were owed, with the rest to be repaid over two years. Mr Boyle said the extra cash ""doesn't seem like enough to me"", given that Sir Richard had asked the government for Â£500m and had his request rejected.

"Virgin Atlantic is awaiting the outcome of a key vote on a restructuring plan which is seen as vital to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis. The airline agreed the Â£1.2bn rescue deal in July, but this has to be agreed by creditors. The firm is ""fundamentally sound"" but a restructuring and fresh cash injection is critical, its lawyers have said. It has warned thatit could run out of cash by the end of Septemberif the plan is not approved. The deal involves Â£400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The rest will come from investors and creditors, who now have to give their approval. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways owner IAG who now runs his own aviation consultancy, told the BBC that for the deal to go ahead, Virgin Atlantic's unsecured creditors had to agree for their repayments to be rescheduled. He said they were being asked to accept 20% less than they were owed, with the rest to be repaid over two years. Mr Boyle said the extra cash ""doesn't seem like enough to me"", given that Sir Richard had asked the government for Â£500m and had his request rejected. ""It will get them through maybe the next six months, when they might be in a better position to ask for more money from somewhere,"" he added. Apart from Virgin Group, Virgin Atlantic's other main shareholder is US airline Delta, which owns 49% of the airline.

"Polio can only be prevented through immunisation Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission. Polio usually affects children under five, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected. Twenty-five years ago thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus. The disease is now only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago. The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process. Polio is a virus which spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system. Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday, Africa  has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus. More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio. Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa with 177 cases being identified this year. This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. The history of polio A polio vaccine was developed in 1952 Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine which has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world. In 1996 poliovirus paralysed more than 75,000 children across the continent - every country was affected. That year Nelson Mandela launched the ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines. It was backed by a coalition of groups including Rotary International which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s. Since 1996 billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus. What are vaccines and how do they work? The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns. Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio - in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north-east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016. At the time it was a frustrating set-back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified. Outside Nigeria, the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014. Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular. More than two million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities. Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts. In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations. Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year, but the rumours persisted. In 2013 nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano. It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine. Winning the trust of communities has been key. Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign. Misbahu Lawan Didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine ""Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'"" From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children. 'I opposed vaccinations until my son caught polio' Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five. Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised. Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations. This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001. The country remained free from polio for four years until 2005 when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country. The WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication. If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly. For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future.

"While mums-to-be and women trying for a baby should limit their caffeine intake, a couple of cups of tea or coffee a day is fine, say experts. Their comments come as anew research paper,externalin a medical journal suggests there is no safe level in pregnancy. But the experts say that is alarmist. The NHS and many other organisations say consuming 200mg or less a day should not pose any significant risk in terms of miscarriage or growth of the baby while in the womb. The stillbirth charity Tommy's has acaffeine intake calculator,externalto help women keep track of their consumption. The controversial research paper, published in BMJ Evidence Based Medicine, looked at 48 studies on the topic. The author of that paper, Prof Jack James, a psychologist at Reykjavik University in Iceland, acknowledges that the work is observational, so can't prove definitively that any caffeine in pregnancy is harmful. But he says his analysis, which links caffeine with harm, suggests avoiding drinks like tea and coffee entirely would be the best advice for mums-to-be and women trying to get pregnant. Other experts strongly disagree, saying this is overkill. Just as the NHS does, the European Food Safety Authority and the American and UK Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend limiting, but not eliminating, caffeine consumption during pregnancy. Dr Luke Grzeskowiak, a pharmacist at the University of Adelaide, Australia, said the research paper was ""overly alarmist"" and inconsistent with accepted evidence. ""There are so many dos and don'ts associated with pregnancy and the last thing we need is to cause unnecessary anxiety. At the end of the day, women should be reassured that caffeine can be consumed in moderation during pregnancy."" Prof Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at Kings College London, said some of the studies in the analysis may be flawed because they rely on women recalling caffeine intake. Also, he said, it is difficult to exclude other risk factors that tea or coffee drinkers might be indulging in, such as cigarette smoking. He said: ""Caffeine has been in human diets for a long time. ""Like many substances found in a normal diet, harms in pregnancy can be found with high doses. ""However the observational nature of this data with its inherent bias does not indicate with any certainty that low doses of caffeine are harmful, and the current advice to avoid high doses of caffeine are unlikely to change.""

"The president has publicly criticised Dr Fauci in the past The top US virus expert has warned against rushing out a Covid-19 vaccine before it has been proven to be safe and effective. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Dr Anthony Fauci also said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines. US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. Such a move could boost his chances of re-election in November's presidential election. Democrats accuse the US president of being prepared to endanger American lives for political gain. On Saturday, President Trump tweeted that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines"". The Financial Times reported the Trump administrationwas exploring granting emergency use authorisation (EUA) to a vaccine currently under development,externalby the University of Oxford and drug manufacturer AstraZeneca. Some 10,000 people have volunteered for trials of the drug, but US agencies require trials involving 30,000 people for a vaccine to be authorised. The week when everything changed for Trump Does the US have the worst coronavirus death rate? The US has suffered more confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus than any other country. According to Johns Hopkins University, it has recorded more than 5.7 million infections and over 177,000 deaths so far. Inan interview with Reuters,external, Dr Fauci - head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - warned rushing out an untested vaccine could damage other trials. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA before you have a signal of efficacy,"" he said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial."" ""To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? The Oxford vaccine is one of dozens currently under development around the world. Major pharmaceutical companies have launched huge trials to test the effectiveness of their drugs in recent weeks. Previously the FDA issued an EUA for the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus. Butin July officials withdrew the EUA, saying clinical studies suggested the anti-malaria drug was ineffective in treating the deadly virus and failed to prevent infection among those exposed to it. Mr Trump has touted the benefits of the medicine, directly contradicting the advice of his medical experts.

"Face coverings will only be required in corridors, communal areas and on buses Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday. Education Secretary John Swinney said the new rules would apply to all pupils aged over 12. He saidthe guidance,externalhad been updated based onnew advice from the World Health Organization(WHO). There will be no requirement to wear face coverings in classrooms where distancing measures are in place. Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? WHO says children over 12 should wear masks Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? Mr Swinney said individual exemptions could be granted for health reasons, but the guidance would be ""obligatory"" for all secondary, special and grant-aided schools. He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""From August 31st young people over the age of 12 in secondary schools should habitually be wearing face coverings when they are moving around schools and corridors and in communal areas where it is difficult to deliver the physical distancing."" He said the Scottish government had acted in the light of the new WHO advice based on evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults, but had decided to go further by extending it to school transport. ""It's part of the general measures we are taking to ensure we keep pace with the emerging advice about how to keep our schools open and to keep our schools safe,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signalled on Monday that a change in the guidance was imminent. The new rules for school buses will apply to pupils over the age of five, in line with guidelines for public transport. Staff and students can continue to wear face coverings in all settings voluntarily if they wish. Eileen Prior, executive director of the parents' organisation Connect, formerly known as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, earlier said she hoped schools would be offered some flexibility over how the new guidance was implemented. She said: ""In some schools it won't be necessary - it depends very much on the environment within a school. ""Some schools are incredibly crowded but some simply aren't and some are well below capacity, perhaps with wide corridors and they don't have the issue that we have in many high schools of young people just crowding because they just can't not crowd."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âIf we need to change the advice then of course we willâ But Mr Swinney said while the new rules were not mandatory, they had the same status as other guidance on reopening of schools, such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, and should be considered ""obligatory"" across the secondary sector. ""There will be exemptions from this because the wearing of face coverings is not suitable for all individuals and that has to be respected,"" he said. He also stressed that an individual pupil should not be excluded from a school because they were not wearing a face covering. The UK government has said there are ""no plans"" to introduce similar measures when schools return in England after the summer break. Head teachers, however,have complained about a lack of clarityand asked whether English schools would have the flexibility to allow masks if requested as a safety measure by teachers. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the revised guidance in Scotland was a sensible move. She said: ""The schools have done brilliantly well getting going again but I think their physical distancing in some of the communal areas is always going to be a bit of a challenge to enforce... when we've still got cases circulating in the community this will provide additional protection when it's difficult to physically distance."" She said there may be more work to do to educate young people about the correct way to put on or remove a face covering. ""Not touching the surface - taking it off around the ears. I would recommend young people might carry a little bag in their pocket, stick the face covering in there and when they're taking it off and when they're putting it back on, making sure they don't touch the front of it,"" she said. ""And then of course there's the cleaning issue - these coverings need to be washed, just in warm water and soap."" The interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the education advisory group had considered carefully whether poor hygiene while using masks might spread the virus. ""In their consideration they looked at the evidence from infection from removing masks, on and off, and whether that was likely to play a significant component in terms of introducing an increased risk of transmission,"" he said. ""On balance, their assessment of that evidence was that there was insufficient evidence to support that view."" The EIS teaching union welcomed the announcement as a ""sensible and appropriate step"" but repeated its call for investment in more teaching staff to allow smaller class sizes. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""There needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Causley has never revealed the whereabouts of his wife Carole Packman's body A man who killed his wife 35 years ago but has never revealed where he put her body must not be freed, his grandson has pleaded. Russell Causley killed Carole Packman in 1985 but evaded justice for a decade after faking his own death as part of an elaborate insurance scam. Causley, 78, has changed his account of the Bournemouth murder multiple times. Grandson Neil Gillingham urged the Parole Board, due to hear the killer's case for release, not to free him. Neil Gillingham said he believes his grandfather is still ""wicked and arrogant"" Mr Gillingham, the grandson of Mrs Packman and Causley, told the BBC his family has been ""tortured"" by the killer's continued refusal to reveal what he did with his victim's remains. The Parole Board will hear the case for Causley's release later and is expected to make public its decision in two weeks. Mr Gillingham urged the board to ""please encourage Russell to provide reassurance to us that he is indeed rehabilitated by allowing us to give Carole the burial any human following death, including Russell, rightfully deserves"". Causley initially denied the murder before later admitting to it while in prison and then retracting his confession. Mr Gillingham said Causley's efforts to continually change his story proved he was ""still wicked and arrogant"". Carole Packman disappeared in 1985 and her body has never been found Aviation engineer Causley moved his lover Patricia Causley - whose surname he took after they had an affair while he was married to Mrs Packman - into the family home on Ipswich Road, Bournemouth, in 1984. The day before her disappearance in 1985, Mrs Packman - then aged 40 - had visited a solicitor to inquire about a divorce. She was later reported missing by their teenage daughter Samantha, who had witnessed Causley physically and psychologically abusing her mother. However, Dorset Police reported that Mrs Packman had turned up at a police station to say she was safe and to stop searching for her. Detectives involved in the case have since admitted the force made a ""major mistake"" by not making basic identity checks and now believe the woman at the police station was not Mrs Packman. The case was then closed for nearly a decade, when Causley was caught trying to claim Â£790,000 in life insurance in 1993 afterfaking his own death on a boating trip. He was convicted of murder in 1996 before the conviction was quashed in 2003. A retrial the following year found him guilty again and he was jailed for life. ""We do not believe that his mentality has sufficiently changed as such that he will never be tempted to act or behave in the similar manner that imprisoned him all those years ago,"" said Mr Gillingham. ""We have a genuine fear that Russell Causley poses a significant risk to our family's safety."" He added: ""[Causley] should have been honest, he should've finally ended years of suffering and should have provided closure when that is the logical, human and decent thing to do given the serious nature of his offences and his continued plight for reintegration into society. ""Russell hasn't done any of this - he hasn't been honest, he hasn't ended years of suffering."" Following a hearing in 2018, the Parole Board recommended Causley be moved to an open prison but this was blocked by the justice secretary.

"About half the schools in Leicestershire will reopen on Wednesday Some parents, especially those shielding, have said they are scared to send their children back ahead of England's first schools reopening. Leicester and Leicestershire pupils will be among the earliest in the country to return on Wednesday. The government has saidit is unlikely children will pass coronavirus on to others or get seriously ill from it. A number of parents in the city fear they are putting themselves at risk by sending their children back. Unlike other areas of England, schools in Leicester and Leicestershire traditionally break up for summer holidays a week earlier than other local authorities. As a result, pupils return to school a week earlier. Andrea Burford, a 45-year-old mother of two who suffers from asthma and other health conditions, must continue to shield until 7 Septemberbecause of Leicester's high level of coronavirus infections. But her daughter is due to start secondary school on Friday. Andrea Burford said she wants her daughter back at school ""but I also want it to be safe"" Mrs Burford said: ""How can I send her back while I'm still expected to shield? ""I don't believe [children] can't transmit it. I want her back at school but I also want it to be safe."" The government is urging parents to send their children back, and there could be fines for those who do not. The UK's chief medical adviser Chris Whitty has said ""the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are incredibly small"" and missing lessons ""damages children in the long-run"". He admitted there were ""no risk-free"" options but said children were ""much less likely"" to spread the disease. Protective measures like distancing, hand washing and cleaning can reduce risks, Prof Whitty said But another parent, who wished to be known only as Alex, said he was ""genuinely scared"" his daughter could bring the virus home. The 38-year-old suffered two heart attacks last September and has been shielding throughout the pandemic. Now his daughter is set to return to school to start Year 7. He said: ""I'm petrified. I keep getting all these shielding letters from the government but at the same time they're forcing me to send my child to school. ""We've been following the rules to a T, but now we have no choice but to send her out."" Leicester City Council said it would only pursue fines as a last resort but added returning to school was ""vital"" for a child's education and wellbeing. The authority added: ""We understand some parents may have concerns about their children returning to school. ""We are working closely with education settings to make sure arrangements are being put in place to minimise the risk of transmission for all."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when?

"Polio can only be prevented through immunisation Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission. Polio usually affects children under five, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected. Twenty-five years ago thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus. The disease is now only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago. The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process. Polio is a virus which spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system. Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday, Africa  has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus. More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio. Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa with 177 cases being identified this year. This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. The history of polio A polio vaccine was developed in 1952 Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine which has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world. In 1996 poliovirus paralysed more than 75,000 children across the continent - every country was affected. That year Nelson Mandela launched the ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines. It was backed by a coalition of groups including Rotary International which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s. Since 1996 billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus. What are vaccines and how do they work? The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns. Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio - in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north-east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016. At the time it was a frustrating set-back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified. Outside Nigeria, the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014. Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular. More than two million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities. Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts. In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations. Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year, but the rumours persisted. In 2013 nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano. It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine. Winning the trust of communities has been key. Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign. Misbahu Lawan Didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine ""Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'"" From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children. 'I opposed vaccinations until my son caught polio' Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five. Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised. Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations. This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001. The country remained free from polio for four years until 2005 when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country. The WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication. If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly. For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn came under fire after his agency on Sunday gave emergency authorisation to use convalescent plasma on coronavirus patients. Echoing President Donald Trump, Mr Hahn touted the treatment as life-saving. But scientists quickly questioned the data provided by Mr Hahn, who suggested plasma could reduce deaths by 35% - a claim which grossly exaggerated preliminary findings from a clinic at the Mayo Clinic. Mr Hahn told CBS News he could have ""done a better job"" of explaining what the data shows. He maintained that the decision to authorise the treatment for emergency use was made by FDA career scientists, ""based upon sound science and data"". Mr Hahn has faced criticism for appearing to play politics, backing the Trump administration amid its push for a breakthrough treatment of Covid-19 in the run-up to the presidential election on 3 November. The plasma announcement came a day after Mr Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons. Read the full storyhere. The Netherlands has seen a slight drop in the number of coronavirus cases in the past week - down by 425 from 4,013 to 3,588 compared with the previous week, according to the RIVM public health institute. But a quarter of new cases involved people
who had returned from abroad. Some 867 who returned tested positive in the past week, mainly from France (161) and Spain (278), Dutch media report. Meanwhile, hospital admissions in the country have gone up sharply, from 50 last week to 84 in the past seven days, Dutch media report. The number of deaths has also doubled from 16 to 32. At the beginning of the month, PM Mark Rutte said the virus was rising at a dangerous rate. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external, the Netherlands still has among the highest infection rates in Europe per 100,000 people (currently 45), reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.  A further 16 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days of dying have been recorded in the UK. It takes the total number of deaths which have been linked to coronavirus in the country to 41,449. There were a further 1,184 new cases reported in the previous 24 hours, official figures showed on Tuesday. It takes total cases to 327,798. Mexico City's famous ""floating gardens"" which had been closed to tourists because of the pandemic have now reopened after a five-month coronavirus shutdown. They feature the city's iconic trajineras boats which can be found at the Nativitas canal pier in Xochimilco, in a network of canals and floating gardens, originally built by the Aztecs.  The boats were thoroughly disinfected ahead of reopening to visitors at the weekend. But coronavirus restrictions mean numbers are now limited and face masks are compulsory. Mexico has been hit hard by the pandemic,recording the world's third highest death toll. It has more than 560,000 cases of the virus and more than 60,000 deaths. Some 3,700 Swedes were told they had Covid, butit then turned out the results were wrong,external. Sweden's Public Health Agency said on Tuesday that faulty PCR test kits had returned some 3,700 false positive results back in March. Mostly ""people who had mild symptoms or who didn't feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results"", the agency said in a statement. The agency added it would contact those affected this week and adjust Sweden's official number of cases. The error was discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls.

"The president has publicly criticised Dr Fauci in the past The top US virus expert has warned against rushing out a Covid-19 vaccine before it has been proven to be safe and effective. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Dr Anthony Fauci also said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines. US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. Such a move could boost his chances of re-election in November's presidential election. Democrats accuse the US president of being prepared to endanger American lives for political gain. On Saturday, President Trump tweeted that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines"". The Financial Times reported the Trump administrationwas exploring granting emergency use authorisation (EUA) to a vaccine currently under development,externalby the University of Oxford and drug manufacturer AstraZeneca. Some 10,000 people have volunteered for trials of the drug, but US agencies require trials involving 30,000 people for a vaccine to be authorised.

According to Johns Hopkins University, it has recorded more than 5.7 million infections and over 177,000 deaths so far. Inan interview with Reuters,external, Dr Fauci - head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - warned rushing out an untested vaccine could damage other trials.

"Thousands of patients are likely to have been infected with coronavirus in UK hospitals, a study suggests. The King's College London study of 10 UK hospital sites plus one in Italy found at least one in eight patients who had received hospital treatment for coronavirus had caught it on-site. Researchers said that was a relatively low rate and showed there was effective infection control in place. They analysed data on 1,500 cases to 28 April, covering the peak in the UK. Lead author Dr Ben Carter said: ""The majority of these patients had already been in hospital for a long time. ""They were older, frailer and had pre-existing health conditions."" But they also had better outcomes than those admitted with the virus, probably because of faster diagnosis and, therefore, treatment. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Only those who tested positive 15 days or more after admission were counted as hospital-acquired infections, however. And if patients who tested positive after five to 14 days are included, the proportion increases to 23%. But, because of the long incubation period of the virus, it is impossible to be sure how many of these patients would have been infected in hospital. Prof Duncan Young, an expert in intensive-care medicine at Oxford University, said the study would also not have captured those infected during a short hospital stay, as patients were not followed up after discharge. And of course the study only looked at people who were being treated in hospital for coronavirus, so did not include the vast majority of people who caught the disease and either showed no illness or just recovered at home with no need for treatment. Those caveats do suggest the the risk of catching the virus in hospital remains still small.

Thechief regulator of exams watchdog Ofqual has resignedfollowing the chaos which surrounded this year's A-level, GCSE and BTec results. Sally Collier quit after thousands of students were downgraded by a computer algorithm, which led to accusations of pupils in more deprived areas being treated unfairly. It also led to many A-level students losing university places they had been offered, and a crunch on degree places. In other news: We'll be bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the world from the day: The EU's trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations while in Ireland despite attending a golf dinner with 80 other guests. Phil Hogan has provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen after she requested further details about his trip home earlier this month. Mr Hogan was among the guests at a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In adocument published on the European Commission website,external, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August which he said ""ended the self-restriction period"". Mr Hogan told Irish broadcaster RTÃ: ""I am satisfied arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative that I was no risk to anybody."" The top doctor at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has apologised for overstating the benefits of patients blood plasma in the treatment of Covid-19. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn came under fire after his agency on Sunday gave emergency authorisation to use convalescent plasma on coronavirus patients. Echoing President Donald Trump, Mr Hahn touted the treatment as life-saving. But scientists quickly questioned the data provided by Mr Hahn, who suggested plasma could reduce deaths by 35% - a claim which grossly exaggerated preliminary findings from a clinic at the Mayo Clinic. Mr Hahn told CBS News he could have ""done a better job"" of explaining what the data shows. He maintained that the decision to authorise the treatment for emergency use was made by FDA career scientists, ""based upon sound science and data"". Mr Hahn has faced criticism for appearing to play politics, backing the Trump administration amid its push for a breakthrough treatment of Covid-19 in the run-up to the presidential election on 3 November. The plasma announcement came a day after Mr Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons. Read the full storyhere. The Netherlands has seen a slight drop in the number of coronavirus cases in the past week - down by 425 from 4,013 to 3,588 compared with the previous week, according to the RIVM public health institute. But a quarter of new cases involved people
who had returned from abroad. Some 867 who returned tested positive in the past week, mainly from France (161) and Spain (278), Dutch media report. Meanwhile, hospital admissions in the country have gone up sharply, from 50 last week to 84 in the past seven days, Dutch media report. The number of deaths has also doubled from 16 to 32. At the beginning of the month, PM Mark Rutte said the virus was rising at a dangerous rate. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external, the Netherlands still has among the highest infection rates in Europe per 100,000 people (currently 45), reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.  A further 16 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days of dying have been recorded in the UK. It takes the total number of deaths which have been linked to coronavirus in the country to 41,449. There were a further 1,184 new cases reported in the previous 24 hours, official figures showed on Tuesday. It takes total cases to 327,798. Mexico City's famous ""floating gardens"" which had been closed to tourists because of the pandemic have now reopened after a five-month coronavirus shutdown. They feature the city's iconic trajineras boats which can be found at the Nativitas canal pier in Xochimilco, in a network of canals and floating gardens, originally built by the Aztecs.  The boats were thoroughly disinfected ahead of reopening to visitors at the weekend. But coronavirus restrictions mean numbers are now limited and face masks are compulsory. Mexico has been hit hard by the pandemic,recording the world's third highest death toll. It has more than 560,000 cases of the virus and more than 60,000 deaths. Some 3,700 Swedes were told they had Covid, butit then turned out the results were wrong,external. Sweden's Public Health Agency said on Tuesday that faulty PCR test kits had returned some 3,700 false positive results back in March. Mostly ""people who had mild symptoms or who didn't feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results"", the agency said in a statement. The agency added it would contact those affected this week and adjust Sweden's official number of cases. The error was discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls. The agency said the kits were made by a company in China and had been distributed worldwide. It says it has alerted the World Health Organization.  Virgin Atlantic has won backing from its creditors for a Â£1.2bn rescue planthat will secure its future for at least the next 18 months. The airline said shareholders, banks, aircraft owners and suppliers owed money had approved the plan. Virgin Atlantic said ""this milestone"" puts it in a position to ""rebuild its balance sheet"" and ""welcome passengers back"". It had warned it would run out of cash by September without the deal. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. More than 64 millions meals have been served up as part of the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out discount scheme, according to the Treasury. The scheme offers diners up to Â£10 off their meals when they eat in restaurants, cafes and pubs between Monday and Wednesday in a bid to boost the pandemic hit hospitality sector. Data from OpenTable shows that during Eat Out to Help Outâs third week the number of customers at UK restaurants was 61% higher than the same days last year on average for Monday to Wednesday. Eat Out to Help Out is due to finish at the end of the month and has seen 87,000 claims made by businesses. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Todayâs figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality â with more than 64 million meals discounted so far, thatâs equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs. ""This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out, and in doing so, how this is helping to protect the jobs of nearly 2 million people who work in hospitality.""

capital Delhi has seen coronavirus cases rise by more than a quarter over the
previous week, according to the latest data. More
than 9,000 positive cases were recorded in the week from 18 August to 24
August, up from just over 7,200 the previous week. Thereâs
been little change in testing numbers since the start of August so that would
not account for the increase. The proportion of positive cases has also risen - from 5.8%
up to 7.8% over those two weeks. This
figure went as high as 31% in mid-June, and then dropped to 5.7% in July and is now
seeing a rise again. Delhi
has one of the highest testing rates in India, and has done nearly 76,000 tests
per million people, much higher than the national average of just under 27,000
per million. Thereâs

Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""There is a growing body of evidence that the use of face masks in communal areas in secondary schools helps protect students and staff and drive down transmission. ""The prime minister must listen to this evidence and act quickly to give certainty to parents and teachers who are just days away from schools reopening."" It comes after Scotland announced that pupils will have tocover their faces in corridors and on school transport from Monday. In Wales, the government has said it will review the use of face coverings in school with a decision expected to be made on Wednesday. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it is important that any decisions are ""proportionate"" and ""appropriate to their setting, and local population"". Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed, some Americans have managed to improve their finances, according to a new poll. Some 45% of Americans said they had managed to set more money aside than usual, while 26% were paying back debt faster than they had been before the pandemic, the poll conducted byThe Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research,externalfound. In total, about half of Americans say theyâve either saved more or paid back debt since the outbreak began. Health fears and compulsory closures meant many Americans have gone out less and as a result spent less on meals out, clothes and travel. Meanwhile, nearly 13 million people have lost a job, AP reports, andmore than 28 million people - nearly one fifth of the American workforce - were collecting some form of unemployment paymentin the week ending 1 August.

As we reported,Ofqual chief Sally Collier has resignedamid criticism for the part the exams regulator played in the A-levels and GCSEs results chaos. Former chief regulator Dame Glenys Stacey has been asked to take up the role temporarily, having previously held the position between 2011 and 2016. Ofqual said it had agreed temporary support arrangements with Ofsted to support ongoing work with GCSEs, A-levels and vocational qualifications, including autumn exams and the appeals process. In a statement  Ofqual said: ""The chief regulator Sally Collier has decided that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership. The Ofqual board supports Sally in this decision, and thanks her for her leadership and service over the past four years, which has included overseeing the successful introduction of an entirely new set of GCSEs and A-levels, and a new grading system."" Roger Taylor remains the chair of the watchdog and a new committee of the Ofqual board is being formed to oversee its work until the end of the year. This will be led by Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman, who previously worked at Ofqual. ""Taken together these arrangements will ensure that Ofqual has the extra capacity, support and oversight it needs both to tackle the remaining issues from this year's awarding process and to ensure that next year's arrangements command public confidence,"" the statement said. Scientists believe they have traced the first UK coronavirus case to a woman in Nottinghamshire. Analysis of samples by the University of Nottingham showed a 75-year-old woman, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February. A Surrey resident waspreviously believedto have caught the virus first. The woman is also understood to be first in the UK to die after contracting Covid-19. News of the case has emerged only now, because samples were being analysed in retrospect by researchers as they investigated the origins of the UK pandemic. Read morehere.

Speaking to Reuters news agency, he said doing so could hurt the development of other vaccines.

It comes as US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering plans to put out a vaccine before it has been fully tested. ""The one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA [emergency use authorisation] before you have a signal of efficacy,"" Dr Fauci said. ""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enrol people in their trial. ""To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective,"" he added. Read more on this story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Matthew Bailey in his 300-seater restaurant in Mortonhall Garden centre in Edinburgh Restaurateurs and hoteliers in Scotland are calling for a ban on background music to be lifted saying it is the ""kiss of death"" for the atmosphere in their premises. Owners criticised the rule, which came into effect in Scotland on 14 August, saying there ""was no logic"" to it. The rule is in place so people do not have to lean in to be heard. The Scottish government said there was an increased risk of Covid transmission when people raised their voices. James Thomson, owner of The Witchery restaurant and the five star Prestonfield House Hotel in Edinburgh, said the blanket ban was ""ridiculous"". James Thomson in his five star restaurant, Rhubarb, at Prestonfield House Hotel in Edinburgh He said: ""This is a nonsense for restaurants. No size fits all. Very loud music in nightclubs could cause people to lean in to each other but in hotels and restaurants background music adds a little bit of ambience. ""Having no music at all is the kiss of death in terms of atmosphere for us and there is no logic behind such a blanket ban. ""At five star level we work on a two-metre distance all year round anyway so this background music ban is just ridiculous. ""We need background music to kill the deathly hush as people feel they have to start whispering when a restaurant is quiet. Diners want to eat out in a place with atmosphere not a library."" Dominic Crolla, director of La Locanda in Edinburgh's Cockburn Street, said he did not understand why the rule covered restaurants Dominic Crolla, director of La Locanda off the Royal Mile in Cockburn Street, said he did not understand the music ban rule for restaurants. He said: ""I understand people might have to lean in to be heard in a nightclub but background music should be allowed in restaurants. ""The ban is a disgrace, I get it for nightclubs, but for restaurants it's ridiculous. ""My customers come to hear classic Italian music while enjoying Italian food but now the atmosphere is ruined with this ban. ""They are just guessing and it just doesn't add up."" Rod Dos Santos, manager of Southern Cross Cafe in Edinburgh's Cockburn Street, said the music ban was ""ridiculous"". Rod Dos Santos, manager of Southern Cross Cafe in Cockburn Street, said the music ban was ""ridiculous"" He said: ""We either operate fully or not at all. What are they going to do next, tell us we cannot serve coffee? ""Customers expect to experience what they have done previously. This is a ridiculous situation. ""Background music is a talking point and customers are often asking me what band is playing in the background and it starts a conversation, which is what I love."" Matthew Bailey, general manager of Mortonhall Garden centre which has the 300-seater Topiary restaurant, said he had already cut his capacity by a third to comply with social distancing measures. He said: ""Music brings ambience and creates a nice mood. Soft music creates a nice atmosphere and stops the restaurant feeling clinical. ""It enhances the atmosphere in the current climate where people are more uptight and sombre. It softens the mood and relaxes people. ""We should be allowed to play background music as it creates a feeling of harmony."" No music is played in Edinburgh's The Standing Order, which is owned by Wetherspoon Meanwhile Eddie Gerson, spokesman of Wetherspoon, which owns 75 pubs in Scotland, said he stopped playing music in his premises 14 years ago. He said: ""We don't go with the crowd so we don't have music in any of our premises. ""Our customers are used to it and like it. We have shown you don't need music to run a pub."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We don't want the restrictions in place for any longer than is needed, but in order to continue to suppress Covid-19 the clinical advice remains that pubs and bars should have no background music or volume from TVs. ""This is because of the increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets when people raise their voices. ""We continue to monitor this and are working closely with the licensed trade to develop updated guidance based on the best public health advice to keep people safe.""

"BTec students are beginning to receive their revised grades after the results were delayed by exam board, Pearson. The results have been reassessed in line with A-level and GCSE grades which rose after a government U-turn. Pearson said students who needed their grades for university entry were being prioritised but all results would be available by Friday. BTec teacher Jenny Cameron said her students were finally receiving results they should have had two weeks ago. Ms Cameron, who teaches BTec performing arts in Cheltenham, told the Press Association almost all her students' original results had been two grades lower than they should have been. ""They are overjoyed today and got the results they should have had two weeks ago... because Pearson actually looked at them as individuals and not data."" She said the delay had put them in a difficult position as they waited to discover whether they could go to university or drama school. ""The students have been treated really shoddily. ""It's been two weeks of unnecessary stress and worry."" Pearson has apologised for the frustration and additional uncertainty caused by the delay and promised that no grades would go down as a result of the review. About 450,000 students were affected when Pearson pulled some of its BTec results on the eve of releasing them. It followed the government's last-minute U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs, which saw students awarded the exact grades that had been estimated by their teachers rather than having them adjusted by an algorithm. That had been put in place to counter the effect of any teachers or schools inflating their grades but there was an outcry over how many A-level results ended up being downgraded, in some cases by more than one grade. BTec grades pulled on eve of results day What went wrong with BTec students' grades? BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' Pearson initially said that because BTec students do far more graded assessments throughout the year, their predicted grades were more similar to previous years. However, it later decided to withdraw grades to ensure that no students had been downgraded, which might unfairly disadvantage them against A-level and GCSE students. BTecs are vocational qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which provide work-based skills across areas including business, healthcare and engineering. They are assessed over the course of the qualification through exams, practical coursework and, in many cases, workplace-based placements. Around 200,000 BTec Firsts, which are equivalent to one or more GCSEs, were due to be awarded on Thursday last week - the same day as GCSE results. Some 250,000 BTec Nationals, which are studied over one or two years and are similar to A-levels, were awarded the week before - but have also been part of the grade reassessment.

"Ronaldinho, left, and his brother Roberto de Assis Moreira appeared in court on Monday Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho has been released from house arrest in Paraguay after his detention for holding a forged passport. The World Cup winner and his brother spent one month behind bars and another four detained in a luxury hotel in the capital Asuncion on bail. Both have now been released, although they must pay $200,000 (Â£153,000) in damages between them. Ronaldinho had a glittering football career before his retirement in 2015. He helped Brazil to their fifth World Cup victory in 2002 and won the Champions League and two La Liga titles with Spanish football club Barcelona, as well as playing for Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. The decade of downfall that put a star behind bars In March he and his brother, Roberto de Assis Moreira - who is also his business manager - were detained afterallegedly using fake passports to enter Paraguay. Ronaldinho was travelling to the country to promote a campaign for underprivileged children. He spent his 40th birthday in a Paraguayan prison before the pair paid bail and moved to a luxury hotel under house arrest. Prosecutors did not think the footballer had any role getting the false passports, but they believed his brother knew they were fake. Both however have maintained their innocence. ""The precautionary measure of arrest is lifted, there are no more restrictions placed by Paraguayan justice,"" Judge Gustavo Amarilla told the court on Monday.

"This video can not be played Mostafa is unable to work until the paperwork is completed ""Before I left my country I used to have a car, a good job, a house, but I left because I wanted to be safe."" Mostafa Alhamad is an asylum-seeker from Syria, living in Cardiff, and one of hundreds in Wales waiting for a decision on their application. One of the consequences of coronavirus has meant the already overloaded system has ground to a halt. Mostafa was a businessman before the war changed his family's life. But the 30-year-old graduate is unable to work - or study management and fulfil his long-term ambition of opening a restaurant - until the paperwork is completed. Mostafa arrived in the UK from Lebanon nearly a year ago, having initially fled war-torn Syria. He has been in Cardiff for the last 10 months. But his story is tinged with tragedy. Mostafa and his wife Zainab left Syria for Lebanon initially He and his wife Zainab had left Syria as refugees in 2013 to begin a new life in Lebanon. Mostafa, with a degree in English literature, was required to pick a side in the civil war and enlist. He was the ""perfect age"" to be in the army and his academic background meant he was considered smart and suitable for the front line. ""I had to choose to serve in the army or leave the country, I chose to leave the country because I wanted to live,"" he said. Mostafa's children Mohammad and Rodina He opened up a restaurant in Lebanon and the couple had two children. All appeared to be going well for six years but visa and citizenship rules there meant they had to sell up and leave last year. Mostafa was not allowed to have a bank account and was unable to control his own finances or business. To avoid a military call-up back in Syria, he sourced an expensive flight out on the black market but couldn't afford for the whole family to leave. His wife returned to Syria to stay with her family in Damascus, but in February last year their three-year old son Mohammad was killed when their flat - damaged in the war - collapsed while Zainab inspected the property. Mohammad died when the family's flat collapsed in Syria The loss of his young son, he said, changed everything. When you lose a child ""you're not gonna think the same way,"" he said. ""You're not gonna do the same things in the future. All your dreams will be different and almost everything will be different."" Mostafa with his daughter Rodina and son Mohammad (left) who died aged three ""I lost many family members in Syria. My son, my uncle, cousins, and many friends in the university - they're all dead now."" His wife and four year old daughter remain in Damascus. Mostafa has been given accommodation in Cardiff and has Â£37.75 a week to live on but he is keen to dispel any notion he's in the UK to take advantage of welfare benefits. Under rules he is not able to work. ""Sometimes you have to choose between buying essentials like food - or data to speak to your family,"" he said. ""I haven't any family members in the UK, my wife and daughter are in Syria, my brother is in Turkey."" He's aware most asylum seekers he comes across have waited two to three years for a decision. In an ideal world, he would return to Syria to start up a business but ""safety is a priority"". ""I wanted to be safe, money isn't important."" Figures from the Wales Strategic Migration Partnership for last October showed there were 2,626 asylum seekers in Wales. Mostafa was due to have his face-to-face interview with officials - a key part of the process - in March but lockdown was announced three days before his appointment and everything was put on hold. Campaigners believe people seeking refuge from persecution and civil war should be allowed to work, especially now as the numbers waiting for a decision continue to rise. City of Sanctuary supports over 100 groups in the UK who work with asylum seekers and refugees within their communities. The charity said there had been delays in the system for years but the Covid-19 pandemic had created further backlog because face-to-face interviews had to be halted for safety. Figures up to March showed: 53,709 asylum seekers in the UK were waiting for a decision on their application to be given refugee status 31,516 people in the UK were waiting longer than six months - that's a 40% rise on the numbers waiting at the end of 2019 Of the 8,719 appeals lodged to March 2020, 45% were successful, meaning the Home Office decision was overturned and they were granted asylum. Maesteg-based Sian Summers-Rees, chief officer of City of Sanctuary, said: ""The asylum system itself is dehumanising. Sometimes the system can take years and the quality of the decision-making by the Home Office is not good."" Pandemic hits help for refugees and asylum seekers Volunteers sought to host asylum seekers in homes Asylum seeker 'went without food' in lockdown The UK's policy on allowing people to work while they await an asylum decision is more restrictive than other countries. ""Unfortunately they are unable to work whilst they're in the asylum process, so what we would be calling for is better-quality decision making, as well as quicker decision making,"" said Ms Summer-Rees. ""But in the meantime for people to be able to work and contribute to society."" Asylum seekers can apply for permission to work after 12 months, but only in skilled ""shortage"" areas, making the UK's policy more restrictive than many countries They are encouraged to volunteer whilst their claim is being considered with a charity or public sector organisation, supporting their local community, and this will also assist with their integration if they are granted leave to remain in the UK The EU has a nine-month rule in place, USA has six months, and Canada and Australia allow asylum seekers to work immediately - only the UK has rules on the type of work that can be done While asylum policy is set by the UK government, the Welsh Government has lobbied for work restrictions to be relaxed as ""the skills of asylum seekers are currently being wasted"". The principle behind the Home Office rules,externalis to ensure a clear distinction between economic migration and asylum that discourages those who do not need protection from claiming asylum to benefit from economic opportunities they would not otherwise be eligible for. It also aims to prevent illegal migration for economic reasons. While reduced global movement saw a 69% fall in asylum applications in the first four weeks of lockdown in the UK, face-to-face interviews were naturally postponed. The Home Office insists it is carefully considering the arguments over the rights of asylum seekers to work. It said it had restarted interviews at the end of July, when social distancing was possible, on top of video conferencing, and numbers were being completed ""at pace across the UK"". ""Asylum seeker right to work is a complex issue and is under review,"" said a spokesperson. ""However, asylum seekers are permitted to work in jobs on the shortage occupation list if they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for more than 12 months, through no fault of their own.""

"Brother Biagio and Brother David were not originally planning to visit Wales on their journey Two Italian monks are in Wales as they walk from London to Ireland on a ""pilgrimage of peace"". Brother Biagio and colleague Brother David refuse to accept lifts and carry no money, relying on the hospitality of strangers they meet along the way. Dressed in full monastic robes, they also fast as they walk, drinking only water during the day. The pair set off from London three weeks ago, and are now on Anglesey with the aim to sail to Dublin on Friday. They said they were on a five-year mission to walk through as many European countries as possible, talking to people and spreading a ""message of hope"". The monks who bought their own Scottish island St David: Ten things about the man and myth Former monk says coronavirus is 'warning to world' Speaking through his colleague as a translator, Brother Biagio said: ""We are on a pilgrimage. ""We are trying to talk to as many people as possible and tell them that there is hope, that there can be a better world. That hope comes from God. ""We tell people to respond to evil with good actions and we must stand together as a human race."" The pair said they had found people in Wales to be very spiritual Brother Biagio set off from Italy five years ago and reached London at the end of last year, but the coronavirus pandemic made it difficult for him to continue until now. In Italy, he is known as a social justice campaigner, setting up a centre in Palermo, Sicily, to help homeless people and people with addictions. On his latest stage of the walk he has visited Leicester and Liverpool, where he had planned to cross to Ireland but could not get a ferry.

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" The Republican National Convention is nearing its conclusion, with Donald Trump set to close the event with a speech making the case for his re-election. What's been happening at the four-day event? Let's back up first. There's an obvious question... OK, good question. Party conventions take place once every four years - they are the ceremonial crowning of the party's presidential candidate as they prepare for the final phase of campaigning. Last time around, we saw the Trump family take centre stage to a backdrop of fireworks and a sea of red, white and blue balloons. This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" It's also where party officials wrap up other less glamorous business, like unveiling the political platform and adopting rules. This time - for the first time - no new platform is being adopted. The party will continue to support Mr Trump's 2016 manifesto. As the sitting president, Mr Trump is the de facto nominee but the convention has formally nominated him with a roll call, nonetheless. On Thursday, the president will formally accept the nomination with a big speech. The conventions of years past have been glitzy affairs, bringing together thousands of delegates, party leaders, activists and celebrities for receptions, speeches and general hyping up of the presidential candidate. But the pandemic has upended all that. Unlike its Democratic counterpart, the Republican Convention is hosting some in-person events at venues in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington DC, along with speeches delivered remotely. Each day will follow themes of America as the land of promise, opportunity, heroes and - in a nod to Trump's slogan - greatness. People are being told they need to wear masks and social distance. Those attending events are given a self-swab Covid-19 test before travelling and entering their hotels. Trump has been involved in some regard each day of the convention, either in person or in recorded videos. He will accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Does Don Jr say what his dad really thinks? This hasn't been entirely well received - with critics arguing using federal property for a campaign speech is unethical. In addition to President Trump, the following will be speaking on Thursday: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a senior White House adviser Alice Johnson, a criminal justice reform advocate whose life sentence was commuted by the president after a campaign led by Kim Kardashian The parents of Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who was taken hostage and killed in Syria Vice-President Pence addressed the convention remotely from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, where the city was defended against the British in the War of 1812, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Francis Scott Key saw the flag at the fort and wrote the words that later became the national anthem The former Indiana governor argued that Joe Biden would set the country on to ""a path of socialism and decline"". Pence warns Americans 'won't be safe' if Biden wins As pitchman for Mr Trump's re-election, he said voters need ""a president who believes in America"". This video can not be played Pence: Stakes in this election never higher On a night with the theme ""Land of Heroes"", his wife Karen Pence also addressed the convention, paying tribute to ""military spouses"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House next week, said of Mr Trump: ""He has stood by me, and he will stand up for you."" Kellyanne Conway said she had made the decision in order to focus on her children The 53-year-old announced this week that she was resigning from her postas senior adviser to Mr Trump at the end of August to focus on her children, giving them ""less drama, more mama"". Two black speakers on Wednesday spoke in support of President Trump. Clarence Henderson, a civil rights activist from the 1960s, spoke about the power of peaceful protest and the Republican Party's record on civil rights. Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and Fox News commentator, who is running for office in Utah, pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message. Several military veterans also addressed the convention as well as four of the party's rising female stars: Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, New York Representative Elise Stefanik, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump. US First LadyMelania Trump made a heartfelt plea for racial unitywhen she delivered a live speech from the White House on Tuesday. The day also saw two of the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump, making fierce attacks on the Democrats while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Israel, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, and critics called his participation unethical. Monday, the convention's opening day, was dominated bya speech by President Trump himself in which he warned Republicans their opponents might ""steal"" November's election. His claim that postal voting could lead to voter fraud has been dismissed by experts and election officials as a conspiracy theory. Trump's 2016 speech and 'the truth' From 2016: Trump promises a 'safer' America This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This is the greatest scam in the history of politics"" His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, described Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". The convention is expected to last 2.5 hours each night, Monday to Thursday, from 20:30 EST (00:30 GMT) to 23:00 EST (03:00 GMT). You can follow the latest news, including a live page on Thursday, atbbc.com/news. BBC World News and the BBC News Channel (available globally and in the UK, respectively) will broadcast Mr Trump's speech live and bring you reaction and analysis afterwards. And you can also watchon the Republican National Convention website.,external Few incumbent presidents of the modern era have faced a challenge as great as the one before Donald Trump in the final months of their re-election campaign. He has consistently trailed Joe Biden in the polls by a modest but significant margin for months. The Republican Convention is one of his last, best opportunities to turn the tide. The president's speech will be a good guide for how the Republicans hope to conduct their campaign over the final months. Will he focus on tearing down Joe Biden or on accomplishments from early in his presidency? Or will he try to convince the public that the worst days of the pandemic are over? The Democrats during their convention turned to voices from ""ordinary"" Americans - immigrants, workers and minorities - who said they had been harmed by the president's policies. The Republicans have countered with ones who will recount how they've been helped - or who are worried about what the Democrats would do in power. Have they made a compelling case? The rest of the week has been be filled with Republican officeholders of various levels. Some, including Vice-President Mike Pence, will be vying for position to lead the partyonce Trump leaves office - either next year or in 2024. Four years ago, Trump defied conventional practices and wisdom to win the presidency. He's remade the Republican Party in his image, with an emphasis on conservative populism and sometimes brash rhetoric. That new party, his party, has been on full display this week. Now we watch as campaigning heats up before the general election on 3 November. Be sure to set a reminder for the debates too, where we'll see Biden and Trump battle to win over voters. The first presidential debate is scheduled for 29 September with two more in October. Correction 21st June 2022: An earlier version of this article reported that Clarence Henderson had pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message and this has been amended to correctly characterise his remarks, which focused on peaceful process and the Republican Party's history.

"This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin There have been clashes for a second night in Wisconsin, with buildings and cars set alight, following the police shooting of a black man on Sunday. Jacob Blake, 29, is in a stable condition after he was shot several times as he went to a car and opened its door in the city of Kenosha. Governor Tony Evers has called up the National Guard to aid local police. The killing of black man George Floyd in Minnesota in May led to protests against racism and police brutality. Demonstrations across the US and in many cities internationally put a spotlight on the treatment of African-Americans by US law enforcement and prompted a wider reflection on racism in society. How are African Americans treated under the law? Five pieces of context to understand US protests Why do some protests turn violent? Video footage of the Kenosha shooting, taken from across the street and shared on social media, shows Mr Blake leaning into the car and an officer grabbing his shirt, with seven shots heard. A curfew has been in effect in Kenosha from 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT) until 07:00 on Tuesday - but has been defied by some protesters. This video can not be played Wisconsin's Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes says the shooting was ""familiar violence to too many of us"" The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Kenosha It had started out as an evening reminiscent of so many in towns and cities across the US after the killing of George Floyd, with hundreds of young people in Kenosha breaking a curfew to confront police lined up outside the courthouse. The demonstrators, here this time to call for justice for Jacob Blake, were initially pushed back and dispersed with strong tear gas and the use of sound bombs, but kept returning. Even now in the early hours of the morning they still face the officers in their riot shields. ""We're not leaving"", they chant. In the surrounding streets we saw vehicles set on fire, buildings vandalised and whole rows of streetlights pulled down. ""It is a breath of fresh air,"" one young protester told me. ""I am tired of being scared of the police killing me. Tonight they are going to listen."" Ina press release,external, Governor Evers said the ""limited mobilisation"" of the National Guard - made at the request of local officials - was to help law enforcement ""protect critical infrastructure"" and make sure people could demonstrate safely. He said he was deploying 125 members of the National Guard on Monday night. Earlier in the day some protesters tried to force their way into Kenosha's public safety building, demanding that the officers involved in the shooting be arrested. A door was broken off its hinges before officers in riot gear used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. At least one officer was injured in the neck by a firework, the New York Times reported. Buildings and cars were set alight in Kenosha Hundreds of people had also marched on police headquarters on Sunday night to demonstrate against the shooting. Governor Evers has condemned the shooting, saying Mr Blake was ""not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."" But the Democratic governor has faced criticism for this response. Pete Deates, head of Kenosha's police union, said Mr Evers' statement was ""wholly irresponsible"" and said people should wait until all facts were known. Many of the protesters were chanting ""Justice for Jacob"" Mr Evers has also said there will be a special session of the state legislature on 31 August to discuss a package of laws announced earlier this year on accountability and transparency of the police following the police killing of George Floyd. Lawmakers had ""failed to act"" in the two months since he announced the ""commonsense policies"", the governor tweeted. Demonstrations have also spread to other parts of the country, with disturbances reported as protesters marched through Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon. ""This is now a RIOT. Leave the area now,"" Portland Police tweeted as fires were being lit near the police building. Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday. It added that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. The person who shot the video, Raysean White, said that before he began taking it, he saw police wrestle with Mr Blake. He said police punched and Tasered Mr Blake. ""Jacob kind of leaned on the car and they proceeded to wrestle him toward the back of the car and he went to the other side,"" Mr White told CNN. It was then he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident The police said officers had been responding to a ""domestic incident"" but gave no details about what led to the shooting. They have not said how many officers were involved and no names have been given. Police in Kenosha do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Mr Blake's partner, Laquisha Booker, told a local NBC channel that the couple's three children were in the back of the vehicle at the time and saw the shooting. Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the families of George Floyd and others pursuing actions against the police, has announced he is representing Mr Blake's family. In a statement released on Twitter,externalhe said the 29-year-old father ""was helping to de-escalate a domestic incident"" at the time. Mr Crump said the officers' ""irresponsible, reckless and inhumane actions nearly cost the life of a man who was simply trying to do the right thing"". Mr Blake, who works as a security guard, is now out of surgery and improving.

"Facebook has agreed to pay the French government â¬106m (Â£95.7m) in back taxes to settle a dispute over revenues earned in the country. The payment covers the last decade of its French operations from 2009. The social networking giant has also agreed to pay â¬8.46m in taxes on revenues in France for 2020 - 50% more than in 2019. ""We pay the taxes we owe in every market we operate,"" said a Facebook spokeswoman. ""We take our tax obligations seriously and work closely with tax authorities around the world to ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and to resolve any disputes, as we have done with the French tax authorities."" The social networking giant did not share details of the tax dispute, but France has been pushing tech companies to pay more tax inside the country where it is generated. Other tech giants like Google, Apple and Amazon have reached similar agreements with the French tax authorities. Facebook said that since 2018, it had changed its sales structure so that ""income from advertisers supported by our teams in France is registered in this country"". The BBC understands that Facebook paid a tax rate in France of 38% in 2019, which is above the statutory income tax rate of 33.3%. In February, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg saidhe recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech giants. He added that Facebook accepted the fact it might have to pay more tax in Europe ""in different places under a new framework"" going forward, and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution to how to tax tech companies. Facebook has been accused of not paying its fair share of tax in the countries where it operates. Last year, France announced a new digital services tax on multinational technology firms, but in January, the country saidit would delay the tax until the end of 2020. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg testified before the US House Judiciary Committee in July over antitrust concerns The new tax would have required global tech giants to make tax payments equivalent to 3% of their French revenues twice a year in April and in November. In response to France delaying the new tax, the US said it would not impose retaliatory tariffs on $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) of French goods, including champagne and cheese. The OECD is working on a multilateral agreement on how tech giants should be taxed by governments. In the UK, Facebook paid just Â£28.5m in corporation tax in 2018, despite generating a record Â£1.65bn in British sales. The UK government implemented its own tax on technology firms in April. The Digital Services Tax (DST) requires digital services operating in the UK to pay a 2% tax in connection to social media services, internet search engines and online marketplaces. HM Treasury has stressed that the tax will remain in place until a global solution to taxing tech giants is agreed. In June, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and finance ministers in France, Italy and Spainsigned a letter saying that tech giants, like Google, Amazon and Facebook, need ""to pay their fair share of tax"". In the letter, obtained by the BBC, the four finance ministers told the US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, that the pandemic had increased the need for such levies. ""The current Covid-19 crisis has confirmed the need to deliver a fair and consistent allocation of profit made by multinationals operating without - or with little - physical taxable presence,"" the letter said. ""The pandemic has accelerated a fundamental transformation in consumption habits and increased the use of digital services, consequently reinforcing digital business models' dominant position and increasing their revenue at the expense of more traditional businesses.""

"Mr Navalny is being treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin The Berlin hospital treating the seriously ill Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, says he appears to have been poisoned. The CharitÃ© hospital released a statement saying ""clinical evidence suggests an intoxication through a substance belonging to the group of cholinesterase inhibitors"". But doctors who treated him in Russia say the substance was not present. Mr Navalny fell ill on an internal flight in Russia on Thursday. Video appeared to show Mr Navalny, a dogged critic of the Kremlin, writhing in agony on the flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea he drank at the airport in Tomsk. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny's flight made an emergency landing in Omsk where he was first treated. In their latest statement released after that of the German medical team, the Omsk doctors say tests showed no sign of cholinesterase inhibitors in his body. Speaking last week, the same team suggested his illness was caused by a metabolic disorder triggered by low blood sugar. On Friday, they at first said he was too ill to be moved but then allowed him to board a medical evacuation flight, which landed in Berlin on Saturday morning. His condition was ""serious but not life-threatening"" the statement said. ""The exact substance is not yet known,"" the hospital said. ""Widespread analysis has begun. The effect of the poison - i.e. the inhibition of cholinesterase in the organism - has been proven several times and in independent laboratories."" The clinical outcome remained unclear, the statement said, and the medical team warned of possible effects on the nervous system. Navalny's wife Yulia has been at his bedside at the CharitÃ© The opposition leader is in intensive care and is still in an artificial coma. Mr Navalny is being given an antidote, atropine, the same drug used inthe case of ex-KGB agent Sergei Skripalby UK doctors after his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. They are a group of chemicals, some of which can be used to treat diseases, such as Alzheimer's. When used in nerve agents and pesticides they can be harmful to humans. ""Cholinesterase inhibitors block a crucial enzyme which regulates messages from nerves to muscles,"" says Alastair Hay, Professor (Emeritus) of Environmental Toxicology at Leeds University. ""The enzyme is called acetylcholinesterase.  Inhibition of the enzyme interferes with nerve to muscle messaging and muscles are no longer able to contract and relax.  They go into a sort of spasm. ""All muscles are affected with the most crucial being those which affect breathing.  As breathing is inhibited individuals may become unconscious."" They have been blaming the Kremlin. Doctors in Omsk had at first been co-operative in helping to transfer Mr Navalny abroad for treatment, they said, but had then backtracked before he was finally allowed to leave. His wife, Yulia, said she feared the Russian authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear before sending him abroad. But President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary, describing it as a purely medical decision. Alexander Murakhovsky, the chief doctor at the Omsk hospital said: ""There was no influence on the treatment of the patient a priori and there couldn't have been any."" Mr Navalny, 44, is a prominent critic of Mr Putin and has exposed official corruption in Russia. He has  served multiple jail terms for organising rallies. The NGO which arranged his flight to Berlin, the Cinema for Peace, said Mr Navalny would probably be out of action for one or two months. In her latest comments, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for those behind any poisoning to be identified and held accountable. In a joint statement with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, she said: ""In view of Mr Navalny's prominent role in the political opposition in Russia, the authorities there are now urgently called upon to investigate this act thoroughly, and to do so with full transparency."" The UK called on Saturday for a ""full and transparent"" investigation. And US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden vowed over the weekend that, if elected, he would ""stand up to autocrats like Putin"". April 2017:He was taken to hospital afteran antiseptic green dye was splashed on his facein Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) that year. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" he tweeted following the attack. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid in 2017 July 2019:He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for unauthorised protests. He fell ill in jail and doctors said he had suffered an acute allergic reaction, diagnosing him with ""contact dermatitis"". His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"" and Mr Navalny saidhe thought he might have been poisoned.

"President Trump has criticised the expansion of postal voting in the presidential election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? The US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic with a record number of Americans having voted by post. Election authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots. This has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. There have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers. But the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017study by the Brennan Center for Justice,external. And Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud."" Let's look at some specific examples where fraud has been claimed this year. Virginia Speaking at a rally in mid-October, Donald Trump said: ""In Virginia, 500,000 applications were made that were false."" And these applications, to apply for an absentee ballot form, were sent out with the wrong return address. But the electoral authorities in Virginia say there was no fraudulent intent and the mistake has been corrected. The Virginia Center for Voter Information (CVI) said: ""We worked for weeks to make sure that no Virginia voter was inconvenienced as a result of our printing error."" Ohio President Trumptweeted:,external""In Ohio, 50,000 ballots were wrong, fraudulent - 50,000."" About 50,000 voters did receive the wrong ballot in the post, in Franklin County, Ohio, in early October. But there is no evidence this was done fraudulently. And the local elections board said everyone affected was sent the correct voter slip, with safeguards in place to ensure no-one voted twice. The board said the ballot error had been a ""serious mistake"". But in response to the president's tweet, it added: ""Our board is bipartisan and our elections are fair - and every vote will be counted."" InNew York, nearly 100,000 ballots were resent to voters after some names and addresses were printed incorrectly. InMichiganabout 400 postal ballots listed the wrong running mate for President Trump - the Libertarian Party's Jeremy Cohen instead of Mike Pence. President Trump claimed in September this had been deliberate. But the Michigan secretary of state said it had been an error and ""impacted voters immediately received an accurate ballot and guidance to ensure their vote counts"". Allow Twitter content?

InNew Jersey, a mail carrier was charged after dumping hundreds of items of post in a dumpster, including almost 100 election ballots.

These safeguards are being applied to all postal votes. A record number of people have voted by post this time round, with more than 65 million sent in,according to one compilation of data from different states.,external In August, the head of the US Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, told lawmakers that the service was ""fully capable and committed"" to handling postal votes.

"Slower mail delivery times have raised concerns about how one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the US - the Postal Service - can handle an unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots in November's election. Owing to the coronavirus pandemic this year, an unprecedented number of voters are expected to submit their ballot by mail. It's up to states to determine how they arrange postal voting and there are mounting fears that some are not ready. The US Postal Service (USPS) is a government agency. Its board of governors appoints the postmaster general - a process which is meant to distance the position from politics. But the board's members are all appointed by the president and approved by the Senate, which is currently controlled by Donald Trump's Republican party. Louis DeJoy is a political appointee recently hired by President Trump. He has donated more than $1.2m (Â£920,000) to political action funds in support of the president. Mr DeJoy has been accused by top Democrats of implementing changes to how mail is processed in a deliberate effort to ""sabotage the election"". He has defended the changes, which include cuts to overtime and delivery trips, as ""data-driven"", but said last week he would delay them until after the election. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans and Mr Trump counter that the new measures are needed to address the agency's multi-million dollar budget shortfall. Mr Trump has said the price tag for emergency funds requested by Congress to shore up mail-in voting is too expensive and will lead to voter fraud. The US House of Representatives has now approved a bill that would inject $25bn (Â£19bn) into the USPS, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the upper chamber of Congress would ""absolutely not pass"" it. Jake Horton, BBC Reality Check In May, Republican megadonor Louis DeJoy was tapped by the White House to be the first postmaster general in more than 20 years to not come from within the agency's own ranks. Seeking to address the $160bn (Â£122bn) budget shortfall at the USPS, Mr DeJoy implemented several new measures in July which have come under scrutiny. US media report that more than 600 mail sorting machines are being decommissioned - around 10% of the service's machines. The Postal Service has said it ""routinely moves equipment around its network as necessary to match changing mail and package volumes"". The amount of mail has been down so far this year, but there are concerns the reduction in machines - which process millions of pieces of mail per hour - could limit the handling capacity of postal ballots in the build-up to the election. Many polling stations in the US are often staffed by elderly volunteers who this year are expected to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid-19. Other elections held during the pandemic, such as a much-criticised primary race in Georgia, have seen a majority of polling places closed due to lack of staff. Long queues form at those that remain open. At least 60 postal workers have died from coronavirus, according to their union Some states have chosen to respond by posting a ballot to every single registered voter in the state - a practice known as universal mail-in voting. Other states require voters to request a ballot be sent to them, while some Republican-controlled states such as Texas and Mississippi - and Democrat-controlled New York - have said fear of catching coronavirus is not a good enough justification to vote by mail. Late last month, the USPS wrote to states to inform them that their election laws might mean that some ballots are returned too late to be counted. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, are attempting to change laws so that ballots that arrive after election day can still qualify. Trump blocks postal funds to stymie mail-in voting Democrats call for probe into US postal service Mr Trump has claimed that expanded mail-in voting would lead to the ""the most corrupt election"" in US history. Critics say people could vote more than once via absentee ballots and then again in person. But there is no evidence of widespread fraud. In fact, the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, says a2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice,external. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Mail boxes piled in storage in Connecticut Unlike other government agencies, the USPS does not run on taxpayer money, but relies on revenue from mail and packages, as well as other services to operate. However, mail volume has dropped by 30% since 2006, according to NBC News. And analysis by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that $78bn had been lost in recent years due to the decline as well as increased delivery costs. A law passed in 2006 required the USPS to pre-fund pensions for all employees 75 years into the future, a move that experts saycost around $72bn,external. Experts say the post office could easily absorb the expected influx of mail, even if every single eligible American were to vote by mail in November. In the week before Christmas, theUSPS typically delivers around 2.5 billion letters,external, or about 500 million cards per day. Louis DeJoy is a top Republican donor According to aNew York Times analysis,external, about 80 million ballots might be sent through the mail this year - more than double what was sent in the 2016 election. The Postal Service is one of the most trusted institutions in the US. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was the first postmaster general. Absentee voting, which President Trump himself regularly uses, was born on the battlefields of the Civil War, according toNational Geographic,external, with soldiers sending their completed ballots in the mail back to their home states. A survey in April by the Pew Research Center found that91% of Americans have a favourable view of it,external, making it the country's favourite government agency. For comparison, Americans give Congress about an 18% approval rating, according to aGallup poll,externalfrom July. Mr DeJoy was called to testify before the House of Representatives committee on Monday, following his appearance before a Senate panel last week. He acknowledged that some of the changes had caused delays but rejected claims he was trying to interfere with the election. ""We will do everything in our power and structure to deliver the ballots on time,"" he said in response to questions from Democrats. The postmaster general said he did not order any of the changes that prompted concern, and he did not know who had.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Face coverings may be introduced in Scottish high schools The use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland. The government is in the ""final stages"" of consultations with teachers and councils about having pupils wear face coverings while moving between classes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. Ministers are also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport - but not inside classrooms. The use of face coverings in schools is currently voluntary, although some schools have started advising staff and pupils to wear them to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Advice 'may change' on face coverings in schools More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. However, over the weekend the World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Education Secretary John Swinney was ""in the final stages of consulting teachers and local authorities on a recommendation for the use of face coverings by staff and pupils in secondary schools when moving around corridors and communal areas"". She said there was more mixing between different groups of children in these areas, and that there was less scope for effective ventilation. People are also thought to be more likely to raise their voices in crowded places, increasing the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Pupils may have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Ms Sturgeon said the government's scientific advisers were also considering whether face coverings should be made mandatory on school transport. However, she said they were ""not currently consulting on any proposal"" to have pupils wear masks in class, saying: ""There is greater scope for physical distancing in classrooms and face coverings are more likely to interfere with teaching and learning."" She added: ""The best way to ensure schools can stay open safely is for all of us to play our part in keeping transmission rates in the community as low as possible."" Some schoolsin Edinburgh, Inverness and Grantown on Speyhave written to parents recommending pupils wear masksdue to concerns about overcrowding as they move between lessons. The first minister said she expected the Scotland-wide move would be confirmed ""over the next couple of days"", and would constitute a change to guidance which schools would be expected to follow. She said: ""We are not talking about a mandatory system in the sense of there being penalties and enforcement in schools. I get the sense that schools - while I accept there will be a mixture of opinion around it - are themselves looking to follow this kind of approach. ""We will set out the detail when we get to the point of finalising the recommendation."" Under the existing guidance no-one is required to wear face coverings in school, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. However, anyone who wants to wear one is allowed to do so. A recent survey of nearly 30,000 teachers by the EIS teaching union found 41% supported the mandatory wearing of face coverings by senior pupils in classrooms. However, one parents group - Us For Them Scotland - claimed making masks mandatory ""could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma"". Health authorities are working to tackle a number of coronavirus ""clusters"" in Scotland, including one centred on the Kingspark School in Dundee. A total of 17 members of staff have tested positive, as well as two pupils,and all households connected to the school have been told to go into self-isolation for two weeks. A growing number of school pupils across Scotland have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings such as house parties. Ms Sturgeon said ""most"" transmission of the virus was not happening in schools, saying that ""the risk is greater of community transmission getting into schools"". She said the current consultation was only on a ""limited"" use of face coverings in schools, because of ""the relatively low levels of transmission we are currently seeing in the community"". However she added that ""where there are outbreaks there is an option for incident management teams to recommend more extensive use of face coverings for a period to protect public health"".

"Thousands of patients are likely to have been infected with coronavirus in UK hospitals, a study suggests. The King's College London study of 10 UK hospital sites plus one in Italy found at least one in eight patients who had received hospital treatment for coronavirus had caught it on-site. Researchers said that was a relatively low rate and showed there was effective infection control in place. They analysed data on 1,500 cases to 28 April, covering the peak in the UK. Lead author Dr Ben Carter said: ""The majority of these patients had already been in hospital for a long time. ""They were older, frailer and had pre-existing health conditions."" But they also had better outcomes than those admitted with the virus, probably because of faster diagnosis and, therefore, treatment. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Only those who tested positive 15 days or more after admission were counted as hospital-acquired infections, however. And if patients who tested positive after five to 14 days are included, the proportion increases to 23%. But, because of the long incubation period of the virus, it is impossible to be sure how many of these patients would have been infected in hospital. Prof Duncan Young, an expert in intensive-care medicine at Oxford University, said the study would also not have captured those infected during a short hospital stay, as patients were not followed up after discharge. And of course the study only looked at people who were being treated in hospital for coronavirus, so did not include the vast majority of people who caught the disease and either showed no illness or just recovered at home with no need for treatment. Those caveats do suggest the the risk of catching the virus in hospital remains still small.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This is the greatest scam in the history of politics"" US President Donald Trump has warned his fellow Republicans their opponents may ""steal"" November's election, as his party anointed him as their candidate. ""They're using Covid to defraud the American people,"" Mr Trump told delegates on the first day of the party convention in North Carolina. He repeated an untrue claim that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud. An unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? Experts and voting officials have dismissed the claim that mail-in voting leads to fraud as a false conspiracy theory. Mr Trump himself uses the system regularly. Opinion polls suggest he is lagging behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Mr Biden, the former vice-president to Barack Obama, has boasted a 10-point lead on occasions. Addressing delegates in person at a party conference that has been dramatically scaled back by the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Trump accused Democrats of ""using Covid to steal an election"". Rising stars of a post-Trump Republican party shine The son who is Trumpier than Trump Convention schedule: Melania to headline day two ""The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election,""Â heÂ said. ""We're going to win."" Mr Trump hadalso warned of a ""rigged"" election in 2016, as he trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls. But in 2016 the polls were far less clear and just a few percentage points separated Mr Trump and his then-rival Hillary Clinton at several points as election day neared. This video can not be played 'My father's entire worldview is that we can always do even better' On Monday, Mr Trump was officially nominated as a formality to be the Republican nominee at his party's convention in the city of Charlotte. Supporters cheered him, chanting: ""Four more years!"" The president is expected to make live television addresses on every day of the convention, leading up to his acceptance speech to the party jamboree on Thursday. It is unusual for candidates to address the convention before that point, as Mr Trump has done. Supporters cheer for Mr Trump during his visit to North Carolina Mr Trump has repeatedly asserted that expanded mail-in voting will lead to ""the most corrupt election"" in US history. But there is scant evidence of widespread voter fraud, and very few examples of any related criminal prosecutions. The rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice,external. Ellen Weintraub, commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, has said: ""There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud. None."" Mail-in voting is used by the US military, and even Mr Trump himself and members of his family. But a recent slowdown in mail deliveries due to cost-saving measures in the US postal system has fuelled concerns that ballots might not be returned by election day. What is US row over postal service about? Several states have sought to change their election laws to allow ballots to be counted days after the forthcoming presidential vote, which some analysts fear could lead to delays in declaring the presidential victor. A delegate in North Carolina wears a mask with the Republican Party's elephant logo A primary election in New York City this June took weeks to determine a winner after poll officials were deluged with 10 times the normal number of mail-in ballots. There was no allegation of fraud, but the debacle raised fears of a protracted vote count this November. Earlier this month, a New Jersey judge ordered a new vote after finding evidence of fraud in a May election that was conducted entirely by mail in Paterson. Four people were arrested, including a local city councilman and councilman-elect. The case has been frequently touted by the Trump campaign. The first night of the Republican National Convention was a two-and-a-half hour rebuttal to the accusations Democrats levelled at Donald Trump during the four nights of their convention last week. Did the president mishandle the coronavirus pandemic? The Republicans offered slick videos and first-hand accounts of the steps the president took to speed medical research, provide protective supplies and implement economic relief. Is the president inflaming racial divisions in the US? Former football star Herschel Walker spoke of his 37-year friendship with Mr Trump. Tim Scott, the first black Republican elected to the Senate in nearly 50 years, touted the president's work on sentencing reform and tax breaks for economically distressed communities. Does the president lack empathy? Congressman Jim Jordan spoke of how Mr Trump offered sympathies when a relative died, and the president himself held a pre-taped White House forum where he offered words of support for coronavirus survivors and healthcare workers. Polls suggest American voters have serious doubts about the president on all these issues - doubts that predated the Democratic convention attacks. Republicans have four days to assuage these concerns, chip away at Democratic opponent Joe Biden's lead and remind supporters what they like about Mr Trump's presidency. It's an imposing task, but the Republicans have identified what work has to be done. Republicans said Monday night's theme was ""Land of Promise"" and pledged their convention would be less ""negative"" than the Democrats' conference last week. But many of the Republican speakers warned in doom-laden tones what would happen if Americans voted in a President Biden. Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr said the Democratic presidential candidate was ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Were these the three hours that upset Trump's campaign? Florida congressman Matt Gaetz warned of a ""horror movie"" if Democrats won the White House. ""They'll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door,"" he said referring to a Central American immigrant street gang. Charlie Kirk, who runs conservative student groupÂ Turning Point USA, told viewers: ""Trump was elected to protect our families - our loved ones - from the vengeful mob that wishes to destroy our way of life, our neighbourhoods, schools, church and values."" This video can not be played The St Louis couple arrested after pointing guns at protesters address the Republican convention Former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley described facing discrimination as an Indian-American growing up in the South. ""I was a brown girl in a black and white world,"" she said. But she described the ""fashionable"" idea that America is a racist country as a ""lie"". What really went on in St Louis that day? The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career After Mr Biden implied in last week's speech to his party convention that Mr Trump was a racist, the Republican conference sought to deflect that charge back on Democrats. In a bid to woo a constituency that is crucial to Democratic electoral hopes, African-American speakers lavished praise on the president on Monday night. The headline speaker was South Carolina Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator. He said his grandfather had been forced out of school so he could pick cotton, but lived long enough to see his grandson elected. ""Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,"" he told delegates. He said America had made ""tremendous progress"" towards racial equality during the Trump presidency. This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' Former NFL star Herschel Walker, who is black, said: ""It hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is 'racist'. ""I take it as a personal insult that people would think I've had a 37-year friendship with a racist."" Georgia state representative Vernon Jones, a Democrat, accused his party of taking the black vote for granted. ""The Democratic Party does not want black people to leave the mental plantation they've had us on for decades,"" he said, evoking the legacy of slavery. Kim Klacik, a black Republican candidate for Maryland's Baltimore district, accused Mr Biden of believing that black people ""can't think for ourselves - that the colour of someone's skin dictates their political views"". A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center,externalsuggests that 83% of black voters identify or lean towards the Democratic Party, compared with just 10% who say they are Republican, or lean towards identifying as one.

"For most schools in Scotland the wearing of face coverings is currently voluntary More schools are advising pupils and staff to wear face coverings to help combat coronavirus. Grantown Grammar School in Grantown on Spey and Millburn Academy in Inverness have both said masks need to be worn between classes. Children across Scotland are not currently required to wear masks in either primary or high schools. But Nicola Sturgeon has said this advice couldchange for secondary school students in the ""near future"". The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masksand the EIS trade union posted a message on Twitter that it will ""will press [the] Scottish Government further on face covering protocols in light of WHO advice"". In a letter to parents, Grantown Grammar School explained the changes are being introduced because ""corridors are becoming crowded between lessons and at break and lunchtime, even with the one way system"". Millburn Academy in Inverness has asked pupils to wear face coverings Similar concerns about overcrowding as pupils move between lessons sparked theintroduction of face coverings at James Gillespie's High Schoolin Edinburgh. The letter to parents at Millburn Academy in Inverness also asks for face coverings to be worn on school buses. Education campaign group Us for Them Scotland, which says it has 9,500 members, claimed any move to make coverings mandatory for children would cause more harm than good. Organiser Jo Bisset, said: ""Everyone appreciates the health and safety of pupils and teachers has to be a priority. ""But forcing children to wear masks when there's little, if any, scientific evidence to support such a move could be hugely damaging. ""It could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma."" The Scottish government has said there is currently no evidence that coronavirus among young people is being transmitted in schools. Agrowing number of school pupils have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings, such as house parties or other indoor gatherings. A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ""There is currently no widespread transmission of the virus in Highland. ""However, there may be circumstances in some secondary schools, where physical distancing during movement between classes is more difficult due to the school layout, or there may be medical conditions which are assessed as an increased risk. ""We are currently updating our guidance to head teachers to provide clarity on this matter and we will enable people to wear face coverings where they wish to do so."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" The Republican National Convention is nearing its conclusion, with Donald Trump set to close the event with a speech making the case for his re-election. What's been happening at the four-day event? Let's back up first. There's an obvious question... OK, good question. Party conventions take place once every four years - they are the ceremonial crowning of the party's presidential candidate as they prepare for the final phase of campaigning. Last time around, we saw the Trump family take centre stage to a backdrop of fireworks and a sea of red, white and blue balloons. This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" It's also where party officials wrap up other less glamorous business, like unveiling the political platform and adopting rules. This time - for the first time - no new platform is being adopted. The party will continue to support Mr Trump's 2016 manifesto. As the sitting president, Mr Trump is the de facto nominee but the convention has formally nominated him with a roll call, nonetheless. On Thursday, the president will formally accept the nomination with a big speech. The conventions of years past have been glitzy affairs, bringing together thousands of delegates, party leaders, activists and celebrities for receptions, speeches and general hyping up of the presidential candidate. But the pandemic has upended all that. Unlike its Democratic counterpart, the Republican Convention is hosting some in-person events at venues in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington DC, along with speeches delivered remotely. Each day will follow themes of America as the land of promise, opportunity, heroes and - in a nod to Trump's slogan - greatness. People are being told they need to wear masks and social distance. Those attending events are given a self-swab Covid-19 test before travelling and entering their hotels. Trump has been involved in some regard each day of the convention, either in person or in recorded videos. He will accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Does Don Jr say what his dad really thinks? This hasn't been entirely well received - with critics arguing using federal property for a campaign speech is unethical. In addition to President Trump, the following will be speaking on Thursday: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a senior White House adviser Alice Johnson, a criminal justice reform advocate whose life sentence was commuted by the president after a campaign led by Kim Kardashian The parents of Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who was taken hostage and killed in Syria Vice-President Pence addressed the convention remotely from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, where the city was defended against the British in the War of 1812, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Francis Scott Key saw the flag at the fort and wrote the words that later became the national anthem The former Indiana governor argued that Joe Biden would set the country on to ""a path of socialism and decline"". Pence warns Americans 'won't be safe' if Biden wins As pitchman for Mr Trump's re-election, he said voters need ""a president who believes in America"". This video can not be played Pence: Stakes in this election never higher On a night with the theme ""Land of Heroes"", his wife Karen Pence also addressed the convention, paying tribute to ""military spouses"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House next week, said of Mr Trump: ""He has stood by me, and he will stand up for you."" Kellyanne Conway said she had made the decision in order to focus on her children The 53-year-old announced this week that she was resigning from her postas senior adviser to Mr Trump at the end of August to focus on her children, giving them ""less drama, more mama"". Two black speakers on Wednesday spoke in support of President Trump. Clarence Henderson, a civil rights activist from the 1960s, spoke about the power of peaceful protest and the Republican Party's record on civil rights. Burgess Owens, a former NFL player and Fox News commentator, who is running for office in Utah, pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message. Several military veterans also addressed the convention as well as four of the party's rising female stars: Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, New York Representative Elise Stefanik, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump. US First LadyMelania Trump made a heartfelt plea for racial unitywhen she delivered a live speech from the White House on Tuesday. The day also saw two of the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump, making fierce attacks on the Democrats while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Israel, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, and critics called his participation unethical. Monday, the convention's opening day, was dominated bya speech by President Trump himself in which he warned Republicans their opponents might ""steal"" November's election. His claim that postal voting could lead to voter fraud has been dismissed by experts and election officials as a conspiracy theory. Trump's 2016 speech and 'the truth' From 2016: Trump promises a 'safer' America This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This is the greatest scam in the history of politics"" His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, described Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as ""basically the Loch Ness monster of the swamp"". The convention is expected to last 2.5 hours each night, Monday to Thursday, from 20:30 EST (00:30 GMT) to 23:00 EST (03:00 GMT). You can follow the latest news, including a live page on Thursday, atbbc.com/news. BBC World News and the BBC News Channel (available globally and in the UK, respectively) will broadcast Mr Trump's speech live and bring you reaction and analysis afterwards. And you can also watchon the Republican National Convention website.,external Few incumbent presidents of the modern era have faced a challenge as great as the one before Donald Trump in the final months of their re-election campaign. He has consistently trailed Joe Biden in the polls by a modest but significant margin for months. The Republican Convention is one of his last, best opportunities to turn the tide. The president's speech will be a good guide for how the Republicans hope to conduct their campaign over the final months. Will he focus on tearing down Joe Biden or on accomplishments from early in his presidency? Or will he try to convince the public that the worst days of the pandemic are over? The Democrats during their convention turned to voices from ""ordinary"" Americans - immigrants, workers and minorities - who said they had been harmed by the president's policies. The Republicans have countered with ones who will recount how they've been helped - or who are worried about what the Democrats would do in power. Have they made a compelling case? The rest of the week has been be filled with Republican officeholders of various levels. Some, including Vice-President Mike Pence, will be vying for position to lead the partyonce Trump leaves office - either next year or in 2024. Four years ago, Trump defied conventional practices and wisdom to win the presidency. He's remade the Republican Party in his image, with an emphasis on conservative populism and sometimes brash rhetoric. That new party, his party, has been on full display this week. Now we watch as campaigning heats up before the general election on 3 November. Be sure to set a reminder for the debates too, where we'll see Biden and Trump battle to win over voters. The first presidential debate is scheduled for 29 September with two more in October. Correction 21st June 2022: An earlier version of this article reported that Clarence Henderson had pushed Mr Trump's law-and-order message and this has been amended to correctly characterise his remarks, which focused on peaceful process and the Republican Party's history.

"Many of the youngsters at Kingspark have additional physical disabilities or medical problems A total of 27 coronavirus cases, most of them adult staff, have now been linked to a school in Dundee. Kingspark School was closed last Wednesday as pupils and staff were asked to self-isolate for 14 days. NHS Tayside said in an update on Monday that 21 staff, two pupils and four community contacts had tested positive. Two other school sites in Dundee have also been identified as result of contact tracing connected to the Kingspark outbreak. A primary two class at St Peter and Paul's School has been asked to self-isolate until 2 September after an individual tested positive. Children who attended the Happy Times out-of-school club at Downfield Primary School are also being asked to self-isolate until the same date following a positive test result. Coronavirus cases in Scotland up by 83 Dundee school closed after adults test positive Where have school pupils tested positive for Covid-19? Elsewhere,two classes at High Blantyre Primary School in South Lanarkshire are self-isolatingafter two pupils and a staff member tested positive. NHS Lanarkshire said there was no evidence to suggest transmission within the school and the school will remain open. Kingspark School in Dundee, which has about 185 pupils aged between five and 18 who have additional support needs, was closed on Wednesday evening to allow deep cleaning to be carried out. The decision was taken to shut it for two weeks because of the complex health conditions of the pupils. Pupils and anyone who lives with them who cannot maintain physical distancing have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Dr Daniel Chandler, of NHS Tayside, said: ""Due to the high level of tests undertaken among staff who work at the school, we may see a small rise in the number of positive cases as these results come through. ""The actions and measures that have been put in place will help to prevent any further spread of infection and we hope to see the numbers of positive cases tail off over the coming days.""
