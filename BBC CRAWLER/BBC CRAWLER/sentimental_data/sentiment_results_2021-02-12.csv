"Immigration officials have not received guidance on how England's hotel quarantine system will work, less than three days before it is due to launch, a union says. The Immigration Services Union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. From Monday arrivals from 33 countries will have to quarantine in hotels. The government said staff were supported on how to apply new guidance. A spokeswoman added that Border Force operational guidance was ""constantly updated to reflect the ever changing environment"". The requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from so-called ""red-list"" countries -  including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - which are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants. It will cost Â£1,750 for an individual. From these high-risk countriesthe government says travellers can arrive in England at five airports,external- Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough. In Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels. When will lockdown rules be reviewed? What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine How England's hotel quarantine will differ from Australia's Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said officers still had questions about what to do with arrivals from ""red-list"" countries and whether they should chase someone if they ran away while being checked. ""They have had no operational instructions so far at all and we do not know for certain when they will receive them,"" she said. ""We know that passengers will be required to state in their passenger locator form whether they have been in a red-listed country, but the officers have been given no indication about how far they should inquire about the content of the form."" She also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. ""Officers are currently spending 15 to 20 minutes interacting with each passenger. They only have a Perspex screen, no masks or gloves to protect them,"" she said. ""That's not enough and if that interaction has to be longer there is a concern of an increased risk."" Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was not good enough that Border Force staff still did not know how the system would work at airports, including whether high-risk arrivals would be taken straight to hotels or would have to queue with other travellers. ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be super-spreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" she said. International travel is currently banned, other than fora small number of permitted reasons,external, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We are taking decisive action at the borders and every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the Passenger Locator Form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK.""

Meanwhile, the website where travellers can book quarantine hotel rooms and new mandatory tests has reopened,after it was hit by technical issues. The site,externalwas taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by Friday afternoon. It comes asBBC analysis found England's quarantine system might turn out to be less stringent than Australia's scheme, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggests: Guests will be allowed access to fresh air outside, escorted by a security guard, whereas in Australia the view is that staff should not be put at risk by escorting people outside There is no guidance on the timing of meal deliveries, potentially leading to cross-infections between guests as room doors are opened at the same time Surgical masks will be required for staff, providing less protection than the masks required in Australia's system The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were in line with those in other countries and staff would be able to access regular testing as well as appropriate personal protective equipment. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources have confirmed reports that countries can be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures,external. 39 WAYS TO SAVE THE PLANET:Tom Heap offers up fresh and fascinating ideas to cut carbon ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL?:Learn new things with Greg James and Bella Mackie from Britain's most inspiring teachers Will you be travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" country?

"Mark Drakeford said they were talking to the Welsh tourist industry ""about what might be possible around the Easter period"" ""Cautious"" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter have started, the first minister said. But Mark Drakeford said the sector - which supports 10% of the Welsh workforce or 120,000 jobs - would not be opened ""in one go"". Although he did not rule it out, Mr Drakeford also suggested it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April. He said a revised plan out of lockdown would be published ""within days"". The Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". Wales 'first in UK to hit' February vaccine target Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ministers were talking to the Welsh tourist industry, worth Â£6.3bn to the Welsh economy, ""about what might be possible around the Easter period"". Wales' lockdownis set to be reviewed on 19 February and the first minister said it was all ""very much caveated"" and dependant on Covid infection rates and variants of the virus. Tourism bosses are keen to see resorts such as Llandudno in north Wales reopen to visitors Mr Drakeford said if progress against Covid continued, the authorities could ""slowly and cautiously"" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter ""in all aspects of our lives"". Currently, all indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions, non-essential shops, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation are shut. Three to seven-year-old childrenwill be able to return to school in Walesfrom 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses. The potential phased reopening of schools for the remainder of primary age children and college students will be the priority at the next three-week Covid lockdown review - and Mr Drakeford said there would only be room for some other ""modest"" changes at most. This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the success of the vaccine rollout is due to the ""phenomenal effort"" of all involved. Asked whether the return of more pupils to face-to-face teaching would be his government's priority for the following review on 12 March, the first minister said ""schools will remain our top priority"" if there was ""further headroom available to us"". ""But, of course, there are other things we know that matter a great deal to people and if we were in a position safely to do anything else to lift the restrictions that is what we would do,"" Mr Drakeford added. The first minister said he ""absolutely"" understood the need to give the tourism industry ""some forward notice"" if a partial reopening was allowed for the Easter break. Tourists returned to Llandudno in the summer, despite the pandemic But he said: ""Nobody should think that what we're talking about here is the wholesale reopening of the tourist industry in one go."" Asked if that meant it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would also be open at Easter, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't want to rule things out quite in that way. ""The way we'll have to do it will be step by step, using what headroom we have, never doing too many things that put us back in danger. ""It will not be safe to lift restrictions over too many things all at once. That means prioritising things."" The first minister said the Welsh Government's ""cautious approach"" would likely focus on the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation in the first instance. Mr Drakeford saidÂ anyoneÂ booking a holiday should do so ""knowing theÂ uncertain world that we are living in and that there are no guarantees"". The chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance called on the UK and Welsh governments to work together as ""80% of our tourism market is across the border in England"". Italianate style village Portmeirion in Gwynedd is a popular attraction Andrew Campbell said there was an ""awful lot of planning"" needed before reopening as ""you don't just turn a switch on"". ""There's always been cautious optimism that we could get going again in April, but Easter would be simply wonderful,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales ""If we go and open and England are still in lockdown that will cause problems - we need to have those discussions,"" Mr Campbell added. Llandudno hotel owner Lynette Esposito said she had been getting a ""substantial number of new inquiries"" Lynette Esposito, owner of the Elm Tree hotel in Llandudno, said she felt ""optimistic"" after the first minister's comments. But she said coming out of lockdown for Welsh businesses should be ""aligned with England"" as that accounted for ""the bulk of their business"". ""I think in terms of a timeline it is critical we are being given sufficient time, for us to be able to get the place cleaned up and start trade,"" she said. She added she thought it would be useful for hospitality staff to get ""some advantage as to getting a vaccine"" as they would be ""frontline people reopening the economy"". Ms Esposito said they had been seeing a ""substantial number of new inquiries"" from people who had never visited Wales before. ""There is no doubt there is demand out there, but people are still cautious,"" she said. The BBCÂ Holidays at HomeÂ show declared Three Cliffs Bay Britain's best beach in 2006 Meanwhile, the Three Cliffs Holiday Park in the Gower has seen a surge in bookings after the first minister's ""positive outlook for this summer"". ""It's lovely to have so much enthusiasm,"" said owner Tom Beynon. Well, a number of figures need to continue fall - namely average case rates, test positivity rates and Covid hospital patient numbers. Wales currently has the lowest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, with a seven-day average of 102 cases per 100,000 - a dramatic fall from before Christmas, where it had the highest in the UK with 603. The number of hospital patients in Wales was at record levels at the start of January - now it is at its lowest daily average since 20 December. Covid positivity rate in Wales now stands at 8.7% - its lowest point since 8 October. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the proportion of positive tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions. The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) has issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance. In its latest report it said if restrictions were lifted ""too early or too quickly"", there was a ""high likelihood of returning to current levels of infections and hospitalisations in those scenarios"". It said thereproduction (R) numbercontinues to be within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9 - it has been within this range for a few weeks and is down from the period just after Christmas when it was between 0.8 and 1.1. It means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales about seven people would become infected. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". He said: ""As we hit these important vaccination milestones and with the latest review due at the end of next week, it's important ministers now devise a roadmap out of lockdown, providing timescales where possible and appropriate for schools, families, workers and businesses."" Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said any easing would not happen quickly, adding: ""What we don't want to do is have a rapid opening up and a rapid resurgence of the virus."" On Thursday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was""too early""to know whether summer holidays could go ahead, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to urge the UK Government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce a""gradual and phased""plan out of lockdown for England on 22 February.

"This video can not be played Camila Batmanghelidjh: ""I am delighted that the justice system paid attention to the facts"" The founder and former trustees of the collapsed charity Kids Company have won a High Court battle against being disqualified from other organisations. The Official Receiver argued they were ""unfit"" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity. But the ruling cleared former chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh and the seven others of personal wrongdoing. The judge added the charity may have survived had it not been for unfounded allegations of criminal activity. A plan to restructure the organisation's finances had been agreed with David Cameron's government. But the charity closed its doors in 2015 after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations, following the broadcast of a BBC Newsnight report. The police investigationconcluded in 2016 after finding no evidence of criminality. In her ruling,,externalMrs Justice Falk said the charity, which worked with hundreds of vulnerable children in London and Bristol, may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed. During the lengthy court battle, the Official Receiver - a body that looks into potential wrongdoing by company directors - had alleged that the charity's former leaders should be disqualified as directors because the organisation had been so badly run. In the run-up to its collapse, the charity was spending around Â£20m a year, up to a quarter of which came from the government. The Official Receiver alleged that Kids Company's business model had become unsustainable from around September 2013 and its failure was inevitable. It also alleged that the defendants knew or ought to have known that and should have planned to avoid financial collapse. The charity's chairman at the time of its collapse, who was also cleared by the ruling, was the former BBC executive Alan Yentob. Mrs Justice Falk said the case was not proven. ""There was no allegation of dishonesty, bad faith or personal gain,"" said the judge. ""There was no allegation of inappropriate expenditure in relation to any of the children assisted by Kids Company. ""The allegation is not made out against any of the directors and they are not unfit. The case against them fails. ""While aspects of the charity's work were high-risk, the business model was not unsustainable."" Mrs Justice Falk said the charity had grown rapidly from its south London base as demand for its specialist support services for vulnerable children grew. Despite having a substantial and stable government grant, it also needed to raise additional funds from private donors - and by 2015 it was in talks with Whitehall over how to do that amid concerns about its cash flow and staff costs. ""That restructuring plan was agreed and a further government grant was awarded,"" said the judge. ""However the charity was forced to close after sexual assault allegations [the same week]. The charity was exonerated following a police investigation - but by that time it was too late. ""Had it not been for those unfounded allegations, it is more likely than not that the restructuring would have succeeded and the charity would have survived."" The judge described the people running the charity as a ""group of highly impressive and dedicated individuals who selflessly gave enormous amounts of their time to what was clearly a highly challenging trusteeship"". In a statement after the ruling, Ms Batmanghelidjh, who founded Kids Company in 1996, said: ""I hope this judgement will be the first step in refuting the many lies that have been told and banishing the false myths. ""My regret is that many thousands of children whom we supported were left unassisted and vulnerable once our service was withdrawn and that there were many others who never got a chance to receive help."" Speaking on the BBC News Channel, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the ruling was ""justice"" for the ""thousands of staff, volunteers and donors who created Kids Company over nearly 20 years"". But she said Kids Company would not have had to ""carry that burden of child protection if the child protection system in this country was fit for purpose"". A statement issued on behalf of former trustees said: ""Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible. ""We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law.""

"France has administered close to 2.8m jabs (file photo) France's health authority is recommending that anyone previously infected with Covid-19 should only receive one vaccine jab, instead of the normal two doses. People who recover from Covid have some immunity and should be inoculated three-six months afterwards, it said. France is the first country to issue this advice. It has delivered nearly 2.8 million vaccinations so far, the health ministry said. ""The single vaccine dose will thus play the role of a booster"" for someone previously infected with coronavirus, the Haute AutoritÃ© de SantÃ© (HAS) said. The recommendation comes as governments around the world are rushing to vaccinate their populations and try to return life to normal. At least 3.4 million people in France have had confirmed Covid-19 infections but the true figure is thought to be higher. Around 81,000 people have died -  the seventh-highest figure in the world. France's inoculation programme began in December but is lagging behind that of other countries like Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the UK. The three main vaccines used globally are administered in two doses, delivered several weeks apart. Coronavirus vaccines: How's my country and the rest of the world doing? Africa's long wait for the Covid-19 vaccine What's the problem with the EU vaccine rollout? But HAS said that four studies suggest that a single dose in someone who has recovered from coronavirus produces a sufficient immune response to protect against further infection. ""People who have already been infected retain an immune memory,""HAS said in a press release,external. ""The single dose of vaccine will thus act as a booster."" The agency has not said how this recommendation could be acted on or how France would identify who has already contracted Covid-19 and when. People with suppressed immune systems should still receive two doses, the agency added. Vaccines work by mimicking the infection that they are designed to protect against. They teach the body how to recognise and fight the real disease. But it can take time for the immune system to learn this lesson and, often, a booster shot is needed to create a lasting immune memory. It's reasonable to assume people who have already caught and recovered from coronavirus will have some of this immune memory. Scientists think that memory could, perhaps, be sufficiently reawakened with a single shot of vaccine. A couple of studies have already looked at this - giving a single dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine to people known to have had coronavirus in the past. In both of these studies, the vaccine appeared to work well, prompting their immune systems to quickly make lots of antibodies against the virus. The large quantities seen suggest their body was already ""primed"" by the natural infection to respond. More studies are needed to confirm this, but it might be one way to free up extra vaccine doses to share around the world. Confirming which people have definitely had coronavirus takes time and tests, however. Pragmatically, it may still be simpler and faster to give everyone two doses, as already recommended. On Friday French Health Minister Olivier Veran visited the region of Moselle in eastern France where highly-contagious new variants of Covid-19 are spreading. Strains first detected in Brazil and South Africa account for 4% to 5% of all new cases registered in France and can still be contained, he said on Thursday. A mutation first identified in the UK accounts for 25% of new infections. Will vaccines always work against Covid? On Friday the chief scientist for the World Health Organization Soumya Swaminathan said there were reports of people being re-infected with new strains. Pharmaceutical companies have said that tweaks to existing vaccines should make the jabs work against mutations of the virus and that booster jabs will probably be necessary in the future.

"Justin Timberlake dated Britney Spears for several years, breaking up in 2002 Justin Timberlake has apologised to Britney Spears after a new documentary led to criticism of how he treated her during and after their relationship. Framing Britney Spears featured archive clips of Timberlake discussing his sexual relationship with the singer. In a statementon Instagram,externalon Friday, Timberlake said he was ""deeply sorry"" and wanted to ""take accountability"". He also apologised to Janet Jackson, after failing to support her over their controversial Super Bowl performance. Timberlake and Spears dated between 1999 and 2002, while he was a member of boy band N*Sync. After their split, he indirectly accused her of cheating on him when he hired a lookalike actress to appear in the video for his single Cry Me A River. ""I've seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism. ""I specifically want to apologise to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed. I also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be part of and grow from. ""The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success. It's designed this way. As a man in a privileged position I have to be vocal about this. Because of my ignorance, I didn't recognise it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life but I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again. ""I have not been perfect in navigating all of this throughout my career. I know this apology is a first step and doesn't absolve the past. I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this as well as be part of a world that uplifts and supports. I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better."" After finding fame at the end of the 1990s, Spears said she was waiting until she was married to lose her virginity. But during a radio interview, a clip of which features in the documentary, Timberlake publicly revealed that they had slept together. Timberlake was a guest performer in Janet's Super Bowl half-time show Two years later, at the 2004 Super Bowl, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson, accidentally exposing her breast. The ""wardrobe malfunction"", as it became known, led to outcry and complaints from viewers. Although both apologised, Jackson absorbed the bulk of the negative publicity. She was fined and blacklisted by US radio and MTV, and Timberlake's failure to publicly support her was heavily criticised in later years. Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Britney Spears' father must share financial power Britney 'taking time to be a normal person' Interest in Spears has been renewed by the release of the New York Times documentary, which examines how Spears has been treated throughout her career. It has led to criticism of Timberlake and other figures including journalist Diane Sawyer, who told Spears during a 2003 interview she had ""disappointed a lot of mothers"", and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, who was involved in the coverage of her 2007 breakdown. The film also goes into detail about the singer's conservatorship, a legal arrangement that has given her father Jamie Spears control over her career and financial affairs since 2008. However on Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer, and rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments.

"Ten people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of members from different households Pubs and restaurants in Jersey will be allowed to reopen for table service only from 22 February, the government has announced. Up to 10 people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of people from different households. Customers must have a substantial meal and a social distance of 2m (6ft) must be kept between tables. Further relaxations to Covid restrictions will begin next week, the government said. From next Wednesday, faith groups will be allowed to meet for worship in groups of up to 40 people. Controlled outdoor sports gatherings can also restart from Wednesday for up to 35 people under 18 and from 8 March for up to 35 people over 18. From 22 February, any pubs that cannot serve food must remain closed, the government said. Last orders at those that can reopen must be placed by 22:00 GMT and masks must be worn at all times except when eating and drinking. Rules on household gatherings will remain unchanged, with islandersbanned from mixing with others in their homes. Chief minister, Senator John Le FondrÃ©, said the current levels of infection in the island showed it was safe to continue reopening group activities ""carefully and with mitigation measures in place"". He said: ""Risks remain though, which is why we are not opening up too quickly and why we are not yet relaxing our travel arrivals policy.""

"A deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended to the end of May. Covid-related delays meant more than 16,000 sales were at risk, with buyers facing large bills were purchases to fall through at the last minute. Construction of newly-built homes, which qualify for the scheme, have been put back by as much as eight months. Some buyers are worried that the new, two-month extended deadline will still come too soon. In seven years, the Help to Buy equity loan scheme has allowed 278,000 households to receive an advance from the government to help pay the deposit to buy a newly-built home. The scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England. However, data from Homes England obtained through a BBC Freedom of Information request showed that, as of the end of January, there were 16,691 sales still to be completed under the current scheme. In many cases, construction workers have needed to self-isolate, supply lines have slowed, overseas labour may have needed to quarantine, and some traders have been furloughed. Most buyers 'did not need' Help to Buy Buyers face losing thousands of pounds if their properties are not built in time. The government's extension to the deadline - the latest of three - gives homebuilders an extra two months to complete developments. It means that purchases can be completed by the end of May. ""This measure provides certainty to developers to build out homes delayed and further protects customers whose purchases have been delayed by Covid-19,"" a spokesman for Homes England said. He added the move was aimed to ensure ""those buying a home through the scheme are not disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control"". Greg Saunders said the new deadline was a relief Greg Saunders, 31, who is buying with his boyfriend David Leith, 36,told the BBC in Januarythat their purchase was in doubt owing to the delays. Mr Saunders said no blame was attached to the builders who had done their best in the circumstances caused by the pandemic - but missing the deadline would have ruined their hopes of a new dream home and cost them about Â£2,000 in solicitor fees. Now, following the government's latest announcement, he said: ""It's a huge relief. It has helped me and my partner and so many other people. ""This is great news and it is good that the government is listening but this still won't help everyone. I don't think the extension until the end of May quite reflects the true scale of the delays facing developers at the moment."" Andrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco mortgage brokers, said: ""While Homes England have told developers there will be no more extensions, this should give builders some much needed breathing space to fully complete the property and ensure that their buyers do not miss out. ""It will be interesting to see whether or not this extension sets the scene for something similar to happen withthe stamp duty holiday."" The Help to Buy scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England and is being replaced by a less generous version restricted to first-time buyers which starts for new applicants at the beginning in April. Stefanie Weingarth and Carl Young still have concerns Stefanie Weingarth, 29, and Carl Young, 32, had agreed in October to buy a house near Didcot in Oxfordshire, with the help of a Â£112,000 Help to Buy loan. The house was supposed to be completed in late February - but Covid-related delays mean the build is at least six to eight weeks behind. Ms Weingarth said: ""It's great news that the government have extended the deadline. Our developers are pretty certain they'll have our home ready in time now. We're hoping to move in mid April. It's our first family home and we wouldn't be able to afford it without the current Help to Buy scheme."" She already owns a property, so the couple would be ineligible for the new scheme which is restricted to first-time buyers. The only sticking point now is that the couple will not be able to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, one of the reasons they decided to buy together in the first place. The tax break deadline is the end of March. As their property will not be ready until April, they now face the prospect of trying to find an extra Â£15,000 for stamp duty. ""It seems unfair for the government to acknowledge that there are construction days, so extend Help to Buy, but not extend stamp duty for us,"" said Ms Weingarth.

"The ONS said hairdressing was one sector that recovered lost ground in December The UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show. The contraction in 2020 ""was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. However, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year. In December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased. Hospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said. This video can not be played Cancellor Rishi Sunak says the GDP slump is ""comparable to other countries"" The growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s. A double-dip is when the economy briefly recovers from recession, only to quickly sink back. A recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters where the economy contracts. What is GDP and why does it matter? Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries? ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""An increase in Covid-19 testing and tracing also boosted output. The economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter as a whole, despite the additional [lockdown] restrictions in November."" GDP was first measured in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the measure has never previously dropped by more than 4.1% in a year. However, the Bank of England models GDP going back centuries, and the 2020 contraction could be the worse since 1709. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Despite avoiding a double-dip recession, with output still well below pre-pandemic levels amid confirmation that 2020 was a historically bleak year for the UK economy, there is little to cheer in the latest data."" All four economic sectors tracked by the ONS saw a drop in output, with the highest fall coming in the construction sector, which contracted by 12.5%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that last year our economy experienced a significant shock, and also some signs of resilience over winter. ""You know what's clear is right now, many families and businesses are experiencing hardship. That's why we've put in place a comprehensive plan for jobs to support people through this crisis, and we will set out the next stage of our economic response at our Budget in early March."" Economy like a coiled spring, says Bank economist But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""These figures confirm that not only has the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, we're experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy. ""Businesses can't wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions."" However, Mr Sunak said international economic comparisons were not necessarily a useful yardstick. ""We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else. And if you either correct for that difference or look at it in a way that's more comfortable with nominal GDP, what you find, as the Bank of England and the ONS have pointed out, is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries."" Economists said that with Covid-19 restrictions expected to remain until early spring, the hit to the economy will continue over the next few months. ""We anticipate a sharp decline in activity during the first quarter of the year,"" said Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme."" As expected the economy stabilised in the last quarter of 2020. But the latest set of statistics confirm the scale of the hit over the whole of last year. A technical return to recession has been avoided, with the economy returning to growth at the end of last year. But the economy is certainly falling again so far in the first three months of 2021, due to the tough national lockdowns, as well as some impact from increased trade barriers with the European Union. The chancellor and Bank of England will be paying much more attention to what is going on right now. The renewed lockdown has hit growth considerably again, but not as hard as last April. Businesses and households remain in holding pattern ready to unleash pent up growth when the economy is reopened. While the vaccine will eventually unlock that growth, the precise timing is still uncertain, and the government remains under pressure to maintain significant sums in economic support. Last year's contraction is steeper than almost any other big economy, although Spain suffered an 11% decline. Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head of population. Much of the damage to the UK economy is attributed by economists to a high dependence on the service sector, which suffered particularly badly during the year because of lockdown. However, Britain has vaccinated many more people than other European countries so far, raising the prospect of a bounce-back for its economy later this year. That potential fast rebound prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to describe the economy as like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"". Andy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring. Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""There are reasons for cautious optimism, because the vaccine roll-out is going really well. ""The prime minister will set out a roadmap for exiting restrictions in the next few weeks and months. It will be the week of February, 22nd, and it's related that we base our roadmap on the best possible evidence of data."" Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries?

"Ten people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of members from different households Pubs and restaurants in Jersey will be allowed to reopen for table service only from 22 February, the government has announced. Up to 10 people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of people from different households. Customers must have a substantial meal and a social distance of 2m (6ft) must be kept between tables. Further relaxations to Covid restrictions will begin next week, the government said. From next Wednesday, faith groups will be allowed to meet for worship in groups of up to 40 people. Controlled outdoor sports gatherings can also restart from Wednesday for up to 35 people under 18 and from 8 March for up to 35 people over 18. From 22 February, any pubs that cannot serve food must remain closed, the government said. Last orders at those that can reopen must be placed by 22:00 GMT and masks must be worn at all times except when eating and drinking. Rules on household gatherings will remain unchanged, with islandersbanned from mixing with others in their homes. Chief minister, Senator John Le FondrÃ©, said the current levels of infection in the island showed it was safe to continue reopening group activities ""carefully and with mitigation measures in place"".

"Donald Trump's lawyers have finished making their case for his innocence He is accused of causing, over many months and then on 6 January, a deadly insurrection at Congress The riot was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified ""You can't incite what was already going to happen"" said his lawyer who said the attack was pre-planned Trump was exercising freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent, his legal team said And they accused Democrats of hypocrisy, playing an 11-minute video of them using the word ""fight"" On Thursday Democrats said Trump had shown no remorse and could do the same again They had earlier presented previously unseen footage of the rioters inside the Capitol building Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Jessica Murphy Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of day four of the impeachment trial. What could be the final day of proceedings begins tomorrow at10:00 EST/15:00 GMT- and we'll be back here for it. You can catch up on the latest here. Some of the key moments from today:  Today's editors and writers were Tom Spender, Jessica Murphy, Tom Geoghegan, Ashitha Nagesh, Sam Cabral, and Ritu Prasad. The trial has ended for today and it went rather speedily. Over the course of the day, we saw the Trump legal team present its case and both sides undergo a question-and-answer session with their jurors in the Senate. Barring a request for more witnesses, the only thing left in the trial is the closing arguments. Tomorrow - likely the trial's final day - resumes at10:00 EST (15:00 GMT). The question and answer session has just wrapped. Another order of business is now presented by leader Chuck Schumer: awarding a congressional gold medal to Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer lauded as a hero. This is met with loud applause from the chamber. Schumer says it's not just Goodman, but all of the law enforcement officials who worked to protect lawmakers. ""Let us give them all the honour and recognition they so justly deserve."" More applause follows. Before they vote on awarding that medal, Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell also gives a short speech thanking officer Goodman in particular, and others. If not for him, McConnell says, ""people in this chamber may not have escaped unharmed. Officer Goodman's actions reflect a deep personal commitment to duty"".

Hosted by our correspondents Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis, the latest episode dives into the central question of this week's impeachment trial: did Trump's language incite the riots at the Capitol? To do that, they spoke to Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who publicly warned people could end up dead because of Trump's false election claims. You can listen and subscribe to Americast on the free BBC Sounds app, which is available worldwide. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Most people enjoy a Friday night beverage of wine or beer, but here on the Senate Floor, Senator Romney is ringing in the weekend with a cold glass of chocolate milk. And it was quite a thirst quencher for him as he chugged it. Quickly! Milk and water are actually the only two drinks allowed on the Senate floor. Since senators spend so much time talking, they are more prone to a dry mouth, which is why water is allowed. In a filibuster though, where Senators can talk for hours at a time as a stalling tactic, they need more than water to get through. So, there is an exception in ""Riddick's Senate Procedure,"" a compendium of guidelines written by a former Senate parliamentarian that allow milk on the Senate floor. A question from Louisiana Republican Senator Cassidy notes that by 14:15 on 6 January, Trump should have been aware of the riot. But he then tweeted that Pence ""lacked courage"" and did not call for law enforcement. So did Trump not care that Pence was in danger, Cassidy asks? Trump's lawyer Van der Veen responds first. He says he disputes the ""premise of the facts laid out in that question"" ""Unfortunately, we're not going to know the answer to the facts in this proceeding because the House did nothing to investigate what was going on."" Van der Veen adds: ""I have no idea and nobody from the House has given us any opportunity to have any idea but Mr Trump and Mr Pence have had a very good relationship for a long time."" He's sure, therefore, that Trump was concerned for Pence and everyone else in the Capitol. Lead manager Raskin takes the question for the prosecution. ""[Trump's] counsel keep blaming the House for not having the evidence that's within the sole possession of their client, who we invited to testify last week,"" Raskin argues. He says the former president was invited to explain what happened, but House managers received a ""contemptuous response"". ""Rather than yelling at us,"" Raskin concludes, ""bring your client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending out tweets denouncing the vice-president while the vice-president was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him."" This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world Senators have four hours to ask questions of the two sides in this trial. And we are now into the second hour. So far, most Democratic Senators have asked questions of the House impeachment managers - from their party - and most Republican Senators have asked questions of the Trump defence team - representing the former leader of their party. A few questions - particularly the ones posed to both sides - have seen fiery exchanges between the two legal teams. But the Q&A portion looks unlikely to change many minds and the trial is quickly heading toward a conclusion. Once this session ends, the two sides will make their closing arguments and then vote on whether Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection or not. Senators Ted Cruz, left, and Lindsey Graham, right Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee paid a visit to the Trump defence team yesterday and today, US media report. The meetings have drawn some criticism from across the aisle as senators are meant to be impartial jurors in an impeachment trial.  Allow Twitter content?

Sources told CNN and the Washington Post they have been advising them on their legal approach. According to the Post,external, David Schoen - one of the attorneys - said they spoke about ""how this format goes, you know, the question-and-answer period, all that... and then just talking about where theyâre from and all that"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A question about whether Trump actually won the election gives House impeachment manager Barbara Plaskett a chance to talk about how politicians of all stripes have to learn how to lose elections - and most do so gracefully. ""I lost my first election. I stayed in bed for three days,"" she said. ""We do what we need to do and we move on."" The question gave Trump attorney Bruce Castor a chance to attack the questioner, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""Who asked that question?"" asked the lawyer, to groans from Senate Democrats. His own opinion, said Castor, was irrelevant. The issue before the Senate was whether Trump incited an insurrection. And the Trump team's answer was he didnât. It looks like the final vote to convict or acquit could come on Saturday. The Democrats have an uphill battle persuading 17 Republicans to join them in exercising the ultimate sanction on a (former) president. Here are some of the senators to watch. Why Mitt Romney? Because he is a Trump critic and expected to convict Why Mitch McConnell? Because he knows the mood of his party better than anyone Why Bill Cassidy? Because he backed Democrats in advancing the case to trial Why Lisa Murkowski? Because the Alaska senator could also vote against Trump Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins just posed one of the more interesting queries â to both sides â so far during the trialâs four-hour question time. When Donald Trump sent a disparaging tweet about Mike Pence, they asked, did he know that the vice-president had been removed from the Senate chamber by Secret Service for his safety? Answering for the impeachment managers, Congressman Joaquin Castro said that the president must have known that Pence was being threatened by the mob. The violence was being broadcast on national television, the White House has the extensive communications facilities and the president himself had just been informed by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville that Pence had been evacuated during a phone conversation the two had at roughly the same time. Responding for Trumpâs defence, lawyer Michael van der Bleen said Trump did not know. He added that the House Democrats had done no investigation into the matter during their ârushedâ impeachment proceedings and, besides, Trumpâs actions during the Capitol riot were not included in the impeachment article, which dealt with inciting an insurrection. The question - from two Republicans who are likely to vote to convict - gets to the heart of the case against the former president. Did Trumpâs actions during the riot - including his condemnation of Pence - indicate that he knew that violence was likely and that he welcomed and encouraged them? The House impeachment managers insist the answer is yes. On Tuesday, Lousiana Senator Bill Cassidy was one of only six Republicans who voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial. He explained to reporters that House impeachment managers had made a persuasive case on Tuesday - day one of the trial - and he wanted to hear them out. But, as our correspondent Jon Sopel notes, it looks like Cassidy has since made up his mind that Donald Trump should be acquitted in this trial. Or has he? His office told CNN that Cassidy remains undecided âand is reviewing memos from both points of view as part of his thought process before coming to a conclusionâ. Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Paige Harding, a Republican supporting college student in Lawrence, Kansas, sees both trials - the impeachment of Trump from a year ago and the one today - as a waste of time. Still, her view of impeachment has changed, in one sense. She does not believe Trump will run for office again, and so he is no longer an issue. As a University of Kansas senior, she thinks members of Congress should instead focus on the economy. âIâd rather have them spend their time helping to make sure I can get a job when I graduate,â she told me. Other Midwesterners share her views, saying both impeachments were unnecessary. âNo new facts have emerged,â says David Kensinger, a political operative in Topeka, Kansas, describing the current proceedings. âSeems like largely a non-event.â For Harvey Joe Sanner, a farmer in Arkansas, though, the most frustrating thing about the two impeachments has been the following: the Senators do not have enough votes to convict. âTrump is guilty as hell,â Sanner says. Yet the impeachments have failed. âItâs just a matter of politics,â he says. âAnd thatâs very unfortunate.â And so it begins. Answers are limited to five minutes each (if the question is directed to both counsel and House prosecutors, the time will be split). Democratic leader Senator Chuck Schumer is first to submit a question on behalf of himself and Senator Feinstein. He asks the impeachment managers: ""Isn't it the case that the violent attack and seige on the Capitol on January 6th would not have happened if not for the conduct of President Trump?"" ""To answer your question very directly, Donald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled the mob and he lit the flame,"" answers Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro. ""Everything that followed was because of his doing. And though he could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, he never did."" The senators are back. Now comes the period of questioning. Senators aren't allowed to ask their own questions aloud - instead, they submit them in writing to Senator Leahy, who is presiding over the session, and then he has his clerk read them out. Our reporter Samantha Granville, who is in the Senate chamber today, says sources do not believe the full four hours will be used. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Bill Cassidy was seen taking notes Republican senators have been criticised this week for not paying full
attention during the impeachment managers' presentations, and coming and
going as they pleased throughout the last two days. At one point yesterday
there were 15 empty Republican seats. Today though, only three Republican seats were empty and the members of the party
seemed much more attentive. Senator Cassidy was taking good notes, and Senator Rand Paul chuckled when
the video of Maxine Waters challenging Electoral College results played. Meanwhile, Democrats on the other side of the chamber were mostly silent
during the video - aside from a few whispers here and there. Senator Elizabeth
Warren, who made many cameos in it, seemed to just stare ahead, grasping her pen tightly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

These will be answered on the Senate floor over the coming four hours. There will then be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Assuming there are no witnesses, as both Republicans and Democrats are said to favour a speedy trial, we could see a vote on conviction as early as tomorrow - a month to the day Trump after was impeached by the House.

"Donald Trump's lawyers have finished making their case for his innocence He is accused of causing, over many months and then on 6 January, a deadly insurrection at Congress The riot was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified ""You can't incite what was already going to happen"" said his lawyer who said the attack was pre-planned Trump was exercising freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent, his legal team said And they accused Democrats of hypocrisy, playing an 11-minute video of them using the word ""fight"" On Thursday Democrats said Trump had shown no remorse and could do the same again They had earlier presented previously unseen footage of the rioters inside the Capitol building Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Jessica Murphy Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of day four of the impeachment trial. What could be the final day of proceedings begins tomorrow at10:00 EST/15:00 GMT- and we'll be back here for it. You can catch up on the latest here. Some of the key moments from today:  Today's editors and writers were Tom Spender, Jessica Murphy, Tom Geoghegan, Ashitha Nagesh, Sam Cabral, and Ritu Prasad. The trial has ended for today and it went rather speedily. Over the course of the day, we saw the Trump legal team present its case and both sides undergo a question-and-answer session with their jurors in the Senate. Barring a request for more witnesses, the only thing left in the trial is the closing arguments. Tomorrow - likely the trial's final day - resumes at10:00 EST (15:00 GMT). The question and answer session has just wrapped. Another order of business is now presented by leader Chuck Schumer: awarding a congressional gold medal to Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer lauded as a hero. This is met with loud applause from the chamber. Schumer says it's not just Goodman, but all of the law enforcement officials who worked to protect lawmakers. ""Let us give them all the honour and recognition they so justly deserve."" More applause follows. Before they vote on awarding that medal, Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell also gives a short speech thanking officer Goodman in particular, and others. If not for him, McConnell says, ""people in this chamber may not have escaped unharmed. Officer Goodman's actions reflect a deep personal commitment to duty"".

Hosted by our correspondents Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis, the latest episode dives into the central question of this week's impeachment trial: did Trump's language incite the riots at the Capitol?

You can listen and subscribe to Americast on the free BBC Sounds app, which is available worldwide. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Most people enjoy a Friday night beverage of wine or beer, but here on the Senate Floor, Senator Romney is ringing in the weekend with a cold glass of chocolate milk. And it was quite a thirst quencher for him as he chugged it. Quickly! Milk and water are actually the only two drinks allowed on the Senate floor. Since senators spend so much time talking, they are more prone to a dry mouth, which is why water is allowed. In a filibuster though, where Senators can talk for hours at a time as a stalling tactic, they need more than water to get through. So, there is an exception in ""Riddick's Senate Procedure,"" a compendium of guidelines written by a former Senate parliamentarian that allow milk on the Senate floor. A question from Louisiana Republican Senator Cassidy notes that by 14:15 on 6 January, Trump should have been aware of the riot. But he then tweeted that Pence ""lacked courage"" and did not call for law enforcement. So did Trump not care that Pence was in danger, Cassidy asks? Trump's lawyer Van der Veen responds first. He says he disputes the ""premise of the facts laid out in that question"" ""Unfortunately, we're not going to know the answer to the facts in this proceeding because the House did nothing to investigate what was going on."" Van der Veen adds: ""I have no idea and nobody from the House has given us any opportunity to have any idea but Mr Trump and Mr Pence have had a very good relationship for a long time."" He's sure, therefore, that Trump was concerned for Pence and everyone else in the Capitol. Lead manager Raskin takes the question for the prosecution. ""[Trump's] counsel keep blaming the House for not having the evidence that's within the sole possession of their client, who we invited to testify last week,"" Raskin argues. He says the former president was invited to explain what happened, but House managers received a ""contemptuous response"". ""Rather than yelling at us,"" Raskin concludes, ""bring your client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending out tweets denouncing the vice-president while the vice-president was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him."" This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world Senators have four hours to ask questions of the two sides in this trial. And we are now into the second hour. So far, most Democratic Senators have asked questions of the House impeachment managers - from their party - and most Republican Senators have asked questions of the Trump defence team - representing the former leader of their party. A few questions - particularly the ones posed to both sides - have seen fiery exchanges between the two legal teams. But the Q&A portion looks unlikely to change many minds and the trial is quickly heading toward a conclusion. Once this session ends, the two sides will make their closing arguments and then vote on whether Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection or not. Senators Ted Cruz, left, and Lindsey Graham, right Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee paid a visit to the Trump defence team yesterday and today, US media report. The meetings have drawn some criticism from across the aisle as senators are meant to be impartial jurors in an impeachment trial.  Allow Twitter content?

Sources told CNN and the Washington Post they have been advising them on their legal approach. According to the Post,external, David Schoen - one of the attorneys - said they spoke about ""how this format goes, you know, the question-and-answer period, all that... and then just talking about where theyâre from and all that"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A question about whether Trump actually won the election gives House impeachment manager Barbara Plaskett a chance to talk about how politicians of all stripes have to learn how to lose elections - and most do so gracefully. ""I lost my first election. I stayed in bed for three days,"" she said. ""We do what we need to do and we move on."" The question gave Trump attorney Bruce Castor a chance to attack the questioner, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""Who asked that question?"" asked the lawyer, to groans from Senate Democrats. His own opinion, said Castor, was irrelevant. The issue before the Senate was whether Trump incited an insurrection. And the Trump team's answer was he didnât. It looks like the final vote to convict or acquit could come on Saturday. The Democrats have an uphill battle persuading 17 Republicans to join them in exercising the ultimate sanction on a (former) president. Here are some of the senators to watch. Why Mitt Romney? Because he is a Trump critic and expected to convict Why Mitch McConnell? Because he knows the mood of his party better than anyone Why Bill Cassidy? Because he backed Democrats in advancing the case to trial Why Lisa Murkowski? Because the Alaska senator could also vote against Trump Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins just posed one of the more interesting queries â to both sides â so far during the trialâs four-hour question time. When Donald Trump sent a disparaging tweet about Mike Pence, they asked, did he know that the vice-president had been removed from the Senate chamber by Secret Service for his safety? Answering for the impeachment managers, Congressman Joaquin Castro said that the president must have known that Pence was being threatened by the mob. The violence was being broadcast on national television, the White House has the extensive communications facilities and the president himself had just been informed by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville that Pence had been evacuated during a phone conversation the two had at roughly the same time. Responding for Trumpâs defence, lawyer Michael van der Bleen said Trump did not know. He added that the House Democrats had done no investigation into the matter during their ârushedâ impeachment proceedings and, besides, Trumpâs actions during the Capitol riot were not included in the impeachment article, which dealt with inciting an insurrection. The question - from two Republicans who are likely to vote to convict - gets to the heart of the case against the former president. Did Trumpâs actions during the riot - including his condemnation of Pence - indicate that he knew that violence was likely and that he welcomed and encouraged them? The House impeachment managers insist the answer is yes. On Tuesday, Lousiana Senator Bill Cassidy was one of only six Republicans who voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial. He explained to reporters that House impeachment managers had made a persuasive case on Tuesday - day one of the trial - and he wanted to hear them out. But, as our correspondent Jon Sopel notes, it looks like Cassidy has since made up his mind that Donald Trump should be acquitted in this trial. Or has he? His office told CNN that Cassidy remains undecided âand is reviewing memos from both points of view as part of his thought process before coming to a conclusionâ. Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Paige Harding, a Republican supporting college student in Lawrence, Kansas, sees both trials - the impeachment of Trump from a year ago and the one today - as a waste of time. Still, her view of impeachment has changed, in one sense. She does not believe Trump will run for office again, and so he is no longer an issue. As a University of Kansas senior, she thinks members of Congress should instead focus on the economy. âIâd rather have them spend their time helping to make sure I can get a job when I graduate,â she told me. Other Midwesterners share her views, saying both impeachments were unnecessary. âNo new facts have emerged,â says David Kensinger, a political operative in Topeka, Kansas, describing the current proceedings. âSeems like largely a non-event.â For Harvey Joe Sanner, a farmer in Arkansas, though, the most frustrating thing about the two impeachments has been the following: the Senators do not have enough votes to convict. âTrump is guilty as hell,â Sanner says. Yet the impeachments have failed. âItâs just a matter of politics,â he says. âAnd thatâs very unfortunate.â And so it begins. Answers are limited to five minutes each (if the question is directed to both counsel and House prosecutors, the time will be split). Democratic leader Senator Chuck Schumer is first to submit a question on behalf of himself and Senator Feinstein. He asks the impeachment managers: ""Isn't it the case that the violent attack and seige on the Capitol on January 6th would not have happened if not for the conduct of President Trump?"" ""To answer your question very directly, Donald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled the mob and he lit the flame,"" answers Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro. ""Everything that followed was because of his doing. And though he could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, he never did."" The senators are back. Now comes the period of questioning. Senators aren't allowed to ask their own questions aloud - instead, they submit them in writing to Senator Leahy, who is presiding over the session, and then he has his clerk read them out. Our reporter Samantha Granville, who is in the Senate chamber today, says sources do not believe the full four hours will be used. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Bill Cassidy was seen taking notes Republican senators have been criticised this week for not paying full
attention during the impeachment managers' presentations, and coming and
going as they pleased throughout the last two days. At one point yesterday
there were 15 empty Republican seats. Today though, only three Republican seats were empty and the members of the party
seemed much more attentive. Senator Cassidy was taking good notes, and Senator Rand Paul chuckled when
the video of Maxine Waters challenging Electoral College results played. Meanwhile, Democrats on the other side of the chamber were mostly silent
during the video - aside from a few whispers here and there. Senator Elizabeth
Warren, who made many cameos in it, seemed to just stare ahead, grasping her pen tightly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lawmakers have already had the chance to start writing and turning in their questions on notecards. (You can see what these look like in Fox reporter Chad Pergram's tweet below.) These will be answered on the Senate floor over the coming four hours. There will then be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Assuming there are no witnesses, as both Republicans and Democrats are said to favour a speedy trial, we could see a vote on conviction as early as tomorrow - a month to the day Trump after was impeached by the House.

"Justin Timberlake dated Britney Spears for several years, breaking up in 2002 Justin Timberlake has apologised to Britney Spears after a new documentary led to criticism of how he treated her during and after their relationship. Framing Britney Spears featured archive clips of Timberlake discussing his sexual relationship with the singer. In a statementon Instagram,externalon Friday, Timberlake said he was ""deeply sorry"" and wanted to ""take accountability"". He also apologised to Janet Jackson, after failing to support her over their controversial Super Bowl performance. Timberlake and Spears dated between 1999 and 2002, while he was a member of boy band N*Sync. After their split, he indirectly accused her of cheating on him when he hired a lookalike actress to appear in the video for his single Cry Me A River. ""I've seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism. ""I specifically want to apologise to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed. I also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be part of and grow from. ""The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success. It's designed this way. As a man in a privileged position I have to be vocal about this. Because of my ignorance, I didn't recognise it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life but I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again. ""I have not been perfect in navigating all of this throughout my career. I know this apology is a first step and doesn't absolve the past. I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this as well as be part of a world that uplifts and supports. I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better."" After finding fame at the end of the 1990s, Spears said she was waiting until she was married to lose her virginity. But during a radio interview, a clip of which features in the documentary, Timberlake publicly revealed that they had slept together. Timberlake was a guest performer in Janet's Super Bowl half-time show Two years later, at the 2004 Super Bowl, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson, accidentally exposing her breast. The ""wardrobe malfunction"", as it became known, led to outcry and complaints from viewers. Although both apologised, Jackson absorbed the bulk of the negative publicity. She was fined and blacklisted by US radio and MTV, and Timberlake's failure to publicly support her was heavily criticised in later years. Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Britney Spears' father must share financial power Britney 'taking time to be a normal person' Interest in Spears has been renewed by the release of the New York Times documentary, which examines how Spears has been treated throughout her career. It has led to criticism of Timberlake and other figures including journalist Diane Sawyer, who told Spears during a 2003 interview she had ""disappointed a lot of mothers"", and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, who was involved in the coverage of her 2007 breakdown. The film also goes into detail about the singer's conservatorship, a legal arrangement that has given her father Jamie Spears control over her career and financial affairs since 2008. However on Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer, and rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments.

"Immigration officials have not received guidance on how England's hotel quarantine system will work, less than three days before it is due to launch, a union says. The Immigration Services Union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. From Monday arrivals from 33 countries will have to quarantine in hotels. The government said staff were supported on how to apply new guidance. A spokeswoman added that Border Force operational guidance was ""constantly updated to reflect the ever changing environment"". The requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from so-called ""red-list"" countries -  including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - which are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants. It will cost Â£1,750 for an individual. From these high-risk countriesthe government says travellers can arrive in England at five airports,external- Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough. In Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels. When will lockdown rules be reviewed? What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine How England's hotel quarantine will differ from Australia's Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said officers still had questions about what to do with arrivals from ""red-list"" countries and whether they should chase someone if they ran away while being checked. ""They have had no operational instructions so far at all and we do not know for certain when they will receive them,"" she said. ""We know that passengers will be required to state in their passenger locator form whether they have been in a red-listed country, but the officers have been given no indication about how far they should inquire about the content of the form."" She also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. ""Officers are currently spending 15 to 20 minutes interacting with each passenger. They only have a Perspex screen, no masks or gloves to protect them,"" she said. ""That's not enough and if that interaction has to be longer there is a concern of an increased risk."" Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was not good enough that Border Force staff still did not know how the system would work at airports, including whether high-risk arrivals would be taken straight to hotels or would have to queue with other travellers. ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be super-spreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" she said. International travel is currently banned, other than fora small number of permitted reasons,external, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We are taking decisive action at the borders and every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the Passenger Locator Form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK.""

Meanwhile, the website where travellers can book quarantine hotel rooms and new mandatory tests has reopened,after it was hit by technical issues. The site,externalwas taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by Friday afternoon. It comes asBBC analysis found England's quarantine system might turn out to be less stringent than Australia's scheme, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggests: Guests will be allowed access to fresh air outside, escorted by a security guard, whereas in Australia the view is that staff should not be put at risk by escorting people outside There is no guidance on the timing of meal deliveries, potentially leading to cross-infections between guests as room doors are opened at the same time Surgical masks will be required for staff, providing less protection than the masks required in Australia's system The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were in line with those in other countries and staff would be able to access regular testing as well as appropriate personal protective equipment. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources have confirmed reports that countries can be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

""Rather than yelling at us,"" Raskin concludes, ""bring your client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending out tweets denouncing the vice-president while the vice-president was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him."" This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world Senators have four hours to ask questions of the two sides in this trial. And we are now into the second hour. So far, most Democratic Senators have asked questions of the House impeachment managers - from their party - and most Republican Senators have asked questions of the Trump defence team - representing the former leader of their party. A few questions - particularly the ones posed to both sides - have seen fiery exchanges between the two legal teams. But the Q&A portion looks unlikely to change many minds and the trial is quickly heading toward a conclusion. Once this session ends, the two sides will make their closing arguments and then vote on whether Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection or not. Senators Ted Cruz, left, and Lindsey Graham, right Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee paid a visit to the Trump defence team yesterday and today, US media report. The meetings have drawn some criticism from across the aisle as senators are meant to be impartial jurors in an impeachment trial.  Allow Twitter content?

Sources told CNN and the Washington Post they have been advising them on their legal approach. According to the Post,external, David Schoen - one of the attorneys - said they spoke about ""how this format goes, you know, the question-and-answer period, all that... and then just talking about where theyâre from and all that"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A question about whether Trump actually won the election gives House impeachment manager Barbara Plaskett a chance to talk about how politicians of all stripes have to learn how to lose elections - and most do so gracefully. ""I lost my first election. I stayed in bed for three days,"" she said. ""We do what we need to do and we move on."" The question gave Trump attorney Bruce Castor a chance to attack the questioner, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""Who asked that question?"" asked the lawyer, to groans from Senate Democrats. His own opinion, said Castor, was irrelevant. The issue before the Senate was whether Trump incited an insurrection. And the Trump team's answer was he didnât. It looks like the final vote to convict or acquit could come on Saturday. The Democrats have an uphill battle persuading 17 Republicans to join them in exercising the ultimate sanction on a (former) president. Here are some of the senators to watch. Why Mitt Romney? Because he is a Trump critic and expected to convict Why Mitch McConnell? Because he knows the mood of his party better than anyone Why Bill Cassidy? Because he backed Democrats in advancing the case to trial Why Lisa Murkowski? Because the Alaska senator could also vote against Trump Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins just posed one of the more interesting queries â to both sides â so far during the trialâs four-hour question time. When Donald Trump sent a disparaging tweet about Mike Pence, they asked, did he know that the vice-president had been removed from the Senate chamber by Secret Service for his safety? Answering for the impeachment managers, Congressman Joaquin Castro said that the president must have known that Pence was being threatened by the mob. The violence was being broadcast on national television, the White House has the extensive communications facilities and the president himself had just been informed by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville that Pence had been evacuated during a phone conversation the two had at roughly the same time. Responding for Trumpâs defence, lawyer Michael van der Bleen said Trump did not know. He added that the House Democrats had done no investigation into the matter during their ârushedâ impeachment proceedings and, besides, Trumpâs actions during the Capitol riot were not included in the impeachment article, which dealt with inciting an insurrection. The question - from two Republicans who are likely to vote to convict - gets to the heart of the case against the former president. Did Trumpâs actions during the riot - including his condemnation of Pence - indicate that he knew that violence was likely and that he welcomed and encouraged them? The House impeachment managers insist the answer is yes. On Tuesday, Lousiana Senator Bill Cassidy was one of only six Republicans who voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial. He explained to reporters that House impeachment managers had made a persuasive case on Tuesday - day one of the trial - and he wanted to hear them out. But, as our correspondent Jon Sopel notes, it looks like Cassidy has since made up his mind that Donald Trump should be acquitted in this trial. Or has he? His office told CNN that Cassidy remains undecided âand is reviewing memos from both points of view as part of his thought process before coming to a conclusionâ. Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Paige Harding, a Republican supporting college student in Lawrence, Kansas, sees both trials - the impeachment of Trump from a year ago and the one today - as a waste of time. Still, her view of impeachment has changed, in one sense. She does not believe Trump will run for office again, and so he is no longer an issue. As a University of Kansas senior, she thinks members of Congress should instead focus on the economy. âIâd rather have them spend their time helping to make sure I can get a job when I graduate,â she told me. Other Midwesterners share her views, saying both impeachments were unnecessary. âNo new facts have emerged,â says David Kensinger, a political operative in Topeka, Kansas, describing the current proceedings. âSeems like largely a non-event.â For Harvey Joe Sanner, a farmer in Arkansas, though, the most frustrating thing about the two impeachments has been the following: the Senators do not have enough votes to convict. âTrump is guilty as hell,â Sanner says. Yet the impeachments have failed. âItâs just a matter of politics,â he says. âAnd thatâs very unfortunate.â And so it begins. Answers are limited to five minutes each (if the question is directed to both counsel and House prosecutors, the time will be split). Democratic leader Senator Chuck Schumer is first to submit a question on behalf of himself and Senator Feinstein. He asks the impeachment managers: ""Isn't it the case that the violent attack and seige on the Capitol on January 6th would not have happened if not for the conduct of President Trump?"" ""To answer your question very directly, Donald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled the mob and he lit the flame,"" answers Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro. ""Everything that followed was because of his doing. And though he could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, he never did."" The senators are back. Now comes the period of questioning. Senators aren't allowed to ask their own questions aloud - instead, they submit them in writing to Senator Leahy, who is presiding over the session, and then he has his clerk read them out. Our reporter Samantha Granville, who is in the Senate chamber today, says sources do not believe the full four hours will be used. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Bill Cassidy was seen taking notes Republican senators have been criticised this week for not paying full
attention during the impeachment managers' presentations, and coming and
going as they pleased throughout the last two days. At one point yesterday
there were 15 empty Republican seats. Today though, only three Republican seats were empty and the members of the party
seemed much more attentive. Senator Cassidy was taking good notes, and Senator Rand Paul chuckled when
the video of Maxine Waters challenging Electoral College results played. Meanwhile, Democrats on the other side of the chamber were mostly silent
during the video - aside from a few whispers here and there. Senator Elizabeth
Warren, who made many cameos in it, seemed to just stare ahead, grasping her pen tightly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

These will be answered on the Senate floor over the coming four hours. There will then be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Assuming there are no witnesses, as both Republicans and Democrats are said to favour a speedy trial, we could see a vote on conviction as early as tomorrow - a month to the day Trump after was impeached by the House.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At times, Trumpâs defence presentation felt like it was drawn from the conservative media ecosystem that fueled the former presidentâs political rise. The video montages â frequently featuring the same handful of clips packaged in different ways, accompanied by foreboding music and rapidly edited scenes of fire and violence â would seem familiar to regular viewers of evening opinion programmes on Fox News. The clips featured many of the Democratic politicians who have become villains for the right â Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Ayanna Pressley â as well as media figures like CNNâs Chris Cuomo and Hollywood stars such as Madonna and Johnny Depp. Trumpâs defence also used lengthy excerpts of Trump speeches, some of which included attacks on Republicans as well as Democrats to cheering crowds, as if to remind the Republican senators sitting in judgement of the support Trump still enjoys within the Republican Party. It could also be an attempt to shore up that Trump base after two days of attacks from the Democrats. This case isnât just about the law, after all. Itâs about politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A documentary that examined the singer's conservatorship was released last week A judge has denied a request by Britney Spears' father to exert greater control over her finances. Jamie Spears has controlled his daughter's financial affairs since 2008, but the singer has recently indicated she wants him removed. On Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer. The judge rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments. The ruling means Mr Spears and the private trust company, Bessemer Trust, will now have equal power to manage her finances. As a result, he is now expected to work with the company to create a budget and investment proposal for the singer's estate. The conservatorship is a legal arrangement that was put in place because of concerns about her mental health. Los Angeles Judge Brenda Penny appointed Bessemer Trust as co-conservators in November, but rejected the star's effort to remove her father entirely. Fans from the Free Britney campaign gathered outside the court on Thursday Jamie Spears had objected to Bessemer's involvement, arguing that it reduced the power he has held for years. Judge Perry threw out his objection on Thursday. Another hearing is scheduled for 17 March. Britney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III has previously said the singer is ""afraid"" of her father and does not want him to control her finances and career. On Thursday, Mr Ingham reiterated the pop star's wish, adding that it was ""no secret"" she didn't want her father to be a co-conservator, but acknowledged that removing him altogether would be a ""separate issue"". Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Why a court battle is fuelling #FreeBritney calls Interest in the case has been renewed after the recent release of a documentary that focuses on the conflict over the singer's guardianship. Framing Britney Spears, which was produced by The New York Times, examined the conservatorship in depth, as well as how the singer has been treated by the media throughout her career. It also explored the #FreeBritney movement, a campaign by some of the star's fans who believe her life and career are being controlled against her will. Campaigners from the group were outside the hearing on Thursday. Jamie Spears and Britney, pictured in 2006 Babs Gray, host of the BritneyGram podcast, told the BBC outside the court: ""It hasn't changed anything much today... I don't think a lot of forward movement will happen until Britney's lawyer actually files to get her out of the conservatorship."" She said interest in the #FreeBritney issue had ""exploded"" in the past week as a result of the documentary. ""It's been really encouraging to see how supportive everyone is about the movement, how they are reckoning with how Britney was treated in the past,"" she said. ""I hope its not just a flash in the pan. I hope people keep paying attention and keep putting the pressure on."" Britney Spears hasn't performed live for more than two years, and insists she has no intention of doing so again until her father is forced to relinquish control over her career.

"A deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended to the end of May. Covid-related delays meant more than 16,000 sales were at risk, with buyers facing large bills were purchases to fall through at the last minute. Construction of newly-built homes, which qualify for the scheme, have been put back by as much as eight months. Some buyers are worried that the new, two-month extended deadline will still come too soon. In seven years, the Help to Buy equity loan scheme has allowed 278,000 households to receive an advance from the government to help pay the deposit to buy a newly-built home. The scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England. However, data from Homes England obtained through a BBC Freedom of Information request showed that, as of the end of January, there were 16,691 sales still to be completed under the current scheme. In many cases, construction workers have needed to self-isolate, supply lines have slowed, overseas labour may have needed to quarantine, and some traders have been furloughed. Most buyers 'did not need' Help to Buy Buyers face losing thousands of pounds if their properties are not built in time. The government's extension to the deadline - the latest of three - gives homebuilders an extra two months to complete developments. It means that purchases can be completed by the end of May. ""This measure provides certainty to developers to build out homes delayed and further protects customers whose purchases have been delayed by Covid-19,"" a spokesman for Homes England said. He added the move was aimed to ensure ""those buying a home through the scheme are not disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control"". Greg Saunders said the new deadline was a relief Greg Saunders, 31, who is buying with his boyfriend David Leith, 36,told the BBC in Januarythat their purchase was in doubt owing to the delays. Mr Saunders said no blame was attached to the builders who had done their best in the circumstances caused by the pandemic - but missing the deadline would have ruined their hopes of a new dream home and cost them about Â£2,000 in solicitor fees. Now, following the government's latest announcement, he said: ""It's a huge relief. It has helped me and my partner and so many other people. ""This is great news and it is good that the government is listening but this still won't help everyone. I don't think the extension until the end of May quite reflects the true scale of the delays facing developers at the moment."" Andrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco mortgage brokers, said: ""While Homes England have told developers there will be no more extensions, this should give builders some much needed breathing space to fully complete the property and ensure that their buyers do not miss out. ""It will be interesting to see whether or not this extension sets the scene for something similar to happen withthe stamp duty holiday."" The Help to Buy scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England and is being replaced by a less generous version restricted to first-time buyers which starts for new applicants at the beginning in April. Stefanie Weingarth and Carl Young still have concerns Stefanie Weingarth, 29, and Carl Young, 32, had agreed in October to buy a house near Didcot in Oxfordshire, with the help of a Â£112,000 Help to Buy loan. The house was supposed to be completed in late February - but Covid-related delays mean the build is at least six to eight weeks behind. Ms Weingarth said: ""It's great news that the government have extended the deadline. Our developers are pretty certain they'll have our home ready in time now. We're hoping to move in mid April. It's our first family home and we wouldn't be able to afford it without the current Help to Buy scheme."" She already owns a property, so the couple would be ineligible for the new scheme which is restricted to first-time buyers. The only sticking point now is that the couple will not be able to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, one of the reasons they decided to buy together in the first place. The tax break deadline is the end of March. As their property will not be ready until April, they now face the prospect of trying to find an extra Â£15,000 for stamp duty. ""It seems unfair for the government to acknowledge that there are construction days, so extend Help to Buy, but not extend stamp duty for us,"" said Ms Weingarth.

"The ONS said hairdressing was one sector that recovered lost ground in December The UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show. The contraction in 2020 ""was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. However, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year. In December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased. Hospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said. This video can not be played Cancellor Rishi Sunak says the GDP slump is ""comparable to other countries"" The growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s. A double-dip is when the economy briefly recovers from recession, only to quickly sink back. A recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters where the economy contracts. What is GDP and why does it matter? Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries? ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""An increase in Covid-19 testing and tracing also boosted output. The economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter as a whole, despite the additional [lockdown] restrictions in November."" GDP was first measured in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the measure has never previously dropped by more than 4.1% in a year. However, the Bank of England models GDP going back centuries, and the 2020 contraction could be the worse since 1709. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Despite avoiding a double-dip recession, with output still well below pre-pandemic levels amid confirmation that 2020 was a historically bleak year for the UK economy, there is little to cheer in the latest data."" All four economic sectors tracked by the ONS saw a drop in output, with the highest fall coming in the construction sector, which contracted by 12.5%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that last year our economy experienced a significant shock, and also some signs of resilience over winter. ""You know what's clear is right now, many families and businesses are experiencing hardship. That's why we've put in place a comprehensive plan for jobs to support people through this crisis, and we will set out the next stage of our economic response at our Budget in early March."" Economy like a coiled spring, says Bank economist But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""These figures confirm that not only has the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, we're experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy. ""Businesses can't wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions."" However, Mr Sunak said international economic comparisons were not necessarily a useful yardstick. ""We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else. And if you either correct for that difference or look at it in a way that's more comfortable with nominal GDP, what you find, as the Bank of England and the ONS have pointed out, is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries."" Economists said that with Covid-19 restrictions expected to remain until early spring, the hit to the economy will continue over the next few months. ""We anticipate a sharp decline in activity during the first quarter of the year,"" said Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme."" As expected the economy stabilised in the last quarter of 2020. But the latest set of statistics confirm the scale of the hit over the whole of last year. A technical return to recession has been avoided, with the economy returning to growth at the end of last year. But the economy is certainly falling again so far in the first three months of 2021, due to the tough national lockdowns, as well as some impact from increased trade barriers with the European Union. The chancellor and Bank of England will be paying much more attention to what is going on right now. The renewed lockdown has hit growth considerably again, but not as hard as last April. Businesses and households remain in holding pattern ready to unleash pent up growth when the economy is reopened. While the vaccine will eventually unlock that growth, the precise timing is still uncertain, and the government remains under pressure to maintain significant sums in economic support. Last year's contraction is steeper than almost any other big economy, although Spain suffered an 11% decline. Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head of population. Much of the damage to the UK economy is attributed by economists to a high dependence on the service sector, which suffered particularly badly during the year because of lockdown. However, Britain has vaccinated many more people than other European countries so far, raising the prospect of a bounce-back for its economy later this year. That potential fast rebound prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to describe the economy as like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"". Andy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring. Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""There are reasons for cautious optimism, because the vaccine roll-out is going really well. ""The prime minister will set out a roadmap for exiting restrictions in the next few weeks and months. It will be the week of February, 22nd, and it's related that we base our roadmap on the best possible evidence of data."" Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries?

"This video can not be played Bill Michael told consultants to ""stop moaning"" The UK chairman of KPMG has resigned following a row over comments he made at a meeting on Monday. Bill Michael had told consultants to ""stop moaning"" about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on people's lives, and to stop ""playing the victim card"". Announcing his resignation, Mr Michael said his position was ""untenable"". He added that he was ""truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues"". Mr Michael had temporarily stepped aside after KPMG launched an independent investigation into the comments. He said on Friday: ""I love the firm and I am truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues and for the impact the events of this week have had on them. ""In light of that, I regard my position as untenable and so I have decided to leave the firm."" The row blew up this week after Mr Michael made the comments in an online meeting with 500 staff members. Staff had raised concerns over potential pay, pension and bonus cuts. In a video of the meeting widely circulated online, Mr Michael said: ""I have spoken to a lot of partners, and people at all sorts of levels, where it almost feels like this [pandemic] is being done to them. Well, you can't play the role of victim unless you're sick. And I hope you're not sick, and you're not ill, and if you're not, take control of your life, don't sit there and moan about it."" In another part of the video, Mr Michael also questioned whether unconscious bias training, which tries to get people to challenge any stereotypes they hold without realising, was effective. ""There is no such thing as unconscious bias."" he said. ""I don't buy it, because after every single unconscious bias training that's ever been done nothing has ever improved. So unless you care, you actually won't change."" He later apologised for the comments, saying his words did not reflect his beliefs. While at KPMG Mr Michael ""championed the debate about bank culture and standards and the need for change in the industry,""according to a KPMG biography,external. He was also special adviser to the UK's Treasury Select Committee into Banking Standards.

The row blew up this week after Mr Michael made the comments in an online meeting with 500 staff members. Staff had raised concerns over potential pay, pension and bonus cuts. In a video of the meeting widely circulated online, Mr Michael said: ""I have spoken to a lot of partners, and people at all sorts of levels, where it almost feels like this [pandemic] is being done to them. Well, you can't play the role of victim unless you're sick. And I hope you're not sick, and you're not ill, and if you're not, take control of your life, don't sit there and moan about it."" In another part of the video, Mr Michael also questioned whether unconscious bias training, which tries to get people to challenge any stereotypes they hold without realising, was effective. ""There is no such thing as unconscious bias."" he said. ""I don't buy it, because after every single unconscious bias training that's ever been done nothing has ever improved. So unless you care, you actually won't change."" He later apologised for the comments, saying his words did not reflect his beliefs. While at KPMG Mr Michael ""championed the debate about bank culture and standards and the need for change in the industry,""according to a KPMG biography,external. He was also special adviser to the UK's Treasury Select Committee into Banking Standards.

"England's hotel quarantine system could be less stringent than Australia's scheme, a BBC analysis has found. A copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators, ahead of the launch on Monday,showed rules were looser in several key areas. In England, the rules allow guests time outside with security staff, seen in Australia as putting workers at risk. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". Updated guidance for hotels will be released ""imminently"", the Department of Health and Social Care said. Meanwhile, Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said she understood Border Force still had not been given operational guidance on how the hotel quarantine system would work from Monday. When will lockdown rules be reviewed? What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC those arriving from ""red list"" countries - deemed high-risk due to new virus variants - would face strict measures even before they departed for the UK. The requirement to quarantine in a hotelapplies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents,externalarriving in England from such countries, including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, and will cost Â£1,750 for an individual. In Scotland, all those arriving internationally by air will have to isolate in hotels. International travel is currently banned, other than fora small number of permitted reasons,external, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. It comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people to ""persevere"" with England's booking website, where travellers secure rooms and new mandatory tests,after it was hit by technical issues. The site,externalwas taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by 15:00 GMT on Friday following maintenance work. However,the government's advice page on hotel quarantine,externaldid not include a link directing passengers where to book and instead asked people to check back later to make a booking. Ms Cooper said it ""isn't good enough"" that Border Force staff still do not know how the system will work at airports, including whether they will be asked to check for high-risk arrivals and if those passengers will be taken straight to hotels or will have to queue with other travellers. ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be superspreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" the Labour MP said. BBC science editor David Shukman found the rules in England would be looser than Australia's system, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggested: Guests will be allowed access to fresh air outside, escorted by a security guard, whereas in Australia the view is that staff should not be put at risk by escorting people outside There is no guidance on the timing of meal deliveries, potentially leading to cross-infections between guests as room doors are opened at the same time Surgical masks will be required for staff, providing less protection than the masks required in Australia's system The UK government said staff would be able to access regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. In England travellers will only be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. There had been conflicting messages about the policy, with No 10 and the Department of Health forced to issue several clarifications. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Lessons from Australia's hotel quarantine system How a long lockdown crushed Melbourne's second wave Asked about differences between England and Australia's systems, Ms Atkins said standards in England ""are amongst the strongest in the world"". Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said hotels there would ""allow people to behave like human beings"" by going outside for fresh air. But one Australian epidemiologist described allowing travellers quarantining in hotels to leave their rooms for fresh air as ""very risky"". Prof Michael Toole said there was evidence of transmission when guests opened doors, and ""with the positive pressure this kind of fog of virus went out into the corridor, travelled down and infected hotel staff"". Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, said governments had a duty to provide people working in the hotels with ""the highest possible protection from infection"". It comes as the Australian state of Victoriaenters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdownin a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? The UK has secured an initial 4,600 rooms across 16 hotels for its quarantine system. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that, at present, around 1,300 people per week arrive in the UK from red list countries, with this number expected to fall. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources confirmed reports that countries could be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. Rather than previous weekly reviews of travel corridor arrangements, there will now be a ""fast track"" system allowing ministers to quickly curb travel from virus hotspots. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures,external. 39 WAYS TO SAVE THE PLANET:Tom Heap offers up fresh and fascinating ideas to cut carbon ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL?:Learn new things with Greg James and Bella Mackie from Britain's most inspiring teachers Will you be travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" country?

"This video can not be played Camila Batmanghelidjh: ""I am delighted that the justice system paid attention to the facts"" The founder and former trustees of the collapsed charity Kids Company have won a High Court battle against being disqualified from other organisations. The Official Receiver argued they were ""unfit"" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity. But the ruling cleared former chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh and the seven others of personal wrongdoing. The judge added the charity may have survived had it not been for unfounded allegations of criminal activity. A plan to restructure the organisation's finances had been agreed with David Cameron's government. But the charity closed its doors in 2015 after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations, following the broadcast of a BBC Newsnight report. The police investigationconcluded in 2016 after finding no evidence of criminality. In her ruling,,externalMrs Justice Falk said the charity, which worked with hundreds of vulnerable children in London and Bristol, may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed. During the lengthy court battle, the Official Receiver - a body that looks into potential wrongdoing by company directors - had alleged that the charity's former leaders should be disqualified as directors because the organisation had been so badly run. In the run-up to its collapse, the charity was spending around Â£20m a year, up to a quarter of which came from the government. The Official Receiver alleged that Kids Company's business model had become unsustainable from around September 2013 and its failure was inevitable. It also alleged that the defendants knew or ought to have known that and should have planned to avoid financial collapse. The charity's chairman at the time of its collapse, who was also cleared by the ruling, was the former BBC executive Alan Yentob. Mrs Justice Falk said the case was not proven. ""There was no allegation of dishonesty, bad faith or personal gain,"" said the judge. ""There was no allegation of inappropriate expenditure in relation to any of the children assisted by Kids Company. ""The allegation is not made out against any of the directors and they are not unfit. The case against them fails. ""While aspects of the charity's work were high-risk, the business model was not unsustainable."" Mrs Justice Falk said the charity had grown rapidly from its south London base as demand for its specialist support services for vulnerable children grew. Despite having a substantial and stable government grant, it also needed to raise additional funds from private donors - and by 2015 it was in talks with Whitehall over how to do that amid concerns about its cash flow and staff costs. ""That restructuring plan was agreed and a further government grant was awarded,"" said the judge. ""However the charity was forced to close after sexual assault allegations [the same week]. The charity was exonerated following a police investigation - but by that time it was too late. ""Had it not been for those unfounded allegations, it is more likely than not that the restructuring would have succeeded and the charity would have survived."" The judge described the people running the charity as a ""group of highly impressive and dedicated individuals who selflessly gave enormous amounts of their time to what was clearly a highly challenging trusteeship"". In a statement after the ruling, Ms Batmanghelidjh, who founded Kids Company in 1996, said: ""I hope this judgement will be the first step in refuting the many lies that have been told and banishing the false myths. ""My regret is that many thousands of children whom we supported were left unassisted and vulnerable once our service was withdrawn and that there were many others who never got a chance to receive help."" Speaking on the BBC News Channel, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the ruling was ""justice"" for the ""thousands of staff, volunteers and donors who created Kids Company over nearly 20 years"". But she said Kids Company would not have had to ""carry that burden of child protection if the child protection system in this country was fit for purpose"". A statement issued on behalf of former trustees said: ""Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible. ""We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law.""

"A documentary that examined the singer's conservatorship was released last week A judge has denied a request by Britney Spears' father to exert greater control over her finances. Jamie Spears has controlled his daughter's financial affairs since 2008, but the singer has recently indicated she wants him removed. On Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer. The judge rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments. The ruling means Mr Spears and the private trust company, Bessemer Trust, will now have equal power to manage her finances. As a result, he is now expected to work with the company to create a budget and investment proposal for the singer's estate. The conservatorship is a legal arrangement that was put in place because of concerns about her mental health. Los Angeles Judge Brenda Penny appointed Bessemer Trust as co-conservators in November, but rejected the star's effort to remove her father entirely. Fans from the Free Britney campaign gathered outside the court on Thursday Jamie Spears had objected to Bessemer's involvement, arguing that it reduced the power he has held for years. Judge Perry threw out his objection on Thursday. Another hearing is scheduled for 17 March. Britney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III has previously said the singer is ""afraid"" of her father and does not want him to control her finances and career. On Thursday, Mr Ingham reiterated the pop star's wish, adding that it was ""no secret"" she didn't want her father to be a co-conservator, but acknowledged that removing him altogether would be a ""separate issue"". Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Why a court battle is fuelling #FreeBritney calls Interest in the case has been renewed after the recent release of a documentary that focuses on the conflict over the singer's guardianship. Framing Britney Spears, which was produced by The New York Times, examined the conservatorship in depth, as well as how the singer has been treated by the media throughout her career. It also explored the #FreeBritney movement, a campaign by some of the star's fans who believe her life and career are being controlled against her will. Campaigners from the group were outside the hearing on Thursday. Jamie Spears and Britney, pictured in 2006 Babs Gray, host of the BritneyGram podcast, told the BBC outside the court: ""It hasn't changed anything much today... I don't think a lot of forward movement will happen until Britney's lawyer actually files to get her out of the conservatorship."" She said interest in the #FreeBritney issue had ""exploded"" in the past week as a result of the documentary. ""It's been really encouraging to see how supportive everyone is about the movement, how they are reckoning with how Britney was treated in the past,"" she said. ""I hope its not just a flash in the pan. I hope people keep paying attention and keep putting the pressure on."" Britney Spears hasn't performed live for more than two years, and insists she has no intention of doing so again until her father is forced to relinquish control over her career.

"Donald Trump's lawyers have finished making their case for his innocence He is accused of causing, over many months and then on 6 January, a deadly insurrection at Congress The riot was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified ""You can't incite what was already going to happen"" said his lawyer who said the attack was pre-planned Trump was exercising freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent, his legal team said And they accused Democrats of hypocrisy, playing an 11-minute video of them using the word ""fight"" On Thursday Democrats said Trump had shown no remorse and could do the same again They had earlier presented previously unseen footage of the rioters inside the Capitol building Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Jessica Murphy Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of day four of the impeachment trial. What could be the final day of proceedings begins tomorrow at10:00 EST/15:00 GMT- and we'll be back here for it. You can catch up on the latest here. Some of the key moments from today:  Today's editors and writers were Tom Spender, Jessica Murphy, Tom Geoghegan, Ashitha Nagesh, Sam Cabral, and Ritu Prasad. The trial has ended for today and it went rather speedily. Over the course of the day, we saw the Trump legal team present its case and both sides undergo a question-and-answer session with their jurors in the Senate. Barring a request for more witnesses, the only thing left in the trial is the closing arguments. Tomorrow - likely the trial's final day - resumes at10:00 EST (15:00 GMT). The question and answer session has just wrapped. Another order of business is now presented by leader Chuck Schumer: awarding a congressional gold medal to Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer lauded as a hero. This is met with loud applause from the chamber. Schumer says it's not just Goodman, but all of the law enforcement officials who worked to protect lawmakers. ""Let us give them all the honour and recognition they so justly deserve."" More applause follows. Before they vote on awarding that medal, Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell also gives a short speech thanking officer Goodman in particular, and others. If not for him, McConnell says, ""people in this chamber may not have escaped unharmed. Officer Goodman's actions reflect a deep personal commitment to duty"".

Hosted by our correspondents Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis, the latest episode dives into the central question of this week's impeachment trial: did Trump's language incite the riots at the Capitol? To do that, they spoke to Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who publicly warned people could end up dead because of Trump's false election claims. You can listen and subscribe to Americast on the free BBC Sounds app, which is available worldwide. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Most people enjoy a Friday night beverage of wine or beer, but here on the Senate Floor, Senator Romney is ringing in the weekend with a cold glass of chocolate milk. And it was quite a thirst quencher for him as he chugged it. Quickly! Milk and water are actually the only two drinks allowed on the Senate floor. Since senators spend so much time talking, they are more prone to a dry mouth, which is why water is allowed. In a filibuster though, where Senators can talk for hours at a time as a stalling tactic, they need more than water to get through. So, there is an exception in ""Riddick's Senate Procedure,"" a compendium of guidelines written by a former Senate parliamentarian that allow milk on the Senate floor. A question from Louisiana Republican Senator Cassidy notes that by 14:15 on 6 January, Trump should have been aware of the riot. But he then tweeted that Pence ""lacked courage"" and did not call for law enforcement. So did Trump not care that Pence was in danger, Cassidy asks? Trump's lawyer Van der Veen responds first. He says he disputes the ""premise of the facts laid out in that question"" ""Unfortunately, we're not going to know the answer to the facts in this proceeding because the House did nothing to investigate what was going on."" Van der Veen adds: ""I have no idea and nobody from the House has given us any opportunity to have any idea but Mr Trump and Mr Pence have had a very good relationship for a long time."" He's sure, therefore, that Trump was concerned for Pence and everyone else in the Capitol. Lead manager Raskin takes the question for the prosecution. ""[Trump's] counsel keep blaming the House for not having the evidence that's within the sole possession of their client, who we invited to testify last week,"" Raskin argues. He says the former president was invited to explain what happened, but House managers received a ""contemptuous response"". ""Rather than yelling at us,"" Raskin concludes, ""bring your client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending out tweets denouncing the vice-president while the vice-president was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him."" This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world Senators have four hours to ask questions of the two sides in this trial. And we are now into the second hour. So far, most Democratic Senators have asked questions of the House impeachment managers - from their party - and most Republican Senators have asked questions of the Trump defence team - representing the former leader of their party. A few questions - particularly the ones posed to both sides - have seen fiery exchanges between the two legal teams. But the Q&A portion looks unlikely to change many minds and the trial is quickly heading toward a conclusion. Once this session ends, the two sides will make their closing arguments and then vote on whether Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection or not. Senators Ted Cruz, left, and Lindsey Graham, right Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee paid a visit to the Trump defence team yesterday and today, US media report. The meetings have drawn some criticism from across the aisle as senators are meant to be impartial jurors in an impeachment trial.  Allow Twitter content?

Sources told CNN and the Washington Post they have been advising them on their legal approach. According to the Post,external, David Schoen - one of the attorneys - said they spoke about ""how this format goes, you know, the question-and-answer period, all that... and then just talking about where theyâre from and all that"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A question about whether Trump actually won the election gives House impeachment manager Barbara Plaskett a chance to talk about how politicians of all stripes have to learn how to lose elections - and most do so gracefully. ""I lost my first election. I stayed in bed for three days,"" she said. ""We do what we need to do and we move on."" The question gave Trump attorney Bruce Castor a chance to attack the questioner, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""Who asked that question?"" asked the lawyer, to groans from Senate Democrats. His own opinion, said Castor, was irrelevant. The issue before the Senate was whether Trump incited an insurrection. And the Trump team's answer was he didnât. It looks like the final vote to convict or acquit could come on Saturday. The Democrats have an uphill battle persuading 17 Republicans to join them in exercising the ultimate sanction on a (former) president. Here are some of the senators to watch. Why Mitt Romney? Because he is a Trump critic and expected to convict Why Mitch McConnell? Because he knows the mood of his party better than anyone Why Bill Cassidy? Because he backed Democrats in advancing the case to trial Why Lisa Murkowski? Because the Alaska senator could also vote against Trump Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins just posed one of the more interesting queries â to both sides â so far during the trialâs four-hour question time. When Donald Trump sent a disparaging tweet about Mike Pence, they asked, did he know that the vice-president had been removed from the Senate chamber by Secret Service for his safety? Answering for the impeachment managers, Congressman Joaquin Castro said that the president must have known that Pence was being threatened by the mob. The violence was being broadcast on national television, the White House has the extensive communications facilities and the president himself had just been informed by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville that Pence had been evacuated during a phone conversation the two had at roughly the same time. Responding for Trumpâs defence, lawyer Michael van der Bleen said Trump did not know. He added that the House Democrats had done no investigation into the matter during their ârushedâ impeachment proceedings and, besides, Trumpâs actions during the Capitol riot were not included in the impeachment article, which dealt with inciting an insurrection. The question - from two Republicans who are likely to vote to convict - gets to the heart of the case against the former president. Did Trumpâs actions during the riot - including his condemnation of Pence - indicate that he knew that violence was likely and that he welcomed and encouraged them? The House impeachment managers insist the answer is yes. On Tuesday, Lousiana Senator Bill Cassidy was one of only six Republicans who voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial. He explained to reporters that House impeachment managers had made a persuasive case on Tuesday - day one of the trial - and he wanted to hear them out. But, as our correspondent Jon Sopel notes, it looks like Cassidy has since made up his mind that Donald Trump should be acquitted in this trial. Or has he? His office told CNN that Cassidy remains undecided âand is reviewing memos from both points of view as part of his thought process before coming to a conclusionâ. Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Paige Harding, a Republican supporting college student in Lawrence, Kansas, sees both trials - the impeachment of Trump from a year ago and the one today - as a waste of time. Still, her view of impeachment has changed, in one sense. She does not believe Trump will run for office again, and so he is no longer an issue. As a University of Kansas senior, she thinks members of Congress should instead focus on the economy. âIâd rather have them spend their time helping to make sure I can get a job when I graduate,â she told me. Other Midwesterners share her views, saying both impeachments were unnecessary. âNo new facts have emerged,â says David Kensinger, a political operative in Topeka, Kansas, describing the current proceedings. âSeems like largely a non-event.â For Harvey Joe Sanner, a farmer in Arkansas, though, the most frustrating thing about the two impeachments has been the following: the Senators do not have enough votes to convict. âTrump is guilty as hell,â Sanner says. Yet the impeachments have failed. âItâs just a matter of politics,â he says. âAnd thatâs very unfortunate.â And so it begins. Answers are limited to five minutes each (if the question is directed to both counsel and House prosecutors, the time will be split). Democratic leader Senator Chuck Schumer is first to submit a question on behalf of himself and Senator Feinstein. He asks the impeachment managers: ""Isn't it the case that the violent attack and seige on the Capitol on January 6th would not have happened if not for the conduct of President Trump?"" ""To answer your question very directly, Donald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled the mob and he lit the flame,"" answers Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro. ""Everything that followed was because of his doing. And though he could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, he never did."" The senators are back. Now comes the period of questioning. Senators aren't allowed to ask their own questions aloud - instead, they submit them in writing to Senator Leahy, who is presiding over the session, and then he has his clerk read them out. Our reporter Samantha Granville, who is in the Senate chamber today, says sources do not believe the full four hours will be used. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Bill Cassidy was seen taking notes Republican senators have been criticised this week for not paying full
attention during the impeachment managers' presentations, and coming and
going as they pleased throughout the last two days. At one point yesterday
there were 15 empty Republican seats. Today though, only three Republican seats were empty and the members of the party
seemed much more attentive. Senator Cassidy was taking good notes, and Senator Rand Paul chuckled when
the video of Maxine Waters challenging Electoral College results played. Meanwhile, Democrats on the other side of the chamber were mostly silent
during the video - aside from a few whispers here and there. Senator Elizabeth
Warren, who made many cameos in it, seemed to just stare ahead, grasping her pen tightly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

These will be answered on the Senate floor over the coming four hours. There will then be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Assuming there are no witnesses, as both Republicans and Democrats are said to favour a speedy trial, we could see a vote on conviction as early as tomorrow - a month to the day Trump after was impeached by the House.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At times, Trumpâs defence presentation felt like it was drawn from the conservative media ecosystem that fueled the former presidentâs political rise. The video montages â frequently featuring the same handful of clips packaged in different ways, accompanied by foreboding music and rapidly edited scenes of fire and violence â would seem familiar to regular viewers of evening opinion programmes on Fox News. The clips featured many of the Democratic politicians who have become villains for the right â Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Ayanna Pressley â as well as media figures like CNNâs Chris Cuomo and Hollywood stars such as Madonna and Johnny Depp. Trumpâs defence also used lengthy excerpts of Trump speeches, some of which included attacks on Republicans as well as Democrats to cheering crowds, as if to remind the Republican senators sitting in judgement of the support Trump still enjoys within the Republican Party. It could also be an attempt to shore up that Trump base after two days of attacks from the Democrats. This case isnât just about the law, after all. Itâs about politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended to the end of May. Covid-related delays meant more than 16,000 sales were at risk, with buyers facing large bills were purchases to fall through at the last minute. Construction of newly-built homes, which qualify for the scheme, have been put back by as much as eight months. Some buyers are worried that the new, two-month extended deadline will still come too soon. In seven years, the Help to Buy equity loan scheme has allowed 278,000 households to receive an advance from the government to help pay the deposit to buy a newly-built home. The scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England. However, data from Homes England obtained through a BBC Freedom of Information request showed that, as of the end of January, there were 16,691 sales still to be completed under the current scheme. In many cases, construction workers have needed to self-isolate, supply lines have slowed, overseas labour may have needed to quarantine, and some traders have been furloughed. Most buyers 'did not need' Help to Buy Buyers face losing thousands of pounds if their properties are not built in time. The government's extension to the deadline - the latest of three - gives homebuilders an extra two months to complete developments. It means that purchases can be completed by the end of May. ""This measure provides certainty to developers to build out homes delayed and further protects customers whose purchases have been delayed by Covid-19,"" a spokesman for Homes England said. He added the move was aimed to ensure ""those buying a home through the scheme are not disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control"". Greg Saunders said the new deadline was a relief Greg Saunders, 31, who is buying with his boyfriend David Leith, 36,told the BBC in Januarythat their purchase was in doubt owing to the delays. Mr Saunders said no blame was attached to the builders who had done their best in the circumstances caused by the pandemic - but missing the deadline would have ruined their hopes of a new dream home and cost them about Â£2,000 in solicitor fees. Now, following the government's latest announcement, he said: ""It's a huge relief. It has helped me and my partner and so many other people. ""This is great news and it is good that the government is listening but this still won't help everyone. I don't think the extension until the end of May quite reflects the true scale of the delays facing developers at the moment."" Andrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco mortgage brokers, said: ""While Homes England have told developers there will be no more extensions, this should give builders some much needed breathing space to fully complete the property and ensure that their buyers do not miss out. ""It will be interesting to see whether or not this extension sets the scene for something similar to happen withthe stamp duty holiday."" The Help to Buy scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England and is being replaced by a less generous version restricted to first-time buyers which starts for new applicants at the beginning in April. Stefanie Weingarth and Carl Young still have concerns Stefanie Weingarth, 29, and Carl Young, 32, had agreed in October to buy a house near Didcot in Oxfordshire, with the help of a Â£112,000 Help to Buy loan. The house was supposed to be completed in late February - but Covid-related delays mean the build is at least six to eight weeks behind. Ms Weingarth said: ""It's great news that the government have extended the deadline. Our developers are pretty certain they'll have our home ready in time now. We're hoping to move in mid April. It's our first family home and we wouldn't be able to afford it without the current Help to Buy scheme."" She already owns a property, so the couple would be ineligible for the new scheme which is restricted to first-time buyers. The only sticking point now is that the couple will not be able to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, one of the reasons they decided to buy together in the first place. The tax break deadline is the end of March. As their property will not be ready until April, they now face the prospect of trying to find an extra Â£15,000 for stamp duty. ""It seems unfair for the government to acknowledge that there are construction days, so extend Help to Buy, but not extend stamp duty for us,"" said Ms Weingarth.

"England's hotel quarantine system could be less stringent than Australia's scheme, a BBC analysis has found. A copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators, ahead of the launch on Monday,showed rules were looser in several key areas. In England, the rules allow guests time outside with security staff, seen in Australia as putting workers at risk. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". Updated guidance for hotels will be released ""imminently"", the Department of Health and Social Care said. Meanwhile, Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said she understood Border Force still had not been given operational guidance on how the hotel quarantine system would work from Monday. When will lockdown rules be reviewed? What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC those arriving from ""red list"" countries - deemed high-risk due to new virus variants - would face strict measures even before they departed for the UK. The requirement to quarantine in a hotelapplies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents,externalarriving in England from such countries, including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, and will cost Â£1,750 for an individual. In Scotland, all those arriving internationally by air will have to isolate in hotels. International travel is currently banned, other than fora small number of permitted reasons,external, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. It comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people to ""persevere"" with England's booking website, where travellers secure rooms and new mandatory tests,after it was hit by technical issues. The site,externalwas taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by 15:00 GMT on Friday following maintenance work. However,the government's advice page on hotel quarantine,externaldid not include a link directing passengers where to book and instead asked people to check back later to make a booking. Ms Cooper said it ""isn't good enough"" that Border Force staff still do not know how the system will work at airports, including whether they will be asked to check for high-risk arrivals and if those passengers will be taken straight to hotels or will have to queue with other travellers. ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be superspreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" the Labour MP said. BBC science editor David Shukman found the rules in England would be looser than Australia's system, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggested: Guests will be allowed access to fresh air outside, escorted by a security guard, whereas in Australia the view is that staff should not be put at risk by escorting people outside There is no guidance on the timing of meal deliveries, potentially leading to cross-infections between guests as room doors are opened at the same time Surgical masks will be required for staff, providing less protection than the masks required in Australia's system The UK government said staff would be able to access regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. In England travellers will only be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. There had been conflicting messages about the policy, with No 10 and the Department of Health forced to issue several clarifications. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' Lessons from Australia's hotel quarantine system How a long lockdown crushed Melbourne's second wave Asked about differences between England and Australia's systems, Ms Atkins said standards in England ""are amongst the strongest in the world"". Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said hotels there would ""allow people to behave like human beings"" by going outside for fresh air. But one Australian epidemiologist described allowing travellers quarantining in hotels to leave their rooms for fresh air as ""very risky"". Prof Michael Toole said there was evidence of transmission when guests opened doors, and ""with the positive pressure this kind of fog of virus went out into the corridor, travelled down and infected hotel staff"". Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, said governments had a duty to provide people working in the hotels with ""the highest possible protection from infection"". It comes as the Australian state of Victoriaenters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdownin a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? The UK has secured an initial 4,600 rooms across 16 hotels for its quarantine system. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that, at present, around 1,300 people per week arrive in the UK from red list countries, with this number expected to fall. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources confirmed reports that countries could be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. Rather than previous weekly reviews of travel corridor arrangements, there will now be a ""fast track"" system allowing ministers to quickly curb travel from virus hotspots. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures,external. 39 WAYS TO SAVE THE PLANET:Tom Heap offers up fresh and fascinating ideas to cut carbon ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL?:Learn new things with Greg James and Bella Mackie from Britain's most inspiring teachers Will you be travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" country?

"This video can not be played Bill Michael told consultants to ""stop moaning"" The UK chairman of KPMG has resigned following a row over comments he made at a meeting on Monday. Bill Michael had told consultants to ""stop moaning"" about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on people's lives, and to stop ""playing the victim card"". Announcing his resignation, Mr Michael said his position was ""untenable"". He added that he was ""truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues"". Mr Michael had temporarily stepped aside after KPMG launched an independent investigation into the comments. He said on Friday: ""I love the firm and I am truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues and for the impact the events of this week have had on them. ""In light of that, I regard my position as untenable and so I have decided to leave the firm."" The row blew up this week after Mr Michael made the comments in an online meeting with 500 staff members. Staff had raised concerns over potential pay, pension and bonus cuts. In a video of the meeting widely circulated online, Mr Michael said: ""I have spoken to a lot of partners, and people at all sorts of levels, where it almost feels like this [pandemic] is being done to them. Well, you can't play the role of victim unless you're sick. And I hope you're not sick, and you're not ill, and if you're not, take control of your life, don't sit there and moan about it."" In another part of the video, Mr Michael also questioned whether unconscious bias training, which tries to get people to challenge any stereotypes they hold without realising, was effective. ""There is no such thing as unconscious bias."" he said. ""I don't buy it, because after every single unconscious bias training that's ever been done nothing has ever improved. So unless you care, you actually won't change."" He later apologised for the comments, saying his words did not reflect his beliefs. While at KPMG Mr Michael ""championed the debate about bank culture and standards and the need for change in the industry,""according to a KPMG biography,external. He was also special adviser to the UK's Treasury Select Committee into Banking Standards. When Mr Michael stepped aside pending the investigation into his commentsKPMG appointed its first female leaders in 150 years. Bina Mehta stepped in as acting chairman and Mary O'Connor took over Mr Michael's day-to-day executive responsibilities as acting senior partner. Ms Mehta said on Friday: ""Bill has made a huge contribution to our firm over the last 30 years, especially over the last three years as chairman, and we wish him all the best for the future.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford and Dr Sally Lewis, clinical operational lead for Covid vaccination in Wales, have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Mr Drakeford says ""cautious"" talks have begun about the tourism sector being able to reopen in time for Easter Another 25 people have died with Covid in Wales, while more than 700,000 people have now been vaccinated, Public Health Wales says Wales is the first UK nation to have given or offered everyone in the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government says However, the NHS in Wales is checking its lists to make sure no-one has been missed, the first minister said James McCarthy and Andy Roberts That is it from Fridayâs coronavirus live page - thank you for joining us. Here are today's headlines:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. Stay safe, and have a good weekend. BBC Radio Wales When Wales was locked down to try to stop the spread of coronavirus,comedian Lorna Prichardthought it would put a halt to her planned return to the world of dating. But the film fan from Cardiff went online, found her hero and fell in love. Hear the story of how she found her happy ending inWhen Lorna Met Leo: Love in the Time of Covidfrom BBC Radio Wales. Front-line police officers and staff should be on a daily reserve list for spare vaccines that would otherwise go to waste, the Police Federationâs Welsh lead has said. Mark Bleasdale reiterated calls for police to be prioritised in the roll-out programme for Covid jabs. âThe frustration level among front-line officers is high,"" he said. ""This is because they are not being given any priority in the first phase of the roll-out of the jabs. ""But this has now been compounded by the fact that we are hearing of a wastage rate of âonly 1%â which, based on 600,000 first dose vaccinations being administered, is still 6,000 doses."" Mr Bleasdale said he believed 5,000 doses would be enough for all front-line officers and staff in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he thinks ""we're going to see a bit more fluidity"" between the next five priority groups for Covid vaccination in the second stage of the programme in Wales, compared to the first phase. ""We won't be going just 'five, six, seven' down the line - people will be called in for vaccination across the five groups,"" he said. ""That's because we have so many hundreds of thousands of people to vaccinate that the system will need a bit of flexibility to make sure that every single appointment can be kept and every single dose of vaccine can be used."" But Dr Sally Lewis, who is leading Wales' vaccination programme, added: ""Of course, we want to immunise the most vulnerable first. ""For example, those who may be severely immunosuppressed, we would want to try and reach those people first,"" she said. This video can not be played Covid: Who are the scientists hunting variants down in Wales? Meet Jess Hey, a Public Health Wales scientist who is working on hunting down new variants of Covid-19. She is part ofa team of 16, based in Cardiff, that has been able to sequence between 15 and 20% of all positive cases in Wales since Covid arrived, one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. Ms Hey, who only started three months ago, prepares samples selected at random from positive Covid tests across and helps to look for tiny differences between the samples in the virus's genetic code. She said her work is ""very different"" from when she was a zoology student but ""exciting"". Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have welcomed the Welsh Governmentâs announcement that it has met its first vaccination âmilestoneâ. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales wasthe first UK nation to meet the target of giving or offering a Covid vaccine to everyone in the four top priority groups. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was âfantastic news and  a cause for celebrationâ. He added: âWeâre motoring now so letâs keep up this pace â itâs Wales at its best with everyone on the ground working together."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: âItâs a great news story after a bleak winter and we thank everyone involved."" He added: âThereâs still 80% of the population to be vaccinated and thereâs still a long way to go.â Wales isthe first UK nation to meet the target of offering a Covid vaccine to the four top priority groups, First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed today. But he stressed there was no âcompetitionâ with other countries, which are expected to hit the same milestone in the next few days. All four UK nations are aiming to offer a vaccine to the over-70s, health care workers, care home staff and care home residents by mid-February. Mr Drakeford said: âWeâre the first UK nation to reach this milestone, others will follow in a couple of days. âWeâre not in competition with each other.  Every part of the UK is working as hard as it can to get to this milestone.â Wales' first minister has said if current progress against coronavirus continues to be maintained, the authorities could ""slowly and cautiously"" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter ""in all aspects of our lives"". Mark Drakeford said this included tourism, but depended on Wales continuing to see reductions in infection levels, as well as ""the impact on our health service being drained away"" and ""our vaccination programme delivering what we hope it will do in terms of the protection it will offer to people"". He said: ""If that is the path we are on, then the pattern in Wales, as we move towards the spring and Easter, will be one in which we will be able to slowly and cautiously lift the restrictions that are currently in place in all aspects of our lives. ""That will include the tourism industry and it'll include those aspects of family life which are denied to us all at the moment, but that is a path that depends upon continuing success. ""And we've learned so often, haven't we, over the last 12 months coronavirus continues to have very unpleasant surprises up its sleeve."" A target date for giving all people aged over 50 in Wales their first Covid-19 vaccine will be announced in the next few days, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. With all those over 70 due to have been given a vaccine or appointment by Sunday, attention is turning to the next priority groups. The current stated aim is to offer a vaccine to those over 50, and younger people who have serious health conditions, by spring. But Mr Drakeford said a more detailed target would be set. âWe will say something more specific than we have said so far,â he said. âOnce we have got through this next couple of weeks, and weâre completely certain that the first four groups are behind us, then we will say something a little more definite about when we expect the next five groups to be completed.â Mr Drakeford said there was no indication of any further slowdown in supply of the vaccine after the next fortnight, when there will be a reduction.

Supplies would then accelerate in March, he said. Wales' first minister says although more than one in five people in Wales has had the first vaccine dose, ânow the hard work really begins as we move on to the next priority groups"". Mark Drakeford said: âOver the next few weeks, we will see a slight reduction in the amount of vaccine we receive, especially compared to levels we have had over the last few weeks. âThis is a planned, UK-wide issue. âWe have factored this into our vaccination plans, and it wonât affect peopleâs appointments, and it wonât delay when people are due to get their second dose."" The first minister said that over the next few months, the vaccine would be offered to everyone in groups five to nine. He confirmed this would include ""everyone aged 50 to 69, everyone over 16 who has an underlying health condition, which puts them at increased risk, and a great many unpaid carers who provide care for someone who is vulnerable to the virusâ. Dr Sally Lewis, the clinical operational lead for Wales' Covid vaccination programme, said the first milestone had been reached due to a âmassive collaborative effortâ. She said this approach would continue for the next six months. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said all people in the top four priority groups in Wales have now had a jab or been offered one, with the focus now turning to the next five groups. Dr Lewis said more work needed to be carried out into encouraging people with concerns about vaccines to come forward for vaccination. âWe need to increase confidence where there is vaccine hesitancyâ, she said. First Minister Mark Drakeford is urging anyone from the first four priority groups in Wales who hasnât been contacted about getting a vaccination to get in touch with their local health board. Mr Drakeford said take-up of the vaccine had been incredibly high with the latest figures showing more than 715,000 people had had the first dose of the vaccine. âWe want to make sure that no one from these first four groups is left behind,"" he said. âIf youâve changed your mind about having the vaccine or missed your appointment because of illness, you havenât missed out on your chance of having the vaccine. âThe NHS is checking and rechecking its lists to make sure it hasnât missed anyone and will be continuing to invite people to come forward through the weekend. âEvery health board has dedicated phone lines and email addresses for people in these first four groups to get in touch to arrange an appointment. âWeâve put these on our website too,â he added. First Minister Mark Drakeford says the first milestone in the Welsh Governmentâs vaccination strategy has been met withvaccines offered to all people in the first four priority groups. Speaking at today's coronavirus briefing, he said: âAt the beginning of December, Wales became one of the first countries in the world to start vaccinating people against coronavirus. âToday, just 66 days later, I am incredibly proud to say we have achieved the first milestone in our vaccination strategy. âThis means we have offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups. âThatâs everyone over 70, all front-line health and social care workers, everyone living and working in older peopleâs care homes and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable."" Reality Check There have been growing concerns about the uptake of Covid vaccines among black, Asian and other ethnic minority communities in the UK. Some fear vaccine ""hesitancy"" could be increased by false and misleading information shared online. The BBC has beeninvestigating some examples. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. For the first time, he'll be joined by Dr Sally Lewis, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales.

The number of people to have received their first vaccine jab in Wales has passed 700,000. Another 31,847 people received their first Covid dose yesterday, taking the total to 715,944. Second Covid doses have been given to 4,010 people. A further 25 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales (PHW). It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths in Wales to 5,084. There have been a further 608 cases reported, taking the total to 198,362 since the start of the pandemic. Wales' overall seven-day case rate is now 102 cases for every 100,000 people.

John Sneddon said it meant ""the absolute world"" to be back with his wife of 23 years, Barbara, and they now have lunch together each day. The couple had been admitted to hospital separately because of health problems, before they both tested positive for coronavirus. They finally laid eyes on each other after Mrs Sneddon was transferred to County Hospital in Griffithstown, near Pontypool, where John was already receiving treatment. Mrs Sneddon said she had been forced to have ""Christmas dinner alone, for the first time in my life"", before having to go into hospital herself. Wales will be thefirst UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government has said. Within hours, officials say, all over-70s including care home residents will have been offered a first dose. Wales and the other UK nations have aimed to hit the target by mid-February. First Minister Mark Drakeford thanked ""everyone who had been working around the clock to reach this point"". It follows a warning that vaccine supplieswill fall in the coming weeks. The UK Government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales' milestone was ""fantastic news"" and testament to the continued effort made by NHS and military staff. A greater proportion of people in Wales have received a jab than other UK nations ""Cautious"" talks about the tourism sector being able to reopen in time for Easter have begun, Wales' first minister has said.

"The UK economy is like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"", the Bank of England's chief economist has said. Andy Haldane said consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring. He is the latest economist to forecast a sharp rebound in growth after an expected easing of restrictions. The economy is currently set to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Mr Haldane said: ""With 13 million of the most vulnerable people already vaccinated, the risk of death or hospitalisation in the UK has already probably halved. ""By the end of March, based on the current pace of vaccine rollout and government data on vulnerable groups, this risk may have been reduced by as much as three-quarters and by the end of the second quarter it will be even smaller."" UK economy 'to rebound strongly thanks to vaccine' Home working cuts creativity, says Bank economist As a result, he said health concerns would fall and restrictions lift, allowing people to return to spending and socialising. The turn in sentiment was likely to be rapid, he added - ""a light-switch being flicked rather than a dimmer-switch being turned"". ""Having been bottled in for a year, most people are desperate to get their lives, including their social lives, back. ""When given the opportunity to do so safely, they will seize it,"" he said. He said shared social experiences - from pubs to sports to cinema - would benefit, as glimpsed last summer during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. And unlike past recessions, he added, many UK households had strengthened their finances during lockdown and would have more money to spend. ""That might mean two pub, cinema or restaurant visits a week rather than one,"" he said. ""It might mean a higher-spec TV or car or house."" On top of this he said a significant number of companies had amassed cash during the crisis, which would likely be invested as restrictions started to ease. ""That would be good news for jobs, helping to recover some of the million lost so far in this crisis,"" Mr Haldane wrote. ""And it would be good news for business investment too, helping companies boost their performance and productivity - and, ultimately, the pay of their workers."" With continued government support added to the mix, he said a strong bounce-back was assured. ""The economy is poised like a coiled spring. As its energies are released, the recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget.""

"This video can not be played 'It feels like we're part of history' Up to 80,000 NI people who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 can now book a vaccination appointment. Appointments can be made online,externalfor vaccinations at seven centres. Online appointments are available for this weekend, with telephone booking available from next week. The news comes as the Department of Health reported another nine coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, bringing its death total to 1,975. There were 407 new cases recorded. There are 488 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland. It comes as the number of Covid-19-related deaths registered fell for a second week, according to Northern Ireland's statistics agency. The virus was listed on the death certificates of 126 people in the week to 5 February. Health Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination appointment announcement would be ""very welcome to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and have been looking forward to getting vaccinated"". ""A start has already been made on the CEV category and offering booked appointments will help to accelerate this,"" he added. ""I would again appeal to everyone to be patient - whether that's waiting on the line to book your vaccination appointment by telephone or waiting your turn in the vaccination programme."" The system will be open to all those who received a shielding letter. Vaccine row 'political penalty kick for unionists' EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI They will have to bring that letter with them to the vaccination centre to prove their eligibility and will receive the Pfizer vaccine. Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, said people should not panic if they cannot find their shielding letter. ""This is going to be open for a while, there's plenty of appointments. ""For some individuals, they will be called by their GPs, so they may in fact find that their GP is calling them forward - but we're going to issue further advice on this next week."" Earlier, referring to vaccinations, NI's chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show he was ""confident that we will have completed over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable through February and perhaps into early March"". About 401,966 vaccines have been administered to date, with 373,414 of them being first doses and the remaining 28,552 being second doses, according to the Department of Health. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) has recorded a fall of 11 Covid-19-related deaths on the previous week's toll of 137. It is also the second time the number has fallensince the record high of 182 reported on 22 January. It brings the agency's total of coronavirus-related registered deaths to 2,574. The Department of Health's total for the same date, based on a positive test result being recorded, was 1,923. Nisra's figures are higher than that recorded by the department because it records all mentions of the virus on death certificates, even though it may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test. On the agency's measure, there have been 1,676 Covid-19-related deaths in hospital, including the deaths of 224 care home residents. Are NI's Covid trends turning in right direction? Is Northern Ireland exiting the Covid-19 peak? Taking that figure, and the 737 who died in care homes, it means care home residents now account for fewer than two-fifths (36.8%) of all virus-related deaths. Virus-related deaths were also recorded in hospices (0.5%) and other residential locations (7.2%). Deaths in care homes and hospitals involved 174 separate establishments. People aged 75 and over account for more than three-quarters of all Covid-19-related registered deaths (77.2%) between 19 March 2020 and 5 February 2021. The Antrim and Newtownabbey (9.9%), and Mid-Ulster (7.7%) local government districts have now recorded higher proportions of all coronavirus-related deaths, compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (8.3% and 6.4% respectively). The provisional number of deaths from all causes for the week ending 5 February was 462. That is 25 more than the previous week, and 125 more than the five-year average for the time of year, which is 337. On Friday, the Republic of Ireland recorded a further 21 deaths linked to Covid-19, bringing its total to 3,865. There have been 207,720 cases of the virus after the Irish department of health was notified of an additional 921 cases. There are 959 Covid-19 inpatients in the Republic, with 173 in intensive care.

"Online travel agent Lastminute.com will be taken to court unless it pays more than Â£1m of outstanding refunds, the competition regulator has said. Lastminute.com had promised to refund people for package holidays cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But it missed a repayment deadline at the end of January. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said,externalthe company needed to pay people back within seven days to avoid court action. ""It is wholly unacceptable that thousands of Lastminute.com customers are still waiting for full refunds for package holidays despite the commitments the company signed with us,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. ""We take breaches of commitments extremely seriously. If Lastminute.com does not comply with the law and pay people their outstanding refunds quickly, we will take the company to court."" Lastminute.com has been approached for comment. Last week, the online travel agent said the refund process had been ""very complex and difficult"". In December,Lastminute.com made a commitment to the watchdog to pay out more Â£7mto more than 9,000 customers when their holidays were cancelled due to the pandemic. People were supposed to get their money back by 31 January, but Lastminute.com still owes more than Â£1m to 2,600 customers, the CMA said. The travel agent also told some of those package holiday customers to go directly to their airline to get the cost of their flight back, which the regulator said it was not supposed to do. Consumer group Which? said Lastminute.com had been ""one of the worst culprits when it comes to failing to refund customers for coronavirus cancellations"". Which? had called on the CMA to uncover how many people had not been refunded in time. Rory Boland, editor of Which?

"First Minister Mark Drakeford and Dr Sally Lewis, clinical operational lead for Covid vaccination in Wales, have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Mr Drakeford says ""cautious"" talks have begun about the tourism sector being able to reopen in time for Easter Another 25 people have died with Covid in Wales, while more than 700,000 people have now been vaccinated, Public Health Wales says Wales is the first UK nation to have given or offered everyone in the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government says However, the NHS in Wales is checking its lists to make sure no-one has been missed, the first minister said James McCarthy and Andy Roberts That is it from Fridayâs coronavirus live page - thank you for joining us. Here are today's headlines:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. Stay safe, and have a good weekend. BBC Radio Wales When Wales was locked down to try to stop the spread of coronavirus,comedian Lorna Prichardthought it would put a halt to her planned return to the world of dating. But the film fan from Cardiff went online, found her hero and fell in love. Hear the story of how she found her happy ending inWhen Lorna Met Leo: Love in the Time of Covidfrom BBC Radio Wales. Front-line police officers and staff should be on a daily reserve list for spare vaccines that would otherwise go to waste, the Police Federationâs Welsh lead has said. Mark Bleasdale reiterated calls for police to be prioritised in the roll-out programme for Covid jabs. âThe frustration level among front-line officers is high,"" he said. ""This is because they are not being given any priority in the first phase of the roll-out of the jabs. ""But this has now been compounded by the fact that we are hearing of a wastage rate of âonly 1%â which, based on 600,000 first dose vaccinations being administered, is still 6,000 doses."" Mr Bleasdale said he believed 5,000 doses would be enough for all front-line officers and staff in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he thinks ""we're going to see a bit more fluidity"" between the next five priority groups for Covid vaccination in the second stage of the programme in Wales, compared to the first phase. ""We won't be going just 'five, six, seven' down the line - people will be called in for vaccination across the five groups,"" he said. ""That's because we have so many hundreds of thousands of people to vaccinate that the system will need a bit of flexibility to make sure that every single appointment can be kept and every single dose of vaccine can be used."" But Dr Sally Lewis, who is leading Wales' vaccination programme, added: ""Of course, we want to immunise the most vulnerable first. ""For example, those who may be severely immunosuppressed, we would want to try and reach those people first,"" she said.

She is part ofa team of 16, based in Cardiff, that has been able to sequence between 15 and 20% of all positive cases in Wales since Covid arrived, one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. Ms Hey, who only started three months ago, prepares samples selected at random from positive Covid tests across and helps to look for tiny differences between the samples in the virus's genetic code. She said her work is ""very different"" from when she was a zoology student but ""exciting"". Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have welcomed the Welsh Governmentâs announcement that it has met its first vaccination âmilestoneâ. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales wasthe first UK nation to meet the target of giving or offering a Covid vaccine to everyone in the four top priority groups. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was âfantastic news and  a cause for celebrationâ. He added: âWeâre motoring now so letâs keep up this pace â itâs Wales at its best with everyone on the ground working together."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: âItâs a great news story after a bleak winter and we thank everyone involved."" He added: âThereâs still 80% of the population to be vaccinated and thereâs still a long way to go.â Wales isthe first UK nation to meet the target of offering a Covid vaccine to the four top priority groups, First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed today. But he stressed there was no âcompetitionâ with other countries, which are expected to hit the same milestone in the next few days. All four UK nations are aiming to offer a vaccine to the over-70s, health care workers, care home staff and care home residents by mid-February. Mr Drakeford said: âWeâre the first UK nation to reach this milestone, others will follow in a couple of days. âWeâre not in competition with each other.  Every part of the UK is working as hard as it can to get to this milestone.â Wales' first minister has said if current progress against coronavirus continues to be maintained, the authorities could ""slowly and cautiously"" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter ""in all aspects of our lives"". Mark Drakeford said this included tourism, but depended on Wales continuing to see reductions in infection levels, as well as ""the impact on our health service being drained away"" and ""our vaccination programme delivering what we hope it will do in terms of the protection it will offer to people"". He said: ""If that is the path we are on, then the pattern in Wales, as we move towards the spring and Easter, will be one in which we will be able to slowly and cautiously lift the restrictions that are currently in place in all aspects of our lives. ""That will include the tourism industry and it'll include those aspects of family life which are denied to us all at the moment, but that is a path that depends upon continuing success. ""And we've learned so often, haven't we, over the last 12 months coronavirus continues to have very unpleasant surprises up its sleeve."" A target date for giving all people aged over 50 in Wales their first Covid-19 vaccine will be announced in the next few days, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. With all those over 70 due to have been given a vaccine or appointment by Sunday, attention is turning to the next priority groups. The current stated aim is to offer a vaccine to those over 50, and younger people who have serious health conditions, by spring. But Mr Drakeford said a more detailed target would be set. âWe will say something more specific than we have said so far,â he said. âOnce we have got through this next couple of weeks, and weâre completely certain that the first four groups are behind us, then we will say something a little more definite about when we expect the next five groups to be completed.â Mr Drakeford said there was no indication of any further slowdown in supply of the vaccine after the next fortnight, when there will be a reduction.

Supplies would then accelerate in March, he said. Wales' first minister says although more than one in five people in Wales has had the first vaccine dose, ânow the hard work really begins as we move on to the next priority groups"". Mark Drakeford said: âOver the next few weeks, we will see a slight reduction in the amount of vaccine we receive, especially compared to levels we have had over the last few weeks. âThis is a planned, UK-wide issue. âWe have factored this into our vaccination plans, and it wonât affect peopleâs appointments, and it wonât delay when people are due to get their second dose."" The first minister said that over the next few months, the vaccine would be offered to everyone in groups five to nine. He confirmed this would include ""everyone aged 50 to 69, everyone over 16 who has an underlying health condition, which puts them at increased risk, and a great many unpaid carers who provide care for someone who is vulnerable to the virusâ. Dr Sally Lewis, the clinical operational lead for Wales' Covid vaccination programme, said the first milestone had been reached due to a âmassive collaborative effortâ. She said this approach would continue for the next six months. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said all people in the top four priority groups in Wales have now had a jab or been offered one, with the focus now turning to the next five groups. Dr Lewis said more work needed to be carried out into encouraging people with concerns about vaccines to come forward for vaccination. âWe need to increase confidence where there is vaccine hesitancyâ, she said. First Minister Mark Drakeford is urging anyone from the first four priority groups in Wales who hasnât been contacted about getting a vaccination to get in touch with their local health board. Mr Drakeford said take-up of the vaccine had been incredibly high with the latest figures showing more than 715,000 people had had the first dose of the vaccine. âWe want to make sure that no one from these first four groups is left behind,"" he said. âIf youâve changed your mind about having the vaccine or missed your appointment because of illness, you havenât missed out on your chance of having the vaccine. âThe NHS is checking and rechecking its lists to make sure it hasnât missed anyone and will be continuing to invite people to come forward through the weekend. âEvery health board has dedicated phone lines and email addresses for people in these first four groups to get in touch to arrange an appointment. âWeâve put these on our website too,â he added. First Minister Mark Drakeford says the first milestone in the Welsh Governmentâs vaccination strategy has been met withvaccines offered to all people in the first four priority groups. Speaking at today's coronavirus briefing, he said: âAt the beginning of December, Wales became one of the first countries in the world to start vaccinating people against coronavirus. âToday, just 66 days later, I am incredibly proud to say we have achieved the first milestone in our vaccination strategy. âThis means we have offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups. âThatâs everyone over 70, all front-line health and social care workers, everyone living and working in older peopleâs care homes and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable.""

"A documentary that examined the singer's conservatorship was released last week A judge has denied a request by Britney Spears' father to exert greater control over her finances. Jamie Spears has controlled his daughter's financial affairs since 2008, but the singer has recently indicated she wants him removed. On Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer. The judge rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments. The ruling means Mr Spears and the private trust company, Bessemer Trust, will now have equal power to manage her finances. As a result, he is now expected to work with the company to create a budget and investment proposal for the singer's estate. The conservatorship is a legal arrangement that was put in place because of concerns about her mental health. Los Angeles Judge Brenda Penny appointed Bessemer Trust as co-conservators in November, but rejected the star's effort to remove her father entirely. Fans from the Free Britney campaign gathered outside the court on Thursday Jamie Spears had objected to Bessemer's involvement, arguing that it reduced the power he has held for years. Judge Perry threw out his objection on Thursday. Another hearing is scheduled for 17 March. Britney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III has previously said the singer is ""afraid"" of her father and does not want him to control her finances and career. On Thursday, Mr Ingham reiterated the pop star's wish, adding that it was ""no secret"" she didn't want her father to be a co-conservator, but acknowledged that removing him altogether would be a ""separate issue"". Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Why a court battle is fuelling #FreeBritney calls Interest in the case has been renewed after the recent release of a documentary that focuses on the conflict over the singer's guardianship. Framing Britney Spears, which was produced by The New York Times, examined the conservatorship in depth, as well as how the singer has been treated by the media throughout her career. It also explored the #FreeBritney movement, a campaign by some of the star's fans who believe her life and career are being controlled against her will. Campaigners from the group were outside the hearing on Thursday. Jamie Spears and Britney, pictured in 2006 Babs Gray, host of the BritneyGram podcast, told the BBC outside the court: ""It hasn't changed anything much today... I don't think a lot of forward movement will happen until Britney's lawyer actually files to get her out of the conservatorship."" She said interest in the #FreeBritney issue had ""exploded"" in the past week as a result of the documentary. ""It's been really encouraging to see how supportive everyone is about the movement, how they are reckoning with how Britney was treated in the past,"" she said. ""I hope its not just a flash in the pan. I hope people keep paying attention and keep putting the pressure on."" Britney Spears hasn't performed live for more than two years, and insists she has no intention of doing so again until her father is forced to relinquish control over her career.

"A Netflix series about her crimes, Inventing Anna, is already under production A German woman who posed as a billionaire heiress in New York has been released from prison. Anna Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy socialite named Anna Delvey, was released from prison on Thursday, according to US media reports. She was found guilty in 2019 of theft of services and grand larceny, having scammed more than $200,000 (Â£145,000) from banks and luxury hotels. It is thought Sorokin could now face deportation. Her release comes months after she reportedly apologised at a parole hearing in October last year. ""I just want to say that I'm really ashamed and I'm really sorry for what I did,""the New York Post, who obtained a transcript, quoted Sorokin as saying,external. ""I completely understand that a lot of people suffered when I thought I was not doing anything wrong."" A lawyer for Sorokin previously told Insider that she was trying to appeal against her conviction, despite her planned parole release. During her trial prosecutors told how Sorokin, under the assumed name of Anna Delvey, pretended she was worth about $60m with a trust fund in Europe. The trial of New York's fake heiress 'My strange encounters with Anna Delvey' Why are we fascinated by con artists? Listen to the podcast Fake Heiress on BBC Sounds Maintaining the scam for several years, Sorokin used her phony persona to facilitate a luxury lifestyle where she lived in a lavish New York hotel and ate out at stylish restaurants. Anna Sorokin (right), then known as Anna Delvey, tried to get a $22m loan for a foundation in her name Prosecutors said she used forged financial documents to maintain the charade and even managed to get a $100,000 overdraft loan from one bank. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, argued in court that Sorokin had tried to ""fake it until she could make it"" and had been ""easily seduced by glamour and glitz"" of life in New York. Headlines about her trial often focused on her fashion choices after she employed a courtroom stylist and one day refused to appear in front of the judge because of her outfit. Ultimately Sorokin was found guilty of eight counts and acquitted of two others. Her story came to international attention in 2018 after a hit New York Magazine feature by writer Jessica Pressler. That story is now being turned into a Netflix series produced by Shonda Rhimes, behind hit TV shows Grey's Anatomy and Scandal. Last month Insider reported thatSorokin had used most of the $320,000 fee she was paid for the show,externalto pay restitution to banks and other fines. Another project about Sorokin's con, based on a book by a former friend, was previously announced by HBO. Why are we fascinated by con artists?

"Photo of the damage caused by the blaze at Tavy Cleave A large blaze which broke out on Dartmoor has been extinguished, fire crews said. The fire engulfed a 5km (3.1 miles) strip ofremote moorland near Tavistock, Devonon Thursday night. Devon and Somerset Fire Service said the fire was out at about 10:00 GMT and the cause is being investigated. It described the blaze as ""extremely dangerous"" due to windy conditions and low visibility. No injuries have been reported. The fire service said ""natural fire breaks"" in the area had helped contain the blaze, which burned out on its own overnight. A spokesperson said the cause of the fire is now under investigation. Fire service incident commander Mike Porter said natural fire breaks on the moor - including granite, roads and the River Tavy - all helped contain the fire. ""There was a planned strategy to fight the fire defensively with close monitoring overnight,"" he explained. Dartmoor National Park said any damage from the fire would primarily be to the surface of the moor because of the ""very wet"" ground underneath the surface and ""regrowth will not be a problem"" for the affected area.

People could see the flames light up the night sky about 20 miles (32km) away in Plymouth on Thursday evening. Ten vehicles were used to monitor the blaze overnight, with firefighters also using drones and other spotters to observe the spread. There have been several wildfires in the South West in recent days, with anotherthree-mile wide blaze near Bodmin, Cornwallon Thursday and a blazesuspected to be caused by arsonon a Cornish nature reserve on Tuesday. Wildfire scientist Dr Thomas Smith from the London School of Economics said these incidents were ""not unusual"" in cold weather, as air temperature is ""not particularly important"" in flames igniting or spreading. He said: ""The driving or spreading of fire is all about moisture in the air and plants."" He explained current dry winds blowing across England from Europe ""favour the conditions for a fire to ignite and spread"", as they dry out plant material acting as fuel. ""Then all you need really is a source of ignition with the wind on the moors for a fire to spread,"" he said. ""There are all of the ingredients right now in the South West for wildfires."" The fire service was forced to operate in ""defensive mode"", preventing the spread of the flames until conditions improved. It said some people were seen trying to watch and photograph the fire. They tweeted: ""This is extremely dangerous and certainly not an essential journey! Please stay away from the area for your own safety."" Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed officers had attended the scene following reports of ""members of the public gathering"". No fines for coronavirus lockdown breaches were issued, the force said. The RSPB said it was ""highly unlikely"" local birds were directly affected by the flames, as it is months before the nesting season begins and birds are very mobile. A spokesperson added it ""remains to be seen"" what the longer term implications of the fire are for local habitats.

"Mark Drakeford said they were talking to the Welsh tourist industry ""about what might be possible around the Easter period"" ""Cautious"" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter have started, the first minister said. But Mark Drakeford said the sector - which supports 10% of the Welsh workforce or 120,000 jobs - would not be opened ""in one go"". Although he did not rule it out, Mr Drakeford also suggested it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April. He said a revised plan out of lockdown would be published ""within days"". The Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". Wales 'first in UK to hit' February vaccine target Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ministers were talking to the Welsh tourist industry, worth Â£6.3bn to the Welsh economy, ""about what might be possible around the Easter period"". Wales' lockdownis set to be reviewed on 19 February and the first minister said it was all ""very much caveated"" and dependant on Covid infection rates and variants of the virus. Tourism bosses are keen to see resorts such as Llandudno in north Wales reopen to visitors Mr Drakeford said if progress against Covid continued, the authorities could ""slowly and cautiously"" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter ""in all aspects of our lives"". Currently, all indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions, non-essential shops, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation are shut. Three to seven-year-old childrenwill be able to return to school in Walesfrom 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses. The potential phased reopening of schools for the remainder of primary age children and college students will be the priority at the next three-week Covid lockdown review - and Mr Drakeford said there would only be room for some other ""modest"" changes at most. This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the success of the vaccine rollout is due to the ""phenomenal effort"" of all involved. Asked whether the return of more pupils to face-to-face teaching would be his government's priority for the following review on 12 March, the first minister said ""schools will remain our top priority"" if there was ""further headroom available to us"". ""But, of course, there are other things we know that matter a great deal to people and if we were in a position safely to do anything else to lift the restrictions that is what we would do,"" Mr Drakeford added. The first minister said he ""absolutely"" understood the need to give the tourism industry ""some forward notice"" if a partial reopening was allowed for the Easter break. Tourists returned to Llandudno in the summer, despite the pandemic But he said: ""Nobody should think that what we're talking about here is the wholesale reopening of the tourist industry in one go."" Asked if that meant it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would also be open at Easter, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't want to rule things out quite in that way. ""The way we'll have to do it will be step by step, using what headroom we have, never doing too many things that put us back in danger. ""It will not be safe to lift restrictions over too many things all at once. That means prioritising things."" The first minister said the Welsh Government's ""cautious approach"" would likely focus on the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation in the first instance. Mr Drakeford saidÂ anyoneÂ booking a holiday should do so ""knowing theÂ uncertain world that we are living in and that there are no guarantees"". The chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance called on the UK and Welsh governments to work together as ""80% of our tourism market is across the border in England"". Italianate style village Portmeirion in Gwynedd is a popular attraction Andrew Campbell said there was an ""awful lot of planning"" needed before reopening as ""you don't just turn a switch on"". ""There's always been cautious optimism that we could get going again in April, but Easter would be simply wonderful,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales ""If we go and open and England are still in lockdown that will cause problems - we need to have those discussions,"" Mr Campbell added. Llandudno hotel owner Lynette Esposito said she had been getting a ""substantial number of new inquiries"" Lynette Esposito, owner of the Elm Tree hotel in Llandudno, said she felt ""optimistic"" after the first minister's comments. But she said coming out of lockdown for Welsh businesses should be ""aligned with England"" as that accounted for ""the bulk of their business"". ""I think in terms of a timeline it is critical we are being given sufficient time, for us to be able to get the place cleaned up and start trade,"" she said. She added she thought it would be useful for hospitality staff to get ""some advantage as to getting a vaccine"" as they would be ""frontline people reopening the economy"". Ms Esposito said they had been seeing a ""substantial number of new inquiries"" from people who had never visited Wales before. ""There is no doubt there is demand out there, but people are still cautious,"" she said. The BBCÂ Holidays at HomeÂ show declared Three Cliffs Bay Britain's best beach in 2006 Meanwhile, the Three Cliffs Holiday Park in the Gower has seen a surge in bookings after the first minister's ""positive outlook for this summer"". ""It's lovely to have so much enthusiasm,"" said owner Tom Beynon. Well, a number of figures need to continue fall - namely average case rates, test positivity rates and Covid hospital patient numbers. Wales currently has the lowest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, with a seven-day average of 102 cases per 100,000 - a dramatic fall from before Christmas, where it had the highest in the UK with 603. The number of hospital patients in Wales was at record levels at the start of January - now it is at its lowest daily average since 20 December. Covid positivity rate in Wales now stands at 8.7% - its lowest point since 8 October. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the proportion of positive tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions. The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) has issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance. In its latest report it said if restrictions were lifted ""too early or too quickly"", there was a ""high likelihood of returning to current levels of infections and hospitalisations in those scenarios"". It said thereproduction (R) numbercontinues to be within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9 - it has been within this range for a few weeks and is down from the period just after Christmas when it was between 0.8 and 1.1. It means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales about seven people would become infected. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". He said: ""As we hit these important vaccination milestones and with the latest review due at the end of next week, it's important ministers now devise a roadmap out of lockdown, providing timescales where possible and appropriate for schools, families, workers and businesses."" Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said any easing would not happen quickly, adding: ""What we don't want to do is have a rapid opening up and a rapid resurgence of the virus."" On Thursday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was""too early""to know whether summer holidays could go ahead, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to urge the UK Government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce a""gradual and phased""plan out of lockdown for England on 22 February.

"The report said the rates of children saying they felt worried ""most of the time"" were ""notably higher"" during the current lockdown The pandemic is having a ""crushing impact"" on children and young people's lives, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has said. It comes as a report into the impact of the current Covid lockdown revealed how 30% of 17 and 18-year-olds said they were worried ""most of the time"". The views of 20,000 children and teenagers in Wales were represented in the report by Prof Sally Holland. One teenager feels ""more isolated, less motivated"" than in previous lockdowns. The report, called Coronavirus and Me, is the second commissioned by Prof Holland,who ran a similar survey in May during the first lockdown. The new one found ""markedly fewer"" of the 12 to 18-year-olds who responded to the online survey saying they were happy ""most of the time"". It said the rates of children saying they felt worried ""most of the time"" were ""notably higher"" during the current lockdown. Prof Holland said: ""It is obvious from these survey results that, despite the enormous efforts of our schools, colleges, youth workers, social services and health services, the pandemic is having a crushing impact on many young lives."" She added it was clear children and young people of all ages were ""missing not only formal learning but also the socialisation and support that school and college has to offer"". In Wales, schools and colleges have been shut since Christmas when there were rising rates of Covid infections. Foundation phase pupils are due to start a phased return to school from the Monday after half-term,although some local authority areas have said they might have to delay reopeningbecause of concerns over infection rates. Eighteen-year-old Ellie Kidd, who is studying for a Level 3 BTEC in sport, said she had been finding this lockdown tougher than the first. ""I've definitely struggled with my mental health through this lockdown in particular,"" said Ellie, who lives in Flintshire. ""I just feel more isolated, less motivated. I can call my friends but it doesn't feel the same as having the social interaction. It's been quite difficult."" Ellie Kidd, 18, said she had been finding the current lockdown tougher than the first She said she was often in the house alone as her mother and step-father were both keyworkers. She added: ""I had a week after Christmas when I felt very low, I kept thinking, 'How are we going to get out of this?'. I know there are vaccines now but sometimes I just keep thinking, 'when is it going to end?'."" The report said children as young as three described missing friends, relatives and experiences and 40% of 17-year-olds reported they felt lonely 'most of the time'. It also found children and young people of black, Asian and other ethnic minority ethnicities and disabled youngsters were more likely to feel lonely and less likely to say they feel safe. However, the report also found many children and young people said they were enjoying spending time at home and were receiving good support from schools and youth workers. Luca Zenati-Parsons, 15, said he preferred working in his own time Luca Zenati-Parsons, 15, said his schoolwork had been improving during lockdown. ""I get to do it in my own time and on my own - there's no-one being loud in class,"" said Luca, from Caerphilly, who usually goes to school in Pontypridd. ""I prefer to be in my own little zone."" Prof Holland said she hoped the results of the report would give a ""clear road-map"" for the Welsh Government on what needed to be prioritised for children and young people over the next weeks and months. The report's findings have already been shared with the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) and she said it would also be sent to SAGE, the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. She added the first priority for students returning to schools and colleges may need to be ""providing time to talk about their experiences, opportunities to be with friends and to play and also the chance to reflect on and be proud of what they have achieved during the pandemic"". A Welsh Government spokesperson said the results of the survey from May had been used ""extensively"" to decision on policy ranging from education to recent alert levels. They added: ""The new set of findings will now also be considered as a key source of evidence when future decisions are made.""

"This video can not be played Prof Pearson said the remains of a cow, which was found at the site, suggested animals may have helped to pull the stones to their resting spot in England One of Britain's biggest and oldest stone circles has been found in Wales - and could be the original building blocks of Stonehenge. Archaeologists uncovered the remains of the Waun Mawn site in Pembrokeshire's Preseli Hills. They believe the stones could have been dismantled and rebuilt 150 miles (240 km) away on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire. The discovery was made during filming for BBC Two's Stonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed. The Welsh circle, believed to be the third biggest in Britain, has a diameter of 360ft (110m), the same as the ditch that encloses Stonehenge, and both are aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise. Solved: Mystery of where Stonehenge's stones come from Stonehenge: First residents from west Wales Patrols aim to tackle heritage crime in Wales Several of the monoliths at the World Heritage Site are of the same rock type as those that still remain at the Welsh site. And one of the bluestones at Stonehenge has an unusual cross-section which matches one of the holes left at Waun Mawn, suggesting the monolith began its life as part of the stone circle in the Preseli Hills before being moved. Archaeologists unearthed the ancient stone circle at Waun Mawn in the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire Multiple large ""stone holes"" were found at Waun Mawn It is already known that thesmaller bluestones that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire. But the new discovery suggests the bluestones from Waun Mawn could have been moved as the ancient people of the Preseli region migrated, even taking their monuments with them, as a sign of their ancestral identity. They would then have been re-erected at Stonehenge. Archaeologists said this could explain why the bluestones, thought to be the first monoliths erected at Stonehenge, were brought from so far away, while most circles are constructed within a short distance of their quarries. The team was working in bad weather in the Preseli Hills when the circle was discovered The archaeological investigations as part of the Stones of Stonehenge research project, led by Professor Mike Parker Pearson of University College London, previously excavated two bluestone quarries in the Preseli Hills. Their discovery that the bluestones had been extracted before the first stage of Stonehenge was built in 3000 BC prompted the team to re-investigate the nearby Waun Mawn stones to see if it was the site of a stone circle supplied by the quarry and later moved. Only four monoliths remain at the site, but an archaeological dig in 2018 revealed holes where stones would have stood, showing the remaining stones were part of a wider circle of 30-50 stones. And the scientific dating of charcoal and sediment from the holes reveal it was put up around 3400 BC. EXPLORE WALES FROM HOME:Discover Wales with series' that celebrate the history, wildlife, and landscape of Wales 'RHOD GILBERT: STAND UP TO INFERTILITY':Rhod shares the emotional turmoil, theories and misconceptions about male infertility The Preseli Hills are 150 miles (240 km) from Stonehenge in Wiltshire Findings of the discovery, published in the journal Antiquity, show significant links between Stonehenge and Waun Mawn. It also confirms that the region was an important and densely settled area in Neolithic times until 3000 BC when activity seems to have ceased. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""It's as if they just vanished. Maybe most of the people migrated, taking their stones - their ancestral identities - with them."" Analysis of the remains of people buried at Stonehenge at the time the bluestones were erected there would seem to back up the theory, as it shows some of them were from western Britain, possibly Wales. With only a few of the Stonehenge stones directly linked to Waun Mawn, the archaeologists also believe monoliths from other stone circles could have been taken from Wales to form part of the new monument. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""With an estimated 80 bluestones put up on Salisbury Plain at Stonehenge and nearby Bluestonehenge, my guess is that Waun Mawn was not the only stone circle that contributed to Stonehenge. ""Maybe there are more in Preseli waiting to be found. Who knows? Someone will be lucky enough to find them.""

The fire engulfed a 5km (3.1 miles) strip ofremote moorland near Tavistock, Devonon Thursday night. Devon and Somerset Fire Service said the fire was out at about 10:00 GMT and the cause is being investigated. It described the blaze as ""extremely dangerous"" due to windy conditions and low visibility. No injuries have been reported. The fire service said ""natural fire breaks"" in the area had helped contain the blaze, which burned out on its own overnight. A spokesperson said the cause of the fire is now under investigation. Fire service incident commander Mike Porter said natural fire breaks on the moor - including granite, roads and the River Tavy - all helped contain the fire. ""There was a planned strategy to fight the fire defensively with close monitoring overnight,"" he explained. Dartmoor National Park said any damage from the fire would primarily be to the surface of the moor because of the ""very wet"" ground underneath the surface and ""regrowth will not be a problem"" for the affected area.

People could see the flames light up the night sky about 20 miles (32km) away in Plymouth on Thursday evening. Ten vehicles were used to monitor the blaze overnight, with firefighters also using drones and other spotters to observe the spread. There have been several wildfires in the South West in recent days, with anotherthree-mile wide blaze near Bodmin, Cornwallon Thursday and a blazesuspected to be caused by arsonon a Cornish nature reserve on Tuesday. Wildfire scientist Dr Thomas Smith from the London School of Economics said these incidents were ""not unusual"" in cold weather, as air temperature is ""not particularly important"" in flames igniting or spreading. He said: ""The driving or spreading of fire is all about moisture in the air and plants."" He explained current dry winds blowing across England from Europe ""favour the conditions for a fire to ignite and spread"", as they dry out plant material acting as fuel. ""Then all you need really is a source of ignition with the wind on the moors for a fire to spread,"" he said. ""There are all of the ingredients right now in the South West for wildfires."" The fire service was forced to operate in ""defensive mode"", preventing the spread of the flames until conditions improved. It said some people were seen trying to watch and photograph the fire. They tweeted: ""This is extremely dangerous and certainly not an essential journey! Please stay away from the area for your own safety."" Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed officers had attended the scene following reports of ""members of the public gathering"". No fines for coronavirus lockdown breaches were issued, the force said. The RSPB said it was ""highly unlikely"" local birds were directly affected by the flames, as it is months before the nesting season begins and birds are very mobile. A spokesperson added it ""remains to be seen"" what the longer term implications of the fire are for local habitats.

"This video can not be played Prof Pearson said the remains of a cow, which was found at the site, suggested animals may have helped to pull the stones to their resting spot in England One of Britain's biggest and oldest stone circles has been found in Wales - and could be the original building blocks of Stonehenge. Archaeologists uncovered the remains of the Waun Mawn site in Pembrokeshire's Preseli Hills. They believe the stones could have been dismantled and rebuilt 150 miles (240 km) away on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire. The discovery was made during filming for BBC Two's Stonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed. The Welsh circle, believed to be the third biggest in Britain, has a diameter of 360ft (110m), the same as the ditch that encloses Stonehenge, and both are aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise. Solved: Mystery of where Stonehenge's stones come from Stonehenge: First residents from west Wales Patrols aim to tackle heritage crime in Wales Several of the monoliths at the World Heritage Site are of the same rock type as those that still remain at the Welsh site. And one of the bluestones at Stonehenge has an unusual cross-section which matches one of the holes left at Waun Mawn, suggesting the monolith began its life as part of the stone circle in the Preseli Hills before being moved. Archaeologists unearthed the ancient stone circle at Waun Mawn in the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire Multiple large ""stone holes"" were found at Waun Mawn It is already known that thesmaller bluestones that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire. But the new discovery suggests the bluestones from Waun Mawn could have been moved as the ancient people of the Preseli region migrated, even taking their monuments with them, as a sign of their ancestral identity. They would then have been re-erected at Stonehenge. Archaeologists said this could explain why the bluestones, thought to be the first monoliths erected at Stonehenge, were brought from so far away, while most circles are constructed within a short distance of their quarries. The team was working in bad weather in the Preseli Hills when the circle was discovered The archaeological investigations as part of the Stones of Stonehenge research project, led by Professor Mike Parker Pearson of University College London, previously excavated two bluestone quarries in the Preseli Hills. Their discovery that the bluestones had been extracted before the first stage of Stonehenge was built in 3000 BC prompted the team to re-investigate the nearby Waun Mawn stones to see if it was the site of a stone circle supplied by the quarry and later moved. Only four monoliths remain at the site, but an archaeological dig in 2018 revealed holes where stones would have stood, showing the remaining stones were part of a wider circle of 30-50 stones. And the scientific dating of charcoal and sediment from the holes reveal it was put up around 3400 BC.

It also confirms that the region was an important and densely settled area in Neolithic times until 3000 BC when activity seems to have ceased. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""It's as if they just vanished. Maybe most of the people migrated, taking their stones - their ancestral identities - with them."" Analysis of the remains of people buried at Stonehenge at the time the bluestones were erected there would seem to back up the theory, as it shows some of them were from western Britain, possibly Wales. With only a few of the Stonehenge stones directly linked to Waun Mawn, the archaeologists also believe monoliths from other stone circles could have been taken from Wales to form part of the new monument. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""With an estimated 80 bluestones put up on Salisbury Plain at Stonehenge and nearby Bluestonehenge, my guess is that Waun Mawn was not the only stone circle that contributed to Stonehenge.

"England's rules on quarantine hotels for travellers arriving from Covid ""red list"" countries are less stringent than those enforced in Australia. The BBC has seen a copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operatorsahead of the policy starting on Monday.,external It spells out the rules for handling travellers for 11 nights of quarantine. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". And it promised to update guidance for hotels ""imminently"". UK's hotel quarantine site taken down after launch 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine What are the new rules for travel? Australia's system, introduced early last year, is seen as among the best internationally. But as a result of repeated outbreaks among staff and guests, and the arrival of new variants, the rules in Australia have been tightened and are under review again. It comes as the Australian state of Victoriaenters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdownin a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. UK Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the system being introduced was ""very strong"" and its ""standards are amongst the strongest in the world"". ""We keep these measures under review,"" she added. In Australia, people staying in quarantine hotels are not allowed to leave their rooms. This follows incidents in the early months of the pandemic when security guards and hotel guests were seen to mingle, and were blamed for spreading the virus. One of these outbreaks led to a surge in cases that forced Melbourne into a five-month lockdown. A hotel quarantine worker tested positive for coronavirus in Melbourne recently However the authorities in England have issued a conflicting array of messages about policy on this, with No 10 and the Department of Health and Social Care forced to issue several clarifications. The upshot is that travellers will be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. In New Zealand, smoking breaks are allowed, under escort, but with strict guidance not to get close to anyone else. Policy on this changed in Australia after the risks of meal service became apparent. A woman from Singapore who tested negative during most of her stay became infected with the same variant of coronavirus found in a family of five from Nigeria in the room opposite. There's no definitive explanation for how she caught the virus but one suggestion is that the doors of both rooms were opened at the same time to collect meals. Can I book a holiday in the UK? Lessons from Australia's hotel quarantine system Melbourne's hard-won success after a marathon lockdown Officials say the viral load in the air in the family's room - with all five of them being infected - could have meant that the virus was carried through the air across the corridor. It's one reason why hotel staff now deliver meals at staggered times to avoid everyone opening their doors at the same time. The UK guidance states that room service will be ""undertaken in full compliance of Covid-19 prevention best practice"". The government said meals would be served three times per day, but did not comment on specific timings. There is growing evidence of the risks of the virus being transmitted through the air either between rooms or between rooms and public areas such as corridors. A security guard who spent the day on duty in a corridor caught the virus despite having no contact with anyone. This video can not be played See inside a five-star quarantine hotel A widely-held assumption is that infectious aerosols had accumulated in the air in this poorly-ventilated space and had led to his infection. In the state of Victoria, hotel staff now have to be equipped with a type of mask known as an N95, roughly equivalent to what is called an FFP2 in the UK. By contrast, the document issued to UK hotels spells out that standard surgical masks must be worn - these are thinner and are thought to be less effective at blocking aerosols. Which masks offer the most protection? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors How can you keep yourself and your family safe? It also says that if emergency maintenance is needed before a room has been disinfected and left vacant for 72 hours, staff should wear PPE that is ""consistent with droplet precautions"". Droplets are produced by coughs and heavy exhalations and are generally judged to be a risk over a distance of up to two metres. There is no specific guidance on the protection needed to guard against aerosols that can linger in the air. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, is among scientists pushing for hotel staff to be better equipped. ""I truly believe that if you're putting workers in harm's way, which essentially you are, by putting them in a quarantine hotel, and exposing them to people potentially with Covid-19, that there's a duty of care that those people have the highest possible protection from infection."" Following infections among hotel staff in Australia, and amid fears of the new variants, all employees are tested for coronavirus every day. That includes days off, with a requirement that staff are paid for those days. However, the UK document does not suggest any provision for regular testing. England's Department of Health said plans for a ""bespoke service"" for staff testing were being developed but it could not confirm whether it would be ready for the start of the policy on Monday. The government added that all staff working in England's quarantine hotels would be provided with regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. A government spokesperson said: ""We have taken decisive action at the border and every essential check from pre-departure testing, to the passenger locator form and the suspension of travel routes strengthens our borders and prevents the spread coronavirus into the UK."" Ministers have said they have ""shared expertise"" with the Australian government about quarantine, but questions will be raised about whether the lessons learned are being followed. 39 WAYS TO SAVE THE PLANET:Tom Heap offers up fresh and fascinating ideas to cut carbon ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL?:Learn new things with Greg James and Bella Mackie from Britain's most inspiring teachers Hotel quarantine site taken down after launch Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' How are travel rules being relaxed?

"The violent riot at the US Capitol on 6 January saw five people lose their lives Democrats have finished their arguments that Donald Trump incited the attack on the US Congress, warning ""he can do this again"" if he is not convicted. Impeachment prosecutors used rioters' own words to link Mr Trump to the violence while arguing last month's riot had caused long-term harm as well. Democrats also presented accounts from police, staff, intelligence officials and foreign media to pursue their case. The former president's defence team will present their arguments on Friday. Did Trump's words at rally incite violence? Trump lawyer offers bewildering defence statement 'They thought they were going to die' The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Mr Trump last month, accusing him of inciting the riot on the Capitol building on 6 January. Lawmakers from the House have been presenting their case to senators at his trial this week. Mr Trump's lawyers have argued he was using his right to freedom of speech when declaring last November's presidential election fraudulent. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, former President Trump is accused of having incited insurrection What has already happened?The House of Representatives voted to impeach Mr Trump for a second time on 13 January, a week before the end of his term. The Senate is now holding a trial So what does it mean?As he is no longer president senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again - but only if he is convicted A two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate, but an acquittal looks likely as the vast majority of Republican senators have remained loyal to him so far. If Mr Trump is convicted, however, the Senate could also vote to bar him from holding elected office again. The violent riot at the Capitol, which saw five people lose their lives, was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified. This video can not be played The prosecution's closing argument: ""We humbly ask you to convict President Trump"" On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Mr Trump is accused of inciting. Democrats sought to detail how Mr Trump sparked the attack on the Capitol and presented evidence that took senators step-by-step through the events of the day of the riot. On Thursday, they embarked on the final point of their prosecution: the harm they say Mr Trump caused to property, people and democracy. ""Because impeachment, conviction and disqualification [from office] is not just about the past. It's about the future,"" Congressman Ted Lieu told the trial, after arguing Mr Trump had shown no remorse for his actions. ""It's making sure that no future official, no future president does the same exact thing."" Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Police describe a 'medieval battle' House prosecutor Joe Neguse made the case that Mr Trump was ""not just some guy"" making a controversial speech - he was a president addressing supporters who were ""poised for violence [and] he struck a match"". This video can not be played See how close the mob got to Mike Pence, Mitt Romney and other lawmakers Democrats showed clips of rioters saying they had come to Washington DC because they believed that was what then-President Trump wanted. Fellow House manager David Cicilline used video and court documents to illustrate the harm done to ""Congress and the Democratic process"". He added that some rioters admitted they planned to murder Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while others spoke of ""sealing"" lawmakers in the basement where they hid and ""turning on the gas"". ""Never did any of us imagine that we would face mortal peril by a mob riled up by the president of the United States,"" Mr Cicilline said. He also shared accounts from frightened staff who were in the Capitol during the riot. The Democratic impeachment managers have now concluded their case Democrats also argued Mr Trump's conduct caused ""long-term harm"" to both domestic security and the nation's international standing. Impeachment manager Diana DeGette argued threats from domestic extremist groups ""were and are made worse by President Trump's refusal to take accountability and his refusal to forcibly denounce what his own FBI identified as some of the most dangerous elements of our country"". Congressman Joaquin Castro said international allies were shocked by the attack while adversaries mocked the US. ""The world is watching and wondering whether we are who we say we are."" Lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin concluded by outlining questions for Donald Trump's defence team, as Mr Trump himself has refused to testify: Why did President Trump not tell his supporters to stop the attack on the Capitol as soon as he learned of it? Why did President Trump do nothing to stop the attack for at least two hours after the attack began? Why did he do nothing to send help to overwhelmed and besieged law enforcement officers for at least two hours after the attack begin? On 6 January, why did President Trump at any point that day do nothing to condemn the violent insurrection and insurrectionists? Mr Trump's Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the next two days to set out their defence. Fact-checking Trump's defence case Earlier on Thursday, Mr Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio footage they showed the Senate. A number of Republican senators have said they will vote for Mr Trump as they do not believe the constitution allows for the impeachment of a former president, despite the Senate rejecting that argument in a vote on Tuesday. Donald Trump's defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although they are already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like they are winning on numbers and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, they are probably right. Senators will then have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they do not, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Mr Trump's fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest - less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Mr Trump's last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnson's proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible - and it looks like they will get their wish. Read more from Anthony How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world.

"Sawfish fins and teeth are sold as trophies, food and medicine They are the most extraordinary of fish, resembling ""hedge trimmers with fins"". The sawfish, which is a kind of ray, is also among the most endangered of the fish living in the oceans. Once found along the coastlines of 90 countries, the animals are now presumed extinct in more than half of these, according to a new study. They are vanishing due to habitat loss and entanglement in fishing nets, experts have said. Their ""saws"", which evolved to sense and attack prey, have now become a liability, making them prone to being caught up in fishing gear. ""Through the plight of sawfish, we are documenting the first cases of a wide-ranging marine fish being driven to local extinction by overfishing,"" said Prof Nick Dulvy of Simon Fraser University (SFU) in British Columbia, Canada. 'Time is running out' to save sharks and rays ''Extinction risk' to sharks and rays Sawfish snout senses and swipes Of the five species of sawfish, three are critically endangered, while two are listed as endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Some species reach lengths of about 7m (23 ft) Previously widespread, the sawfish are now presumed extinct in 55 nations, the study said. There are 18 countries where at least one species of sawfish is missing, and 28 more where two species have disappeared. The list of countries where sawfish are extinct now includes China, Iraq, Haiti, Japan, Timor-Leste, El Salvador, Taiwan, Djibouti and Brunei. The US and Australia appear to be the last strongholds for the species, regarded as ""lifeboat nations,"" where sawfish are better protected. The study, published in Science Advances, also identified eight nations where urgent action could make a big contribution to saving the species through conservation efforts. These are Cuba, Tanzania, Colombia, Madagascar, Panama, Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka. Their teeth are easily caught in fishing nets ""While the situation is dire, we hope to offset the bad news by highlighting our informed identification of these priority nations with hope for saving sawfish in their waters,"" said Helen Yan of SFU. She said it is still possible to restore sawfish to more than 70% of their historical range, ""if we act now"". International trade in sawfish is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, but targeted and accidental killings still occur. Sawfish fins and teeth are sold as trophies, food or medicine, and as spurs for cockfighting. Sonja Fordham, a researcher of the study and president of Shark Advocates International, said there were opportunities to ""bring these extraordinary animals back from the brink"".

Prof Parker Pearson said: ""It's as if they just vanished. Maybe most of the people migrated, taking their stones - their ancestral identities - with them."" Analysis of the remains of people buried at Stonehenge at the time the bluestones were erected there would seem to back up the theory, as it shows some of them were from western Britain, possibly Wales. With only a few of the Stonehenge stones directly linked to Waun Mawn, the archaeologists also believe monoliths from other stone circles could have been taken from Wales to form part of the new monument. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""With an estimated 80 bluestones put up on Salisbury Plain at Stonehenge and nearby Bluestonehenge, my guess is that Waun Mawn was not the only stone circle that contributed to Stonehenge. ""Maybe there are more in Preseli waiting to be found. Who knows? Someone will be lucky enough to find them.""

"Tommy Ross took this picture from Kit Hill near Launceston in Cornwall A huge fire has broken out across an area of moorland in Dartmoor, Devon. Rob Steemson, Dartmoor National Park emergency officer, estimated the blaze to be about 5km (3.1 miles) wide and continuing to spread. He said the fire, which could be seen about 20 miles away in Plymouth, was being stoked by fierce south-westerly winds. The blaze is on remote moorland near Tavistock and no residents or animals are thought to have been injured. Mr Steemson said a ""watching brief"" was ongoing overnight ""because although it is affecting the moorland, it's not affecting any property or walkers or people out there"". He said he believed firefighters were not directly trying to put out the blaze because of the strength of the winds. ""All being well it will peter out when it goes out of the wind and into the river valleys,"" the emergency officer said. The fire can be seen from the hamlet of Hatt in Cornwall Ten fire service vehicles are dealing with the fire at Tavy Cleave, a Devon and Somerset Fire spokesman said, adding that members of the public should avoid the area. The area on fire was ""general moorland"", Mr Steemson said, made up of heather, gorse and bracken. He said many Dartmoor residents were trained in dealing with fires of this nature, but had not yet been asked to go out. The fire is thought to be about 5km (3.1 miles) wide Colin Sargent saw the blaze from his house at Brentor on the western edge of Dartmoor. ""It was a long line of flames and the sky was just getting redder and redder,"" he said. ""It was just a red glow in the sky like a sunset or sunrise."" Colin Sargent said the blaze looked like a sunset This fire is the latest in a spate of winter blazes, includingat a nature reserve in Cornwallanda number of them in Scotland's Western Isles, all on Wednesday. Area commander Bruce Farquharson, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said winter fires were not uncommon due to extreme cold ""curing"" or drying out vegetation, and happened in Antarctica, Norway and. Scandinavia. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""It is counter intuitive for almost everybody but the risk is there, the vegetation is tinder dry and it just takes the slightest spark to ignite the fire and it will burn very quickly and spread very quickly."" BBC weatherman David Braine said the air temperature at Okehampton on the northern edge of Dartmoor was 0C at 22:30, with wind chill making it feel like -8C. The fire on Dartmoor lit up the night sky Smoke from the flames filled the skies near Bridestowe in West Devon Are you in the area? Can you see the fire? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"The UK economy is like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"", the Bank of England's chief economist has said. Andy Haldane said consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring. He is the latest economist to forecast a sharp rebound in growth after an expected easing of restrictions. The economy is currently set to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Mr Haldane said: ""With 13 million of the most vulnerable people already vaccinated, the risk of death or hospitalisation in the UK has already probably halved. ""By the end of March, based on the current pace of vaccine rollout and government data on vulnerable groups, this risk may have been reduced by as much as three-quarters and by the end of the second quarter it will be even smaller."" UK economy 'to rebound strongly thanks to vaccine' Home working cuts creativity, says Bank economist As a result, he said health concerns would fall and restrictions lift, allowing people to return to spending and socialising. The turn in sentiment was likely to be rapid, he added - ""a light-switch being flicked rather than a dimmer-switch being turned"". ""Having been bottled in for a year, most people are desperate to get their lives, including their social lives, back. ""When given the opportunity to do so safely, they will seize it,"" he said. He said shared social experiences - from pubs to sports to cinema - would benefit, as glimpsed last summer during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. And unlike past recessions, he added, many UK households had strengthened their finances during lockdown and would have more money to spend. ""That might mean two pub, cinema or restaurant visits a week rather than one,"" he said. ""It might mean a higher-spec TV or car or house."" On top of this he said a significant number of companies had amassed cash during the crisis, which would likely be invested as restrictions started to ease. ""That would be good news for jobs, helping to recover some of the million lost so far in this crisis,"" Mr Haldane wrote. ""And it would be good news for business investment too, helping companies boost their performance and productivity - and, ultimately, the pay of their workers."" With continued government support added to the mix, he said a strong bounce-back was assured. ""The economy is poised like a coiled spring. As its energies are released, the recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget.""

"The ONS said hairdressing was one sector that recovered lost ground in December The UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show. The contraction in 2020 ""was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record"", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. However, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year. In December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased. Hospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said. This video can not be played Cancellor Rishi Sunak says the GDP slump is ""comparable to other countries"" The growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s. A double-dip is when the economy briefly recovers from recession, only to quickly sink back. A recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters where the economy contracts. What is GDP and why does it matter? Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries? ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: ""An increase in Covid-19 testing and tracing also boosted output. The economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter as a whole, despite the additional [lockdown] restrictions in November."" GDP was first measured in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the measure has never previously dropped by more than 4.1% in a year. However, the Bank of England models GDP going back centuries, and the 2020 contraction could be the worse since 1709. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Despite avoiding a double-dip recession, with output still well below pre-pandemic levels amid confirmation that 2020 was a historically bleak year for the UK economy, there is little to cheer in the latest data."" All four economic sectors tracked by the ONS saw a drop in output, with the highest fall coming in the construction sector, which contracted by 12.5%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that last year our economy experienced a significant shock, and also some signs of resilience over winter. ""You know what's clear is right now, many families and businesses are experiencing hardship. That's why we've put in place a comprehensive plan for jobs to support people through this crisis, and we will set out the next stage of our economic response at our Budget in early March."" Economy like a coiled spring, says Bank economist But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""These figures confirm that not only has the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, we're experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy. ""Businesses can't wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions."" However, Mr Sunak said international economic comparisons were not necessarily a useful yardstick. ""We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else. And if you either correct for that difference or look at it in a way that's more comfortable with nominal GDP, what you find, as the Bank of England and the ONS have pointed out, is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries."" Economists said that with Covid-19 restrictions expected to remain until early spring, the hit to the economy will continue over the next few months. ""We anticipate a sharp decline in activity during the first quarter of the year,"" said Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme."" As expected the economy stabilised in the last quarter of 2020. But the latest set of statistics confirm the scale of the hit over the whole of last year. A technical return to recession has been avoided, with the economy returning to growth at the end of last year. But the economy is certainly falling again so far in the first three months of 2021, due to the tough national lockdowns, as well as some impact from increased trade barriers with the European Union. The chancellor and Bank of England will be paying much more attention to what is going on right now. The renewed lockdown has hit growth considerably again, but not as hard as last April. Businesses and households remain in holding pattern ready to unleash pent up growth when the economy is reopened. While the vaccine will eventually unlock that growth, the precise timing is still uncertain, and the government remains under pressure to maintain significant sums in economic support. Last year's contraction is steeper than almost any other big economy, although Spain suffered an 11% decline. Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head of population. Much of the damage to the UK economy is attributed by economists to a high dependence on the service sector, which suffered particularly badly during the year because of lockdown. However, Britain has vaccinated many more people than other European countries so far, raising the prospect of a bounce-back for its economy later this year. That potential fast rebound prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to describe the economy as like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"". Andy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring. Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""There are reasons for cautious optimism, because the vaccine roll-out is going really well. ""The prime minister will set out a roadmap for exiting restrictions in the next few weeks and months. It will be the week of February, 22nd, and it's related that we base our roadmap on the best possible evidence of data."" Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries? How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"The European Commission's Maros Sefcovic arrives in London to meet the UK's Michael Gove The UK and the EU have had a ""frank but constructive discussion"" on problems implementing post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove met the vice-president of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, in London on Thursday evening. Both sides reiterated their ""full commitment"" to the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. But they pledged to meet again to ""address all outstanding issues"". Mr Gove had previously called for an urgent ""reset"" on the arrangements, which see checks taking place between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - calling for a two-year ""grace period"" on the rules. But the Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, said any pause in enforcement could only be a matter of months,telling the BBC: ""It can't be a year."" Writing to Mr Gove ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic said the existing protocol was ""the only way"" to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster - who wants the protocol scrapped - said ""more rigorous implementation"" was ""not going to work"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Martin calls on 'big beasts' of EU to 'cool it' The Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border remained on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But to make it work, the two sides agreed that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK. This meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. Checks at some ports weretemporarily suspended at the beginning of Februaryover ""sinister"" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods. Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. DUP leader Mrs Foster accused Mr Sefcovic ofhaving his ""head in the sand"" over the issues, and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""step up"" to sort out the issues. But the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day. In a joint statement after their meeting, Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic reiterated their ""full commitment"" to the Good Friday Agreement and to the ""proper implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. They said this was necessary to ensure stability, prevent a hard border and ""impact as little as possible on the everyday life"" of people living on the island of Ireland. The statement also said they had ""taken in to account"" the views expressed by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. It is understood Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic will hold a virtual meeting with Northern Ireland business leaders next week, before further discussions on 24 February. Irish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, described the meeting as ""a good day's work"". In a tweet, he said the ""focus now"" was on ""cooperation to implement what's been agreed in the protocol... and to work on solutions to outstanding issues"". Sinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the two sides' commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and implementation of the protocol ""protecting the gains of peace, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the BBC that the language of the statement was ""more constructive"", but Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the protocol was ""breaking"" Northern Ireland's links with Great Britain, which ""shouldn't be allowed to happen"".

"US President Joe Biden has spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping US President Joe Biden has warned that China will âeat our lunchâ if America doesnât âstep upâ its infrastructure spending. Mr Biden was speaking on Thursday with a group of senators about the need to upgrade infrastructure in the US. His warning comes the day after his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. On the call, Mr Xi took a hard line on human rights saying a confrontation would be a disaster for both countries. The people Joe Biden hopes can fix the US economy Trump scales back landmark environmental law Why US-China relations have reached a low Mr Biden made the comments after meeting with members of the Environment and Public Works committee. âIf we donât get moving, they are going to eat our lunch,â President Biden told senators. âTheyâre investing billions of dollars dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things.

President Biden also discussed several other points of friction with the Chinese President during his call. The White House said he voiced âfundamentalâ concerns about Beijingâs âcoercive and unfairâ trade practices, as well as concerns over Chinaâs crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. He also raised Chinaâs increasingly assertive posture toward Taiwan and the countryâs lack of transparency over Covid-19, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

"The violent riot at the US Capitol on 6 January saw five people lose their lives Democrats have finished their arguments that Donald Trump incited the attack on the US Congress, warning ""he can do this again"" if he is not convicted. Impeachment prosecutors used rioters' own words to link Mr Trump to the violence while arguing last month's riot had caused long-term harm as well. Democrats also presented accounts from police, staff, intelligence officials and foreign media to pursue their case. The former president's defence team will present their arguments on Friday. Did Trump's words at rally incite violence? Trump lawyer offers bewildering defence statement 'They thought they were going to die' The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Mr Trump last month, accusing him of inciting the riot on the Capitol building on 6 January. Lawmakers from the House have been presenting their case to senators at his trial this week. Mr Trump's lawyers have argued he was using his right to freedom of speech when declaring last November's presidential election fraudulent. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, former President Trump is accused of having incited insurrection What has already happened?The House of Representatives voted to impeach Mr Trump for a second time on 13 January, a week before the end of his term. The Senate is now holding a trial So what does it mean?As he is no longer president senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again - but only if he is convicted A two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate, but an acquittal looks likely as the vast majority of Republican senators have remained loyal to him so far. If Mr Trump is convicted, however, the Senate could also vote to bar him from holding elected office again. The violent riot at the Capitol, which saw five people lose their lives, was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified. This video can not be played The prosecution's closing argument: ""We humbly ask you to convict President Trump"" On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Mr Trump is accused of inciting. Democrats sought to detail how Mr Trump sparked the attack on the Capitol and presented evidence that took senators step-by-step through the events of the day of the riot. On Thursday, they embarked on the final point of their prosecution: the harm they say Mr Trump caused to property, people and democracy. ""Because impeachment, conviction and disqualification [from office] is not just about the past. It's about the future,"" Congressman Ted Lieu told the trial, after arguing Mr Trump had shown no remorse for his actions. ""It's making sure that no future official, no future president does the same exact thing."" Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Police describe a 'medieval battle' House prosecutor Joe Neguse made the case that Mr Trump was ""not just some guy"" making a controversial speech - he was a president addressing supporters who were ""poised for violence [and] he struck a match"".

Fellow House manager David Cicilline used video and court documents to illustrate the harm done to ""Congress and the Democratic process"". He added that some rioters admitted they planned to murder Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while others spoke of ""sealing"" lawmakers in the basement where they hid and ""turning on the gas"". ""Never did any of us imagine that we would face mortal peril by a mob riled up by the president of the United States,"" Mr Cicilline said. He also shared accounts from frightened staff who were in the Capitol during the riot. The Democratic impeachment managers have now concluded their case Democrats also argued Mr Trump's conduct caused ""long-term harm"" to both domestic security and the nation's international standing. Impeachment manager Diana DeGette argued threats from domestic extremist groups ""were and are made worse by President Trump's refusal to take accountability and his refusal to forcibly denounce what his own FBI identified as some of the most dangerous elements of our country"". Congressman Joaquin Castro said international allies were shocked by the attack while adversaries mocked the US. ""The world is watching and wondering whether we are who we say we are."" Lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin concluded by outlining questions for Donald Trump's defence team, as Mr Trump himself has refused to testify: Why did President Trump not tell his supporters to stop the attack on the Capitol as soon as he learned of it? Why did President Trump do nothing to stop the attack for at least two hours after the attack began? Why did he do nothing to send help to overwhelmed and besieged law enforcement officers for at least two hours after the attack begin? On 6 January, why did President Trump at any point that day do nothing to condemn the violent insurrection and insurrectionists? Mr Trump's Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the next two days to set out their defence. Fact-checking Trump's defence case Earlier on Thursday, Mr Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio footage they showed the Senate. A number of Republican senators have said they will vote for Mr Trump as they do not believe the constitution allows for the impeachment of a former president, despite the Senate rejecting that argument in a vote on Tuesday. Donald Trump's defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although they are already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like they are winning on numbers and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, they are probably right. Senators will then have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they do not, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Mr Trump's fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest - less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Mr Trump's last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnson's proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible - and it looks like they will get their wish. Read more from Anthony How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world.

"England's rules on quarantine hotels for travellers arriving from Covid ""red list"" countries are less stringent than those enforced in Australia. The BBC has seen a copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operatorsahead of the policy starting on Monday.,external It spells out the rules for handling travellers for 11 nights of quarantine. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". And it promised to update guidance for hotels ""imminently"". UK's hotel quarantine site taken down after launch 'Luck of the draw': What it's like in hotel quarantine What are the new rules for travel? Australia's system, introduced early last year, is seen as among the best internationally. But as a result of repeated outbreaks among staff and guests, and the arrival of new variants, the rules in Australia have been tightened and are under review again. It comes as the Australian state of Victoriaenters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdownin a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. UK Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the system being introduced was ""very strong"" and its ""standards are amongst the strongest in the world"". ""We keep these measures under review,"" she added. In Australia, people staying in quarantine hotels are not allowed to leave their rooms. This follows incidents in the early months of the pandemic when security guards and hotel guests were seen to mingle, and were blamed for spreading the virus. One of these outbreaks led to a surge in cases that forced Melbourne into a five-month lockdown. A hotel quarantine worker tested positive for coronavirus in Melbourne recently However the authorities in England have issued a conflicting array of messages about policy on this, with No 10 and the Department of Health and Social Care forced to issue several clarifications. The upshot is that travellers will be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. In New Zealand, smoking breaks are allowed, under escort, but with strict guidance not to get close to anyone else. Policy on this changed in Australia after the risks of meal service became apparent. A woman from Singapore who tested negative during most of her stay became infected with the same variant of coronavirus found in a family of five from Nigeria in the room opposite. There's no definitive explanation for how she caught the virus but one suggestion is that the doors of both rooms were opened at the same time to collect meals. Can I book a holiday in the UK? Lessons from Australia's hotel quarantine system Melbourne's hard-won success after a marathon lockdown Officials say the viral load in the air in the family's room - with all five of them being infected - could have meant that the virus was carried through the air across the corridor. It's one reason why hotel staff now deliver meals at staggered times to avoid everyone opening their doors at the same time. The UK guidance states that room service will be ""undertaken in full compliance of Covid-19 prevention best practice"". The government said meals would be served three times per day, but did not comment on specific timings. There is growing evidence of the risks of the virus being transmitted through the air either between rooms or between rooms and public areas such as corridors. A security guard who spent the day on duty in a corridor caught the virus despite having no contact with anyone. This video can not be played See inside a five-star quarantine hotel A widely-held assumption is that infectious aerosols had accumulated in the air in this poorly-ventilated space and had led to his infection. In the state of Victoria, hotel staff now have to be equipped with a type of mask known as an N95, roughly equivalent to what is called an FFP2 in the UK. By contrast, the document issued to UK hotels spells out that standard surgical masks must be worn - these are thinner and are thought to be less effective at blocking aerosols. Which masks offer the most protection? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors How can you keep yourself and your family safe? It also says that if emergency maintenance is needed before a room has been disinfected and left vacant for 72 hours, staff should wear PPE that is ""consistent with droplet precautions"". Droplets are produced by coughs and heavy exhalations and are generally judged to be a risk over a distance of up to two metres. There is no specific guidance on the protection needed to guard against aerosols that can linger in the air. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, is among scientists pushing for hotel staff to be better equipped. ""I truly believe that if you're putting workers in harm's way, which essentially you are, by putting them in a quarantine hotel, and exposing them to people potentially with Covid-19, that there's a duty of care that those people have the highest possible protection from infection."" Following infections among hotel staff in Australia, and amid fears of the new variants, all employees are tested for coronavirus every day. That includes days off, with a requirement that staff are paid for those days. However, the UK document does not suggest any provision for regular testing. England's Department of Health said plans for a ""bespoke service"" for staff testing were being developed but it could not confirm whether it would be ready for the start of the policy on Monday. The government added that all staff working in England's quarantine hotels would be provided with regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. A government spokesperson said: ""We have taken decisive action at the border and every essential check from pre-departure testing, to the passenger locator form and the suspension of travel routes strengthens our borders and prevents the spread coronavirus into the UK."" Ministers have said they have ""shared expertise"" with the Australian government about quarantine, but questions will be raised about whether the lessons learned are being followed. 39 WAYS TO SAVE THE PLANET:Tom Heap offers up fresh and fascinating ideas to cut carbon ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL?:Learn new things with Greg James and Bella Mackie from Britain's most inspiring teachers Hotel quarantine site taken down after launch Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is fighting extradition from Canada to the US The Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is taking the bank HSBC to court in the UK as part of its attempt to prevent the extradition of its chief financial officer from Canada to the US. Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a US request over claims she misled HSBC in a 2013 meeting. Huawei now hopes to gain access to HSBC documents that could help it undermine the US case for her extradition. The bank told the BBC the application for disclosure was ""without merit"". The move comes amid political pressure on HSBC, which is UK based but was founded in Hong Kong where it makes much of its profits. The court hearing in London on Friday draws the bank deeper into a legal battle which has raised tensions between Canada and China. Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested at Vancouver airport on 1 December 2018 because the US wants her to stand trial on charges including fraud. These are linked to the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran, allegations she denies. A meeting between Ms Meng and HSBC on 22 August 2013 is central to the claims. Huawei patent mentions use of Uighur-spotting tech What is Huawei and why is it being banned? Reuters news reports in the preceding months had raised questions about whether there had been a breach of trade sanctions on Iran by Hong Kong-based firm Skycom. At issue was whether Skycom, a telecoms equipment seller, was simply a business partner of Huawei's - or a front for it to conceal its activities in Iran. The US alleges that in the meeting Ms Meng misled HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran.  But it was more than five years after the meeting that she was detained. Her Canadian lawyers have followed a multi-pronged strategy to try to prevent the extradition. One part has involved claiming the US omitted key information on two slides which showed HSBC was not, in fact, being kept in the dark about the true nature of the Skycom/Huawei relationship and she was clear about it. Now, her lawyers have made an application to the UK high court under the Bankers Book Evidence Act to access relevant information kept in HSBC's books. Under this Act, they are seeking a court order to gain access to HSBC documentation. They are understood to be seeking evidence about what HSBC did or did not know about Huawei and Skycom's relationship in Iran and how high up the bank knowledge of the meeting went. In response, a spokesperson for HSBC said: ""This application for disclosure in the UK is without merit. HSBC is not a party to the underlying criminal case in the US or the extradition proceeding in Canada. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing legal matter."" The case has placed HSBC in a difficult position. In China there has been criticism for it having handed over information to US authorities which led to Ms Meng's arrest. The bank has always maintained it simply handed over what it was required to under law. It has also come under fire in the UK from those who believe it has been too friendly with Beijing, pointing to the freezing of the bank accounts of a Hong Kong activist which led to the questioning of company executives by a parliamentary committee recently.

"Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is fighting extradition from Canada to the US The Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is taking the bank HSBC to court in the UK as part of its attempt to prevent the extradition of its chief financial officer from Canada to the US. Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a US request over claims she misled HSBC in a 2013 meeting. Huawei now hopes to gain access to HSBC documents that could help it undermine the US case for her extradition. The bank told the BBC the application for disclosure was ""without merit"". The move comes amid political pressure on HSBC, which is UK based but was founded in Hong Kong where it makes much of its profits. The court hearing in London on Friday draws the bank deeper into a legal battle which has raised tensions between Canada and China. Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested at Vancouver airport on 1 December 2018 because the US wants her to stand trial on charges including fraud. These are linked to the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran, allegations she denies. A meeting between Ms Meng and HSBC on 22 August 2013 is central to the claims. Huawei patent mentions use of Uighur-spotting tech What is Huawei and why is it being banned? Reuters news reports in the preceding months had raised questions about whether there had been a breach of trade sanctions on Iran by Hong Kong-based firm Skycom. At issue was whether Skycom, a telecoms equipment seller, was simply a business partner of Huawei's - or a front for it to conceal its activities in Iran. The US alleges that in the meeting Ms Meng misled HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran.  But it was more than five years after the meeting that she was detained. Her Canadian lawyers have followed a multi-pronged strategy to try to prevent the extradition. One part has involved claiming the US omitted key information on two slides which showed HSBC was not, in fact, being kept in the dark about the true nature of the Skycom/Huawei relationship and she was clear about it. Now, her lawyers have made an application to the UK high court under the Bankers Book Evidence Act to access relevant information kept in HSBC's books. Under this Act, they are seeking a court order to gain access to HSBC documentation. They are understood to be seeking evidence about what HSBC did or did not know about Huawei and Skycom's relationship in Iran and how high up the bank knowledge of the meeting went. In response, a spokesperson for HSBC said: ""This application for disclosure in the UK is without merit. HSBC is not a party to the underlying criminal case in the US or the extradition proceeding in Canada. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing legal matter."" The case has placed HSBC in a difficult position. In China there has been criticism for it having handed over information to US authorities which led to Ms Meng's arrest. The bank has always maintained it simply handed over what it was required to under law. It has also come under fire in the UK from those who believe it has been too friendly with Beijing, pointing to the freezing of the bank accounts of a Hong Kong activist which led to the questioning of company executives by a parliamentary committee recently. Ms Meng is expected to appear in court in Canada on 1 March for the latest stage of her extradition hearings, which are scheduled to finish in May, although appeals are likely to extend the process.

"US President Joe Biden has spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping US President Joe Biden has warned that China will âeat our lunchâ if America doesnât âstep upâ its infrastructure spending. Mr Biden was speaking on Thursday with a group of senators about the need to upgrade infrastructure in the US. His warning comes the day after his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. On the call, Mr Xi took a hard line on human rights saying a confrontation would be a disaster for both countries. The people Joe Biden hopes can fix the US economy Trump scales back landmark environmental law Why US-China relations have reached a low Mr Biden made the comments after meeting with members of the Environment and Public Works committee. âIf we donât get moving, they are going to eat our lunch,â President Biden told senators. âTheyâre investing billions of dollars dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things. We just have to step up.â During the campaign, Mr Biden proposed spending $2tn (Â£1.45tn) over four years to create jobs and invest in clean energy infrastructure. A widely cited American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) âreport cardâ from 2017 gave the countryâs infrastructure a grade of âD+â. The ASCE estimated that the total âinfrastructure gapâ needed $2tn by 2025 to fix, but would cost the economy twice as much if it went unaddressed. The World Economic Forumâs 2019 Global Competitiveness Report ranked the US 13th in a broad measure of infrastructure quality, down from fifth place in 2002. This video can not be played Expect 'extreme competition' between US and China China has been investing heavily in its infrastructure, pouring money into high-speed rail, metro systems, apartment buildings, electricity grids and mobile networks. âThey have a major, major new initiative on rail and they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease,â Mr Biden noted. President Biden also discussed several other points of friction with the Chinese President during his call. The White House said he voiced âfundamentalâ concerns about Beijingâs âcoercive and unfairâ trade practices, as well as concerns over Chinaâs crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. He also raised Chinaâs increasingly assertive posture toward Taiwan and the countryâs lack of transparency over Covid-19, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Mr Xi maintained a hard line on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, calling them matters of âsovereignty and territorial integrityâ. He told Mr Biden confrontation would be a âdisasterâ and the two sides should re-establish the means to avoid misjudgements, Chinaâs foreign ministry said.

"This video can not be played Prof Pearson said the remains of a cow, which was found at the site, suggested animals may have helped to pull the stones to their resting spot in England One of Britain's biggest and oldest stone circles has been found in Wales - and could be the original building blocks of Stonehenge. Archaeologists uncovered the remains of the Waun Mawn site in Pembrokeshire's Preseli Hills. They believe the stones could have been dismantled and rebuilt 150 miles (240 km) away on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire. The discovery was made during filming for BBC Two's Stonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed. The Welsh circle, believed to be the third biggest in Britain, has a diameter of 360ft (110m), the same as the ditch that encloses Stonehenge, and both are aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise. Solved: Mystery of where Stonehenge's stones come from Stonehenge: First residents from west Wales Patrols aim to tackle heritage crime in Wales Several of the monoliths at the World Heritage Site are of the same rock type as those that still remain at the Welsh site. And one of the bluestones at Stonehenge has an unusual cross-section which matches one of the holes left at Waun Mawn, suggesting the monolith began its life as part of the stone circle in the Preseli Hills before being moved. Archaeologists unearthed the ancient stone circle at Waun Mawn in the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire Multiple large ""stone holes"" were found at Waun Mawn It is already known that thesmaller bluestones that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire. But the new discovery suggests the bluestones from Waun Mawn could have been moved as the ancient people of the Preseli region migrated, even taking their monuments with them, as a sign of their ancestral identity. They would then have been re-erected at Stonehenge. Archaeologists said this could explain why the bluestones, thought to be the first monoliths erected at Stonehenge, were brought from so far away, while most circles are constructed within a short distance of their quarries. The team was working in bad weather in the Preseli Hills when the circle was discovered The archaeological investigations as part of the Stones of Stonehenge research project, led by Professor Mike Parker Pearson of University College London, previously excavated two bluestone quarries in the Preseli Hills. Their discovery that the bluestones had been extracted before the first stage of Stonehenge was built in 3000 BC prompted the team to re-investigate the nearby Waun Mawn stones to see if it was the site of a stone circle supplied by the quarry and later moved. Only four monoliths remain at the site, but an archaeological dig in 2018 revealed holes where stones would have stood, showing the remaining stones were part of a wider circle of 30-50 stones. And the scientific dating of charcoal and sediment from the holes reveal it was put up around 3400 BC.

It also confirms that the region was an important and densely settled area in Neolithic times until 3000 BC when activity seems to have ceased. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""It's as if they just vanished. Maybe most of the people migrated, taking their stones - their ancestral identities - with them."" Analysis of the remains of people buried at Stonehenge at the time the bluestones were erected there would seem to back up the theory, as it shows some of them were from western Britain, possibly Wales. With only a few of the Stonehenge stones directly linked to Waun Mawn, the archaeologists also believe monoliths from other stone circles could have been taken from Wales to form part of the new monument. Prof Parker Pearson said: ""With an estimated 80 bluestones put up on Salisbury Plain at Stonehenge and nearby Bluestonehenge, my guess is that Waun Mawn was not the only stone circle that contributed to Stonehenge. ""Maybe there are more in Preseli waiting to be found. Who knows? Someone will be lucky enough to find them.""

"Sawfish fins and teeth are sold as trophies, food and medicine They are the most extraordinary of fish, resembling ""hedge trimmers with fins"". The sawfish, which is a kind of ray, is also among the most endangered of the fish living in the oceans. Once found along the coastlines of 90 countries, the animals are now presumed extinct in more than half of these, according to a new study. They are vanishing due to habitat loss and entanglement in fishing nets, experts have said. Their ""saws"", which evolved to sense and attack prey, have now become a liability, making them prone to being caught up in fishing gear. ""Through the plight of sawfish, we are documenting the first cases of a wide-ranging marine fish being driven to local extinction by overfishing,"" said Prof Nick Dulvy of Simon Fraser University (SFU) in British Columbia, Canada. 'Time is running out' to save sharks and rays ''Extinction risk' to sharks and rays Sawfish snout senses and swipes Of the five species of sawfish, three are critically endangered, while two are listed as endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Some species reach lengths of about 7m (23 ft) Previously widespread, the sawfish are now presumed extinct in 55 nations, the study said. There are 18 countries where at least one species of sawfish is missing, and 28 more where two species have disappeared. The list of countries where sawfish are extinct now includes China, Iraq, Haiti, Japan, Timor-Leste, El Salvador, Taiwan, Djibouti and Brunei. The US and Australia appear to be the last strongholds for the species, regarded as ""lifeboat nations,"" where sawfish are better protected. The study, published in Science Advances, also identified eight nations where urgent action could make a big contribution to saving the species through conservation efforts. These are Cuba, Tanzania, Colombia, Madagascar, Panama, Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka. Their teeth are easily caught in fishing nets ""While the situation is dire, we hope to offset the bad news by highlighting our informed identification of these priority nations with hope for saving sawfish in their waters,"" said Helen Yan of SFU. She said it is still possible to restore sawfish to more than 70% of their historical range, ""if we act now"". International trade in sawfish is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, but targeted and accidental killings still occur. Sawfish fins and teeth are sold as trophies, food or medicine, and as spurs for cockfighting. Sonja Fordham, a researcher of the study and president of Shark Advocates International, said there were opportunities to ""bring these extraordinary animals back from the brink"". But she warned that in too many places, ""we're running out of time to save them"". Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them.Â In a letter to editors of all the Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express titles and websites, a representative said the pair had taken the step due to ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. Harry and Meghan said they refused to ""offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion"". The couple have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Royal Family tree and line of succession How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life In the letter, the couple's public relations representative wrote it was ""gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media"" has printed ""distorted, false or invasive"" articles. ""There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society,"" the letter said. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue."" The BBC was told that the letter had been sent to the editors of the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express newspapers. The new policy will apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and associated websites,the Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson reported,external. The Daily Star, which was not specifically mentioned, is published by the same group that publishes the Mirror and Express titles. The ban on engagement with the papers will mean that the couple's PR team will no longer even answer calls from the papers asking them to confirm whether claims made about the couple are true or not. Outlining the new policy of ""no corroboration and zero engagement"" with all the publications that received it, the letter said the measure would also protect the couple's communications team ""from the side of the industry that readers never see"". ""This policy is not about avoiding criticism,"" the letter continued. ""It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie."" Prince Harry has spoken in the past of seeing - as a young child - the effect media intrusion had on his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales The letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and ""young, up-and-coming journalists"" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about. Why the Royal Family rarely go to court Meghan's father 'would testify in privacy case' Meghan sues Mail on Sunday over private letter In recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter. And it comes ahead of a court hearing this week ina legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sundayover the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father. The couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition followingan announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January.. As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation. Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracyâ particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account. It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or printâeven when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they knowâas well as complete strangersâhave their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue. With that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever. What they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.

"Democrats have concluded their case that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot The prosecutors used rioters' own words to tie the former president to violence at the Capitol On Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Trump is accused of inciting The deadly riot at the US Capitol was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified Trump's lawyers have argued he has freedom of speech to declare the election fraudulent Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Edited by Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of the impeachment trial. We're done for now, but we'll be back tomorrow at11:30 EST/16:30 GMTas the defence team begins their arguments. In the meantime, you can follow updates to the story here. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's
 editors and writers were: Marianna Brady, 
Tom Spender, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich and Penny Spiller. The trial may be heading into the weekend, but we'll still be here breaking it all down for you. But until proceedings pick back up again tomorrow, here's a selection of our best explainers and features to check out: For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal vice-president to Donald Trump. He smoothed the rough edges of the Trump presidency, and Trump's supporters loved him for it. But on 6 January, the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol branded him a traitor, even chanting ""hang Mike Pence"". So what changed? This video can not be played How Mike Pence became a villain in Trump world There is at least one more full day left in the Senate trial, but the final outcome is all but set. Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds. Republican senators are still insisting that the trial remains unconstitutional, since Trump is now a private citizen, and is therefore a waste of time. Here is what some Republicans are saying today: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,
ina document supporting her detention and published by CNN,external, she had ""trained and plotted for a
moment like this"". The document also
referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her
concern about taking action without Trumpâs backing: ""The [president] has the right
to activate units too. If Trump asks me to come, I will. Otherwise, I canât
trust it."" Jessica Watkins is a former army veteran Democratic prosecutors of Trump's second impeachment trial accused him of inciting the 6 January riots on Capitol Hill with a barrage of incendiary speeches and tweets following his election loss. The former president's lawyers will argue on Friday that he was exercising freedom of speech by calling the election a fraud, and never directly told his supporters to enter the Capitol building. Read more about the Oath Keepers and other US militia groups here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The House impeachment managers have finished presenting their case over the course of about 13 hours. Donald Trumpâs defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although theyâre already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening. They feel like theyâre winning â and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, theyâre probably right. After Trumpâs side finishes, senators will have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams. That will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they donât, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Trumpâs fate. All told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest â less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said.

Despite some acknowledgement from Republicans that Democratic impeachment managers have made powerful arguments, there's no indication it has changed any minds.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In their brief, Trumpâs lawyers used a time-honoured defence: their client, they argued, was âmisunderstoodâ. They also spelled United States wrong calling it the âUnites Statesâ, another sign of a hastily-put together document. They are planning to wrap up their argument in one day, a surprisingly short time, given the enormity of the charge - and one less day than they were allotted. The Democrats have built a detailed case against the former president over two days, with their arguments supported by chilling video of the violent assault on the Capitol. In contrast, when we heard from the defence earlier this week one lawyer, Bruce Castor, rambled, and even seemed confused. Trump was reportedly furious. You canread more about the scathing reviews here. Later, Castor insisted on Fox News that his client did in fact approve of their work, despite what people were saying. It was hardly a strong message - but heâll have a second chance to impress on Friday. We've heard a lot of people speak about Donald Trump over the past few days, but the man himself has been out of sight. Banned from Twitter, Trump has not shared his thoughts about the trial or much of anything else in his post-presidency. Here's what we do know. The former president now lives in Florida and on Tuesday he received some good news whenthe Palm Beach city council voted to allow his permanent residency at his club, Mar-a-Lago. Earlier today, according to CNN, he was spotted by one of their network's photographer playing a round of golf at his West Palm Beach course. He has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment trial in Washington DC, with his lawyers slamming it as ""a publicity stunt"". Their defence starts tomorrow, but Trump will not be present. It remains unclear how much of the trial he is watching. Jessica Watkins (centre) is facing trial for conspiracy over the 6 January riot An alleged leader
of a paramilitary group that stormed the Capitol spoke of waiting for direction
from President Trump, prosecutors have said in a court filing. Jessica Watkins was
among a number of so-called Oath Keepers who changed into military dress and
walked on the Capitol after listening to Donald Trumpâs speech on 6 January. She was later seen
on a self-shot video in the Capitol building, and heard saying via walkie-talkie: ""We have a good groupâ¦ Sticking together and sticking to the plan."" The 38-year-old army veteran from Ohio has been charged with conspiracy. Prosecutors said,

referenced a message she wrote after the November election expressing her

That stands in stark contrast to Trumpâs last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnsonâs proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months. Most of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible â and it looks like theyâll get their wish. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, US Capitol Democrats argued today that one of the reasons Donald Trump should be impeached is because he has damaged Americaâs standing in the international community. They said insurrectionists incited by Trump showed how easy it was to penetrate an American government building and foreign adversaries were probably taking notes. They argued that his actions gave authoritarian governments ammunition to defend their policies. China, for example, could more easily condemn democracy activists in Hong Kong as insurrectionists, said Congressman Joaquin Castro on the Senate floor, and Iran is mocking us. The world is watching to see whether rule of law prevails over rule of the mob in the United States â thatâs what weâre showing the world if we convict Donald Trump, he argued. How did you react to the new footage of the Capitol riot shown yesterday? Did it change your mind about whether Trump should be convicted or not? I'm catching the highlights of the trial. Trump should absolutely not be convicted. I'm not somebody who's just blinding myself to the facts. He didn't ask people to do anything violent. People showed up in advance planning violent acts, like the one person who planted some explosive devices the night before. Trump had nothing to do with that. There are obviously some bad elements that showed up intent on a violent protest long before Trump even spoke that day. I think Trump is a pretty smart guy who knows the effect his words have and I don't think he wanted the actual outcome of 6 January. David Schoen, left, and Bruce Castor, right, are leading the defence of former president Trump The next time we're back in the Senate chamber, we'll be hearing from Donald Trump's defence team. So who are they? Trump has two lawyers defending him during this trial:David Schoen, a trial lawyer from Alabama, andBruce Castor, a former district attorney. Schoen has previously represented Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser (who you may recall received a presidential pardon in December). Schoen also made headlines in the past  for meeting with Jeffrey 
Epstein in his final days to discuss possible representation, and for 
later saying he did not believe the death of the US financier and sex 
offender was suicide. Castor, a former Pennsylvania district attorney, is known for declining
 to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 - though Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial. Read more about the key players in this impeachment trial here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been criticised for his demeanor during the impeachment trial: at one point, he sat with his feet up on a chair and watched the proceedings. Earlier, he was attacked for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Editorial writers at a Missouri newspaper have ripped into him for his actions, saying that he is an ""embarrassment"" to the state. He has alienated these editorial writers, and some ordinary voters too. Hawley's approval rating in the state dropped six points last month, according to a Morning Consult poll, from 42% to 36%. He seems unfazed, though, and has continued to hammer away at Democrats. On Thursday, Hawley told Fox News that the impeachment was a ""kangaroo trial"". He is likely to ramp up his arguments against the Democrats, as well as his aggressive language, if he decides to run for president in 2024, as many have predicted. Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill Senators have to be silent on the Senate floor, and though they havenât been very chatty outside, they are talking to the press. Most Republicans believe that there is no correlation between Trumpâs words and the actions of the insurrectionists. ""Today was not connecting the dots,â said Senator James Lanford. And Senator Jim Inhofe added: ""The more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it."" Senator Ted Cruz had some fiery words about the trial so far. ""If words like fight and win and take back our country now satisfy the legal standard for incitement, then every political candidate in the country...is about to be prosecuted."" Lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen will set out Trump's case Now that Democratic prosecutors have finished setting out
their case, itâs time for Donald Trumpâs lawyers to have their say. Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the
next two days to set out their defence, although they are not expected to use
all that time. On the opening day of the trial, they argued that Trump was
exercising his right to free speech, both in tweets and when he took to the
stage in front of supporters on 6 January. We are likely to hear more of this
line of argument from them. Earlier today, Schoen accused the Democrats of making ""movies"" and
presenting the case as an ""entertainment package"" with the video and audio
footage they showed the Senate. After Trumpâs team concludes their case, the Senate will have
up to four hours to ask written questions of both sides. Witnesses could also
be called but it is not yet clear if that will happen. If there are no witnesses, we could see a vote on conviction this weekend, or by Monday. As he concluded his argument, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin outlined some questions for Donald Trump's defence team. Donald Trump refused the chance to testify for himself, Raskin said, so Democrats pose these questions to his lawyers instead: And lastly, a legal question: Allow Twitter content?

That's a wrap on the opening arguments of the prosecution's case. Over the last three days, the House impeachment managers have argued that Trump incited the deadly siege at the US Capitol on 6 January. Now, the Senate has adjourned until tomorrow - when we'll hear from Trump's defence team. Congressman Jamie Raskin is closing his argument with direct appeals to the president's defence team. His message? A reminder that the question of whether the trial is allowed by law is over. ""We've put that jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed,"" Raskin says. ""This is a trial on the facts of what happened and incitement is a fact-intensive investigation and a judgment each of you will have to make."" Joe Neguse has concluded summing up the evidence the prosecution has shared over the past two days. ""We humbly, humbly, ask you to convict,"" he says. ""Because if you donât... if we pretend this didnât happen, or worse if we let it go unanswered, whoâs to say it wonât happen again."" He turns the podium over to lead manager Jamie Raskin. Joe Neguse, the youngest member of the house impeachment team, is given the important job of recapping the evidence against Trump. A child of refugees from Eritrea, the 36-year-old is the first African-American congressman from the state of Colorado. He started making waves on social media yesterday when he presented a good portion of the evidence against the ex-president. Here's what people on Twitter are saying about him. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans in Congress are ""so tired"" after years of being led by Donald Trump that many just want to put this episode behind them, a former senior Republican Senate staff member says. Antonia Ferrier told the BBC's Ros Atkins that there were a variety of reasons why Republicans are unlikely to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment even though the Democrats have put together a ""very compelling"" case against him. ""There are some who think that continuing down this path ... just keeps emotions enflamed. They would rather take the temperature down and get back to work,"" she said. ""Many of them just want this chapter to be over, after four years of Donald Trump, they are just tired of the man."" You can watch more of Ms Ferrier's interview here: Allow Twitter content?
