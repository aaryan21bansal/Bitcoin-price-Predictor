"The government'sWithdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB),external, which will take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, has passed all its stages in Parliament and been given Royal Assent. The WAB turns Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement, which is a draft international treaty, into UK law and gives the government permission to ratify it. No new clauses or amendments were passed by MPs, who also rejected changes made in the House of Lords. What does the WAB actually cover? Among other things: It sets out exactly how the UK will make ""divorce bill"" payments to the EU for years to come It repeals the European Communities Act, which took the UK into the EU, but then reinstates it immediately until the end of 2020 when the transition period ends It contains language on how the new protocol on Ireland - setting up what amounts to a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - will work in practice It sets out areas in which the European Court of Justice still plays a role in the UK, and makes the withdrawal agreement in some respects ""supreme"" over other areas of UK law One of those areas may be in the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement. The bill introduces a duty for the government to report on this It prohibits any extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020, even if a free trade deal isn't ready in time In the section on citizens' rights it sets up an independent monitoring authority (IMA) with which EU nationals in the UK can lodge any complaints about the way the government treats them In several policy areas, particularly in Northern Ireland, the bill gives ministers a lot of power to change the law (through secondary legislation) without MPs getting to vote It introduces a duty for the government to report on its use of the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement A number of clauses in the previous version of the bill have been removed. They include: The possibility of an extension to the transition period and the procedures around that. The bill now prohibits ministers asking for an extension. Workers' rights protections - the government says these will now be part of a separate bill. Checks and balances that MPs were offered as an inducement to pass the old bill in October. For example, the requirement for the government's negotiating position on the future relationship with the EU to be approved by Parliament has gone. And the government's position no longer needs to be in line with the political declaration - the non-legally binding document that accompanied the withdrawal agreement and sets out aspirations for the future relationship. A clause on child refugees. The bill removes the requirement,introduced by Lord Dubs,to agree a deal that if an unaccompanied child claims international protection in the EU, they may come to the UK if they have relatives living in the country. The new bill only requires a government minister to make a statement setting out policy on the subject within two months. Between 2016 and 2018, 426 unaccompanied children came to the UKin this way,external. After the WAB becomes law, the withdrawal agreement also needs to be ratified by the European Parliament. What is the transition period? What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Then the stage will be set for Brexit on 31 January, when the post-Brexit transition period will begin. For 11 months, the UK will still follow all the EU's rules and regulations, it will remain in the single market and the customs union, and the free movement of people will continue. The challenge for the government will be to get all its new rules and policies in place by the end of this year. This article was originally published on 21 October and has been updated to reflect changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and its passage towards becoming law.

"A US drug company says it has created the first therapy that could slow Alzheimer's disease, and it is now ready to bring it to market. Currently, there are no drugs that can do this - existing ones only help with symptoms. Biogen,externalsays it will soon seek regulatory approval in the US for the ""groundbreaking"" drug, called aducanumab. It plans to file the paperwork in early 2020 and has its sights on Europe too. Approval processes could take a year or two. If successful, the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled in clinical studies of the drug. The announcement is somewhat surprising because the company had discontinued work on the drug in March 2019, after disappointing trial results. But the company says a new analysis of a larger dataset of the same studies shows that higher doses of aducanumab can provide a significant benefit to patients with early Alzheimer's, slowing their clinical decline so they preserve more of their memory and every day living skills - things that the disease usually robs. Aducanumab targets a protein called amyloid that forms abnormal deposits the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells and that clearing them using drugs would be a massive advance in dementia treatment, although not a cure. There haven't been any new dementia drugs in over a decade. Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time New type of dementia identified Biogen's chief executive Michel Vounatsos said: ""We are hopeful about the prospect of offering patients the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease."" Hilary Evans from Alzheimer's Research UK said: ""People affected by Alzheimer's have waited a long time for a life-changing new treatment and this exciting announcement offers new hope that one could be in sight. ""Taking another look at aducanumab is a positive step for all those who took part in the clinical trials and the worldwide dementia research community. As more data emerges, we hope it will spark global discussions about the next steps for delivering much-needed treatments into people's hands."" Prof Bart De Strooper, Director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, said: ""It is fantastic to hear of these new positive results emerging from the aducanumab trials. We currently have no effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease and I hope this signifies a turning point."" Dementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking. There are lots of different types of dementia and Alzheimer's is said to be the most common and most researched. There are currently 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. It's been a long and tortuous journey to find new drugs for the disease and recent attempts have ended in failure. Experts hope a treatment is in sight, but they are cautious and will need to closely scrutinise these aducanumab trial findings.

"A firm founded by the youngest entrepreneur to secure investment on the BBC's Dragons' Den is on the brink of insolvency, the BBC has learnt. Gripit Fixings makes a product designed to fix heavy items to plasterboard. Its inventor, Jordan Daykin, was just 18 when he appeared on the programme. However, Mr Daykin left the company this summer and an insolvency practitioner has now been called in. The firm's board told investors it was in ""a precarious position"". Angry shareholders, who stand to lose their entire investment, have been reacting on a forum on the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube, which Gripit has used in the past to raise money. Finance app banks Â£2m from investors Some complained they had been misled about the company's strengths, others that Mr Daykin, who is now 24, had ignored requests for information. One said: ""The company is on its knees and Jordan has left it without any cares. I asked him a polite question on LinkedIn about it this afternoon and he very swiftly blocked me and removed my comment."" The news first emerged in an update to shareholders from the board and management team, seen by the BBC, which was sent out last week. It came after Gripit tried and failed to raise Â£1m in new capital by issuing new shares to existing investors. Gripit said the funding round had been under-subscribed and was therefore being cancelled. Jordan Daykin secured funding from Dragons' Den's Deborah Meaden Mr Daykin patented his product in 2012. He came to prominence when he appeared on Dragons' Den in 2014 and successfully secured an Â£80,000 investment for 25% of his company from one of the show's stars, entrepreneur Deborah Meaden. By 2016, Gripit Fixings were stocked in more than 3,000 UK outlets and exported to 32 countries. Gripit is still listed as an investment onMs Meaden's website,external, where she describes Mr Daykin as someone who ""knows his product and its market inside out"". Ms Meaden confirmed to the BBC that she was still an investor in the company. She added: ""I am pleased that the board and management team have taken quick and responsible action to address the challenges facing the company. ""I will support them in whatever practical way I can as they work towards achieving the best possible outcome for all stakeholders."" Mr Daykin, who left the business four months ago, said it was ""upsetting"" to find the company in such a precarious position. He added: ""Despite the mischaracterisation, during my time as CEO I always took pride in my communications with all investors. Since stepping back, all investor communications have been handled internally."" In January, the company was valued at Â£22.5m and had raised some Â£4m from investors. However, at the time of its last fundraising round in September, it was valued at just Â£6m. Now its investors face the prospect of losing all their money. ""Without a substantial cash injection, the company is not able to continue to trade into the future or deliver on its growth plans,"" said the update from Gripit. ""To this end, the board have secured the advice of an appropriate insolvency practitioner and will examine the company's options in the coming days."" Options included a restructuring plan or a sale of the business. ""Rest assured the management team and board will leave no stone unturned to secure a future for Gripit,"" the statement said, adding that the company would not be in a position to respond to questions for the next two to three weeks. When contacted by the BBC, the firm, registered as UK Building Products Ltd, issued a statement saying Steven Wiseglass, a director at corporate recovery and insolvency practice Inquesta, was providing assistance to it. ""As a result of a number of specific challenges, the company has identified the need to restructure and is examining the options available to it,"" it said. It said the process could take ""a number of months to complete"".

"The thermal imaging camera showed that Ms Gill's breast was a different colour A tourist has told of her ""life-changing"" visit to the Camera Obscura in Edinburgh after one of its thermal cameras detected she had breast cancer. Bal Gill, 41, from Slough in Berkshire, was at the Camera Obscura and World of Illusions at the top of the Royal Mile with her family in May. When she went into the museum's thermal imaging camera room she noticed her left breast was a different colour. When she returned home she saw a doctor who confirmed she had breast cancer. She discovered that thermal imaging cameras can be used as a tool by oncologists. Thermography, also called thermal imaging, uses a special camera to measure the temperature of the skin on the breast's surface. It is a non-invasive test that does not involve any harmful radiation. Cancer cells grow and multiply very fast. Blood flow and metabolism are higher in a cancer tumour as blood flow and metabolism increase, which makes skin temperature rise. The thermal camera was installed at Camera Obscura in 2009 and is a popular attraction Ms Gill, a deputy-director of finance for a university, said: ""We had been to Edinburgh Castle and on the way down we saw the museum. ""While making our way through the floors we got to the thermal imaging camera room. As all families do, we entered and started to wave our arms and look at the images created. ""While doing this I noticed a heat patch coming from my left breast. We thought it was odd and having looked at everyone else they didn't have the same. I took a picture and we carried on and enjoyed the rest of the museum."" A few days later when the mother-of-two returned home she was flicking through her photographs and saw the image. On Google she found a number of articles about breast cancer and thermal imaging cameras. She was later diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. She has since had two surgeries, including a mastectomy, and has a final surgery in November. She has been told she will not need chemotherapy or radiotherapy afterwards. ""I just wanted to say thank you, without that camera I would never have known,"" she said. ""I know it's not the intention of the camera but for me it really was a life-changing visit. ""I cannot tell you enough about how my visit to the Camera Obscura changed my life."" The Thermal Camera is a popular part of the Edinburgh attraction and lets visitors see a visual of all their body hot spots. Andrew Johnson, general manager of Camera Obscura and World of Illusions said: ""We did not realise that our thermal camera had the potential to detect life-changing symptoms in this way. ""We were really moved when Bal contacted us to share her story as breast cancer is very close to home for me and a number of our team. ""It's amazing that Bal noticed the difference in the image and crucially acted on it promptly. We wish her all the best with her recovery and hope to meet her and her family in the future."" Dr Tracey Gillies, NHS Lothian medical director, said: ""In the past thermal imaging cameras have been experimented with to detect cancer, however, this has never been a proven screening tool. ""Early diagnosis of breast cancer improves the ability to treat the cancer and the chance of survival is higher. We encourage any woman that has received an invite to a screening to attend and anyone with concerns who does not qualify for the screening programme to visit their GP.""

"This video can not be played Ex-EastEnders actress describes how she was made to feel during her job-shaming story Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard. On Sunday, theDaily Star,externalrevealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford. It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"". ""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister. ""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible. ""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me."" She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about."" Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019. The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company. She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.

In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment. Tamzin Outhwaite posted,external: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs."" ""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out. ""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore. (L-R) Shane Richie as Alfie Moon, Jessie Wallace as Kat Moon and Katie Jarvis as Hayley Slater holding baby Cherry Slater in 2018 ""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while. ""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story."" Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself. ""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,""he tweeted,external. ""Then I didn't. ""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do."" In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon. Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out. She's no longer on social media. Katie Jarvis: EastEnders actress says she is 'fine' after reported attack Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers. ""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly? ""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general."" (L-R) Sorry We Missed You stars Debbie Honeywood, Katie Proctor, Rhys Stone, Kris Hitchen and Ken Loach at the Cannes Film Festival in May Jarvis is not the first and won't be the last actor to do a ""normal job"" before, during or after an acting career. In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries. Zero-hour contracts can 'kill' - Ken Loach The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs. ""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach. ""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in. ""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie."" He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake."" This video can not be played Director Ken Loach explains why he doesn't use Hollywood actors in his films. Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actorJeremy Edwardsfound work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener. AsCelebs Now reported,external, in 2011, he noted: ""I don't know any actors who work consistently without other work. A lucky few, but not many, I had a good 10-year run!""

"Adnan Ahmed was convicted of five counts of threatening and abusive behaviour towards young women Update: Adnan Ahmed's conviction was quashed on appeal after three judges ruled the verdict was a miscarriage of justice A so-called pick-up artist who targeted ""young and vulnerable"" women has been jailed for two years. Adnan Ahmed -  who called himself Addy A-game - secretly filmed himself approaching dozens of women in Glasgow and Lanarkshire. Ahmed was convicted last month of threatening and abusive behaviour towards five women. The 38-year-old from Maryhill, Glasgow, has also been placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years. Police launched an investigation after his actions were revealed by theBBC's The Socialearlier this year. The Seduction Game How a social media film exposed a pick-up artist The self-styled ""lifestyle coach"" would approach women in the street, often secretly filming the encounter and posting videos offering advice to other men. In the videos, he offered tips on how to overcome ""last-minute resistance"" to sex. One clip included audio of a woman apparently recorded during sex. This video can not be played Adnan Ahmed, also known as Addy A-game, approaches women in the street Five young women, aged between 16 and 21, gave evidence at his trial about how they had been intimidated by Ahmed in Glasgow city centre and in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire. Passing sentence, Sheriff Lindsay Wood said Ahmed - who has been on remand in prison since January - had shown a lack of remorse. He told him:  ""You gave evidence and said that the victims were lying or mistaken, but the jury thought otherwise. ""It was very obvious when they gave evidence how they were affected. ""You have acquired notoriety and an unenviable reputation, the public will be wise to such inappropriate behaviour by you and others like you."" The trial heard how Ahmed approached two schoolgirls in a secluded lane in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, in 2016, when they were aged 16 and 17. He called one of them ""pretty"", tried to get her phone number and made her feel ""uncomfortable"" but she walked away. Adnan Ahmed, appearing here in one of his online videos, claimed they were educational Another woman broke down in court as she described how Ahmed followed her through Glasgow city centre and grabbed her head as he tried to kiss her. The BBC investigation into Ahmed earlier this year revealed a wider pattern of predatory behaviour. Ahmed was part of a global network of ""pick-up artists"" who practise what they call ""game"". YouTube has sinceremoved hundreds of videosand deactivated two channels run by Addy A-Game and another group called Street Attraction following a BBC investigation into the online industry. A social worker who compiled a background report on Ahmed prior to sentencing described his behaviour as ""entrenched."" Defence counsel Donna Armstrong said: ""The accused accepts he was convicted and will change the way he speaks to women."" His two-year sentence was backdated to January when he was first remanded in custody.

"Campaigners in the long-running Skye bridge toll protest are still fighting to have 130 people's criminal convictions repealed more than 15 years after tolls were abolished. In a BBC documentary, David Hingston, the former Dingwall procurator fiscal who prosecuted the first protesters, has said the toll was an ""outrageous"" scam. And if a pivotal piece of evidence produced by the Crown in the court cases was fabricated, Mr Hingston said it would be a ""very serious crime"" and could invalidate protesters' convictions. The Skye bridge between the island and the mainland opened in October 1995. Despite an outcry from the community about the way the Conservative government of the time had commissioned the bridge as Scotland's first Private Finance Initiative (PFI), the construction was seen by many as the route to economic prosperity for Skye. However, it soon became clear that this was to be the most expensive toll bridge in Europe. Car drivers were charged up to Â£5.70 each way, compared with an 80p charge on the Forth Road bridge. David Hingston, former procurator fiscal, said he thought someone had tried to ""paper over"" a very large hole BBC documentary The Battle of Skye Bridge draws together recollections from campaigners and the authorities, along with never-broadcast archive footage. The tolls were introduced at midnight on 17 October 1995. A storm was raging, but the uproar from the community was only beginning to stir. Cameraman Alex Ingram recalled the first cars arriving at the booth with the drivers refusing to pay the toll, then through the rain came a pipe band, walking across the bridge, followed by dozens of cars. And then, driver after driver refused to pay the toll. Several hours later, after refusing to leave, the protesters were charged and reported to the procurator fiscal. Andy Anderson, one of the organisers of that protest, said: ""What was important to me was on the first night, when I saw how many people turned up, [I thought] now we've got a chance, now we can fight them."" So began a long and creative protest under the banner of Skye and Kyle Against Tolls (Skat) that drew in islanders from all walks of life and attracted international attention. From driving flocks of sheep across the bridge to paying in pennies, the protesters sought to create drama as well as a disturbance. Out of hundreds of non-payment cases, 130 people ended up with criminal convictions, and some spent time in prison because they refused to pay fines. They are still fighting to repeal those convictions. Robbie The Pict established that the toll charges being collected for a US-based company could be illegal Robbie The Pict, a former policeman and RAF serviceman, took a leading role in the campaign and was charged for non-payment more than 100 times, leading to 25 convictions. He established that the toll charges being collected for a US-based company could be illegal. ""The secretary of state allowed a private company to demand tolls, but it has to be done via an accompanying document called an assignation,"" he told the documentary. ""Your name has to be on the assignation statement, otherwise it's unlawful."" Leaked documents seemed to prove that The Skye Bridge Company's assignation document provided to the court by the Crown Office was fabricated from contractual agreements between the government and developers. In an interview for the documentary, Mr Hingston said: ""It is a very important document. If it didn't exist then the prosecutions are wrong. ""It looked genuine, full stop. I had no reason to doubt it."" He said: ""I think the answer is there was no assignation and this document was produced to try and paper over this very large hole in the process. ""Someone, somewhere has perverted the course of justice and that's a very, very serious crime."" He added: ""One if the main problems with the Skye Bridge is that it is surrounded in secrecy. Everything is apparently financially confidential. It is ludicrous, frankly."" By the time the toll was scrapped in 2004, the Â£20m bridge had raised Â£33m for the American company that owned it. The Scottish government then bought the bridge for Â£27m and cancelled the toll. The total cost to the public was an estimated Â£93m. Mr Hingston, who had a nervous breakdown because of the stress he came under dealing with the case, said: ""As a fiscal I had to do what I did, but as a human being and a citizen I thought they were a scam. It should never have happened, it was outrageous."" Robbie the Pict told the documentary: ""It is a matter of justice. We are still fighting it and we will win it.""

"This video can not be played Ex-EastEnders actress describes how she was made to feel during her job-shaming story Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard. On Sunday, theDaily Star,externalrevealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford. It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"". ""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister. ""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible. ""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me."" She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about."" Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019. The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company. She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.

In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment. Tamzin Outhwaite posted,external: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs."" ""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out. ""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore. (L-R) Shane Richie as Alfie Moon, Jessie Wallace as Kat Moon and Katie Jarvis as Hayley Slater holding baby Cherry Slater in 2018 ""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while. ""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story."" Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself. ""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,""he tweeted,external. ""Then I didn't. ""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do."" In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon. Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out. She's no longer on social media. Katie Jarvis: EastEnders actress says she is 'fine' after reported attack Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers. ""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly? ""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general."" (L-R) Sorry We Missed You stars Debbie Honeywood, Katie Proctor, Rhys Stone, Kris Hitchen and Ken Loach at the Cannes Film Festival in May Jarvis is not the first and won't be the last actor to do a ""normal job"" before, during or after an acting career. In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries. Zero-hour contracts can 'kill' - Ken Loach The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs. ""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach. ""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in. ""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie."" He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake."" This video can not be played Director Ken Loach explains why he doesn't use Hollywood actors in his films. Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actorJeremy Edwardsfound work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener.

"Boris Johnson is urging MPs to back his Brexit deal in a final bid to get the UK to leave the EU in nine days' time. MPs will vote on the PM's Withdrawal Agreement Bill and if they back it they will be asked to approve a three-day timetable to consider the legislation. But the decision to curtail the scrutiny of the bill to three days has sparked anger from opposition MPs. Mr Johnson told the Commons backing the deal meant MPs could ""get Brexit done and move our country on"". But the BBC's Norman Smith said the PM looks set for a ""deeply damaging"" defeat over the timetable. However, the prime minister seems on course to win an important symbolic victory with MPs poised to back his Brexit bill in principle, our assistant political editor added. MPs will begin a number of votes on Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill,which was published on Monday,external, at about 19:00 BST. Elsewhere, European Council President Donald Tusk has told the European Parliament in Strasbourg he is consulting the 27 EU leaders on how to react to the UK's request for a Brexit delay and ""will decide in the coming days"". ""I have no doubt that we should treat the British request for extension in all seriousness,""he tweeted,external. LIVE: MPs set for Brexit bill scrutiny Kuenssberg: A big moment - with problems and opportunities What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Northern Ireland firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal Ministers have insisted they are confident they have the numbers to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill approved, despitelosing a crunch Commons vote on Saturday aimed at ruling out a no-deal Brexit. MPs believed by ministers to be ready to back the prime minister include pro-Leave Labour rebels and former Tory MPs now sitting as independents who would rather leave with Mr Johnson's deal than no deal at all. If MPs back the bill, they will then vote on the government's ""programme motion"", which sets out the timetable for the legislation's passage through the Commons. On Monday, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""People who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31."" Here it is. And here we go. The government has now published the pages and pages of new laws that need to be passed to make our departure from the EU happen. Forget the meaningful vote, to get Brexit done - as the prime minister never tires of saying - this whole bundle of legislation has to pass. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is a document of 110 pages that details exactly how Parliament is expected to put the deal that the prime minister agreed with his counterparts around the continent into UK law. For Brexit watchers it is a big moment. Read more from the BBC's political editor. If the programme motion is approved, the bill will then move to the committee stage - which will continue on into Wednesday - when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments. These are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to stage a second referendum. Both are bitterly opposed by the government, raising the possibility that it could pull the bill altogether if either gets through. Ahead of the debate, Mr Johnson said: ""The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 October and move on."" However, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, accused ministers of trying to ""bounce"" MPs into approving a bill that could cause ""huge damage"" to the country. Tuesday- second reading - MPs' first chance to debate the bill and vote for its continued passage. If passed at second reading, committee stage begins the same day. Wednesday and Thursday- committee stage - where detailed examination of the bill takes place and specific amendments - on a fresh referendum, for example - can be tabled and voted on. The bill then moves on to report stage, which offers further opportunities for amendments before it moves to third reading. This is MPs' final chance to debate the bill before voting on whether to approve it. If approved, it then moves to the Lords to begin a similar scrutiny process. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour was ""outraged"" by the government's attempt to push the bill through in a short time. ""When I did the Health and Social Care Act, which was a major piece of legislation, it took three months,"" the Labour MP told BBC Breakfast. ""In order for politicians to do their job properly, we do need to have time,"" she added. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said her party was ""outraged"" by the government's behaviour The SNP's Pete Wishart also condemned a lack of economic impact assessments of the deal ahead of the attempt to pass the legislation. Ex-Tory MP Rory Stewart, who lost the party whipwhen he voted in support of the Benn Act, said he would back Mr Johnson's bill in principle but wanted to ensure Parliament had a ""normal"" amount of time to debate it. ""We need to finish this in the proper way, and if we're going to deliver Brexit, we need to deliver it in a way that Brexiteers and Remainers believe was taken through Parliament fairly,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. But Mr Rees-Mogg said other acts had been brought and passed with short notice. ""A king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week,"" he added. And Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Breakfast that Parliament ""can move pretty quickly"" and has already had 500 hours of debate on Brexit. ""So most MPs, frankly, are very familiar with the vast majority of issues that are in this bill,"" he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg presenting the programme motion to the Commons on Monday The 110-page document will give legal effect to the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mr Johnson. His plan ditches the backstop - the controversial measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it essentially draws a new customs border in the Irish Sea, as goods which could travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax. It also will see the whole of the UK leave the EU customs union, meaning it could strike trade deals with other countries in the future. The WAB will also turn any agreed transition period into law, fulfil requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, and allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. But MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill. If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament, the default legal position is for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October, but that will change if the EU grants an extension.

This video can not be played Brexit: What actually happened on Saturday? Tuesday's votes come after Mr Johnsonfailed to get the agreement he reached with the EU last week signed off in the Commons on Saturday. MPs instead backed an amendment withholding their approval until the bill has faced the scrutiny of both the Commons and the Lords and been passed into law. The amendment worked alongside the so-called Benn Act, which required the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Following Saturday's developments, Mr Johnson sent an unsigned letter asking for the delay, along with a signed letter saying why he did not agree with any further delays. There has been no official word from the EU yet on whether the bloc will grant a delay or what length it would be. Mr Tusk said the result of his consultation with EU leaders ""will very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn't decide"".

"A firm founded by the youngest entrepreneur to secure investment on the BBC's Dragons' Den is on the brink of insolvency, the BBC has learnt. Gripit Fixings makes a product designed to fix heavy items to plasterboard. Its inventor, Jordan Daykin, was just 18 when he appeared on the programme. However, Mr Daykin left the company this summer and an insolvency practitioner has now been called in. The firm's board told investors it was in ""a precarious position"". Angry shareholders, who stand to lose their entire investment, have been reacting on a forum on the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube, which Gripit has used in the past to raise money. Finance app banks Â£2m from investors Some complained they had been misled about the company's strengths, others that Mr Daykin, who is now 24, had ignored requests for information. One said: ""The company is on its knees and Jordan has left it without any cares. I asked him a polite question on LinkedIn about it this afternoon and he very swiftly blocked me and removed my comment."" The news first emerged in an update to shareholders from the board and management team, seen by the BBC, which was sent out last week. It came after Gripit tried and failed to raise Â£1m in new capital by issuing new shares to existing investors. Gripit said the funding round had been under-subscribed and was therefore being cancelled. Jordan Daykin secured funding from Dragons' Den's Deborah Meaden Mr Daykin patented his product in 2012. He came to prominence when he appeared on Dragons' Den in 2014 and successfully secured an Â£80,000 investment for 25% of his company from one of the show's stars, entrepreneur Deborah Meaden. By 2016, Gripit Fixings were stocked in more than 3,000 UK outlets and exported to 32 countries. Gripit is still listed as an investment onMs Meaden's website,external, where she describes Mr Daykin as someone who ""knows his product and its market inside out"". Ms Meaden confirmed to the BBC that she was still an investor in the company. She added: ""I am pleased that the board and management team have taken quick and responsible action to address the challenges facing the company. ""I will support them in whatever practical way I can as they work towards achieving the best possible outcome for all stakeholders."" Mr Daykin, who left the business four months ago, said it was ""upsetting"" to find the company in such a precarious position. He added: ""Despite the mischaracterisation, during my time as CEO I always took pride in my communications with all investors. Since stepping back, all investor communications have been handled internally."" In January, the company was valued at Â£22.5m and had raised some Â£4m from investors. However, at the time of its last fundraising round in September, it was valued at just Â£6m. Now its investors face the prospect of losing all their money. ""Without a substantial cash injection, the company is not able to continue to trade into the future or deliver on its growth plans,"" said the update from Gripit. ""To this end, the board have secured the advice of an appropriate insolvency practitioner and will examine the company's options in the coming days.""

"Sunday Riley, founder of the eponymous skincare line Sunday Riley, the founder of the eponymous skincare brand, has been reprimanded for telling staff to write fake product reviews to boost sales. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found Ms Riley directed staff to post on beauty retailer Sephora's website. As part of a settlement, Ms Riley and her firm have been ordered not to post fake reviews in the future. But two FTC commissioners criticised the settlement and said Ms Riley and her company should be fined. The Texas based firm, which makes premium skincare products, was started 10 years ago by Ms Riley.

Sephora is a global beauty retailer, selling nearly 300 brands through its shops and website. Sunday Riley employees, including the founder, also created multiple accounts on Sephora using fake identities on a virtual private network in order to hide their company email addresses, according to the FTC. Victoria Beckham has been a fan of Sunday Riley products Sunday Riley had become concerned that Sephora was taking down fake reviews because the beauty retailer realised they were coming from the firm's IP address.

According the email quoted by the FTC, Ms Riley wrote: ""If you see a negative review - DISLIKE it. After enough dislikes, it is removed. This directly translates into sales!!"" The FTC charged the company and Ms Riley with two violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. A commission reached a proposed settlement that prohibits Sunday Riley and Ms Riley from posting fake reviews in the future.

"Robin McMaster's body was discovered after family members became increasingly worried about his whereabouts A woman who lived with her partner's decomposing corpse for more than a week and then claimed his prescription medication, has been jailed for a year. Angela Irwin, whose address was given as Holywell Hospital in Antrim, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a corpse. The offences took place between 13 and 22 November 2018. Irwin, who is 54, also admitted a charge of false representation on 21 November 2018. That involved ordering prescription medication from a GP on the pretence that such medication was for the treatment of another. The charges followed the death of 40-year-old Robin McMaster, whose body was found at Devenagh Court in Ballymena on 22 November 2018. Mr McMaster's body was discovered after family members became increasingly worried about his whereabouts. Relatives who phoned the home Mr McMaster and Irwin shared were told by Irwin that he was in bed with back pain and could not be disturbed. Irwin was originally arrested on suspicion of murder, but Mr McMaster's cause of death was later found to be ""most likely"" an overdose of Tramadol and other prescription drugs His brother entered the flat on 22 November last year to find scented candles burning and ""barged past"" Irwin to find Robin McMaster dead in the bedroom. He telephoned police who discovered a ""severely decomposed"" body. The court was told Mr McMaster's brother has since been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A prosecution barrister said police investigating the case found Mr McMaster had not been seen since 13 November - nine days before his body was found. However, medical evidence suggested he could have been dead between two and three weeks given the level of decomposition. Irwin was originally arrested on suspicion of murder, but Mr McMaster's cause of death was later found to be ""most likely"" an overdose of Tramadol and other prescription drugs he was taking for medical conditions. The court was told that a plumber carrying out work at the flat on 15 November had ""interrogated"" Irwin on the smell in the property. A day before Mr McMaster's body was found, the court heard Irwin ordered sleeping tablets and antihistamines from his GP in his name which she used herself. A defence barrister said Irwin wanted to ""convey her unreserved apology and sympathy"" to the family of the deceased. It was heard Irwin suffers from anxiety and depression, and has abused prescription medication. A judge said it was ""a very tragic case"". She read a statement from Robin McMaster's mother in which she detailed how she had called to check on her son to be told by Irwin that he was unwell, the details of what he had eaten that day and how she had helped him shower. In fact Robin McMaster was already dead. The statement continued: ""She kept my son lying there like a piece of rotting meat. ""I was unable to touch his hair or tell him goodbye. ""I am serving a life sentence as a broken mother."" The judge told Irwin she had been living a ""sad and squalid"" life at the time of the incident, and ""simply lived in a retreated world and denied what was happening"". Irwin was given a two-year sentence - one to be served in prison and one on licence.

"Sharm el-Sheikh attracted hundreds of thousands of UK visitors each year Direct flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh are to resume after the government ended a ban imposed in 2015. Flights to the Egyptian resort were stopped after 224 people died inthe bombing of a Russian airliner, linked to the Islamic State group. Egyptian officials have since admitted the airport fell well short of international security standards. The Department for Transport said there had been improvements in security procedures. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said lifting the restriction was ""the first step"" in resuming direct flights. Sharm el-Sheikh: Beating the flight ban Can Egypt's tourism recover from latest blow? Bomb fears halt UK-Sharm flights He said: ""The safety and security of British nationals remains our top priority and this decision follows close co-operation between our aviation security experts and their Egyptian counterparts, and improvements in security procedures at the airport."" The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office hasupdated its advice,,externalsaying it ""no longer advises against all but essential travel by air to/from Sharm el-Sheikh"". However, it says ""there remains a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation in Egypt"" and additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK. Travel company Tui said it would reintroduce Sharm el-Sheikh flights following the decision, ""taking into account customer demand"". EasyJet said it would ""look at any opportunities"" as a result of the lifting of the flying restriction from the UK. Trade organisation Abta said the lifting of restrictions was ""welcome news"" for its members. ""Sharm el-Sheikh has been a very popular destination for UK holidaymakers in the past, before the restrictions were in place,"" a spokesman said. ""The news is also positive for the local economy in this region of Egypt that is reliant on the benefits travel and tourism bring."" According to the Foreign Office, 900,000 UK visitors travelled to the beach resort in 2015, but that number dropped to 231,000 in 2016 after the ban on direct flights. UK holidaymakers heading to Sharm el-Sheikh were forced either to take multiple flights or book a place on a ferry from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Earlier this year, the Egyptian ambassador to the UK, Tarek Adel, told the BBC that Egypt had finished working with British security teams to upgrade its airports and was ready to welcome flights again. The plane was on its way to St Petersburg when it crashed After the UK government suspended flights to the Red Sea resort, more than 16,000 Britons stranded in the area were brought home on rescue flights amid increased security. The Airbus A321, operated by the Russian airline Kogalymavia, was brought down by a bomb on 31 October 2015 in the Sinai peninsula soon after take-off. Sinai plane crash: The victims End Sharm el-Sheikh flight ban, Egypt says Most of the 224 passengers killed on the plane in 2015 were tourists, including 219 Russian citizens, four Ukrainians and one Belarus national. Of the 217 passengers, 17 were children. UK security service investigators said they suspected someone with access to the aircraft's baggage compartment inserted an explosive device inside or on top of the luggage just before the plane took off.

"A firm founded by the youngest entrepreneur to secure investment on the BBC's Dragons' Den is on the brink of insolvency, the BBC has learnt. Gripit Fixings makes a product designed to fix heavy items to plasterboard. Its inventor, Jordan Daykin, was just 18 when he appeared on the programme. However, Mr Daykin left the company this summer and an insolvency practitioner has now been called in. The firm's board told investors it was in ""a precarious position"". Angry shareholders, who stand to lose their entire investment, have been reacting on a forum on the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube, which Gripit has used in the past to raise money. Finance app banks Â£2m from investors Some complained they had been misled about the company's strengths, others that Mr Daykin, who is now 24, had ignored requests for information. One said: ""The company is on its knees and Jordan has left it without any cares. I asked him a polite question on LinkedIn about it this afternoon and he very swiftly blocked me and removed my comment."" The news first emerged in an update to shareholders from the board and management team, seen by the BBC, which was sent out last week. It came after Gripit tried and failed to raise Â£1m in new capital by issuing new shares to existing investors. Gripit said the funding round had been under-subscribed and was therefore being cancelled. Jordan Daykin secured funding from Dragons' Den's Deborah Meaden Mr Daykin patented his product in 2012. He came to prominence when he appeared on Dragons' Den in 2014 and successfully secured an Â£80,000 investment for 25% of his company from one of the show's stars, entrepreneur Deborah Meaden. By 2016, Gripit Fixings were stocked in more than 3,000 UK outlets and exported to 32 countries. Gripit is still listed as an investment onMs Meaden's website,external, where she describes Mr Daykin as someone who ""knows his product and its market inside out"". Ms Meaden confirmed to the BBC that she was still an investor in the company. She added: ""I am pleased that the board and management team have taken quick and responsible action to address the challenges facing the company. ""I will support them in whatever practical way I can as they work towards achieving the best possible outcome for all stakeholders."" Mr Daykin, who left the business four months ago, said it was ""upsetting"" to find the company in such a precarious position. He added: ""Despite the mischaracterisation, during my time as CEO I always took pride in my communications with all investors. Since stepping back, all investor communications have been handled internally."" In January, the company was valued at Â£22.5m and had raised some Â£4m from investors. However, at the time of its last fundraising round in September, it was valued at just Â£6m. Now its investors face the prospect of losing all their money. ""Without a substantial cash injection, the company is not able to continue to trade into the future or deliver on its growth plans,"" said the update from Gripit. ""To this end, the board have secured the advice of an appropriate insolvency practitioner and will examine the company's options in the coming days."" Options included a restructuring plan or a sale of the business. ""Rest assured the management team and board will leave no stone unturned to secure a future for Gripit,"" the statement said, adding that the company would not be in a position to respond to questions for the next two to three weeks. When contacted by the BBC, the firm, registered as UK Building Products Ltd, issued a statement saying Steven Wiseglass, a director at corporate recovery and insolvency practice Inquesta, was providing assistance to it. ""As a result of a number of specific challenges, the company has identified the need to restructure and is examining the options available to it,"" it said. It said the process could take ""a number of months to complete"".

"Hashem Abedi was extradited from Libya to the UK in July The younger brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has denied murdering the 22 victims of the attack. Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a suicide bomb as music fans left an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds more, on 22 May 2017.

"This video can not be played 'The Brexit minister didn't really know the answer' Firms in Northern Ireland will have to submit declaration forms for goods heading to the rest of the UK, under the government's Brexit deal. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay was forced to make the admission after initially denying it was the case. This followed previous assurances that Northern Ireland-GB trade would be ""unfettered"". However, Boris Johnson has since told MPs there will only be ""light-touch checks"" between NI and Great Britain. Meanwhile, a government risk assessment has warned thenew Brexit deal could mean a reduction in business investment, consumer spending and trade in Northern Ireland. Giving evidence to the House of Lords Exiting the EU committee on Monday, Mr Barclay had initially said he did not believe exit forms would be necessary for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But he later conceded: ""The exit summary declarations will be required in terms of NI to GB."" The minister's admission came after questions from Labour peer Lord Wood, who later tweeted: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. ""What's astonishing is that firstly the Brexit minister didn't really know the answer and when he checked or was given notes from his officials, the answer became clear,"" Lord Wood told BBC News NI. ""Actually Northern Irish businesses are going to be required to fill out exit declaration forms - that's forms for every item they ship into Great Britain - and similarly Great Britain companies shipping into Northern Ireland. ""So from a commercial point of view, there is going to be a new border - not in a nation state sense - but a commercial border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson said the plan represented a ""clear breach"" of previous commitments made by the government. European Commission rules state exit summary declarations are needed when goods leave the EU's customs territory, but regular customs declarations are not required. In December 2017, the joint report agreed by the UK and EU as they began Brexit negotiations stated: ""In all circumstances, the United Kingdom will continue toensure the same unfettered access for Northern Ireland's businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market,external."" Under Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, the whole of the UK would leave the EU customs union. The UK will also leave the single market, but Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU rules relating to agricultural and other manufactured products. The Democratic Unionist Party has already said it would not support the planbecause it leaves NI subject to different rules than GB. Most of the changes in the revised deal are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit According to the government risk assessment, published on Tuesday, the costs of new checks and administration may affect the profitability of businesses trading to and from Northern Ireland. ""Due to data limitations around the number and nature of consignments of goods being moved from GB to NI, it is not possible to estimate the associated administrative burden on businesses,"" it said. It adds that HM Revenue & Customs has estimated that for trade between the UK and the rest of the world, the administrative cost of customs declarations ranges from Â£15 to Â£56 per declaration. But it cautions that it may not be possible to translate the same estimates to GB to NI trade. On the issue of exit declarations, the risk assessment states: ""Some practical information will need to be provided electronically on movement of goods,"" but due to ""data limitations"" it has not been possible to estimate the associated costs to business. In an evidence session with the Treasury Committee on Tuesday, HMRC said it had not calculated the administrative cost of the government's new Brexit deal for business. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, interim chair of the committee, said: ""Yet again, there is a void of economic information on the impact of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. ""It's astonishing the government hasn't analysed the impact of such a monumental piece of legislation."" On Tuesday, the government is beginning the final process of trying topush its Brexit deal through Parliament. MPs will be asked to vote on the legislation to implement Brexit - known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB). The 110-page document was published on Monday night and the government wants to get the entire bill through Parliament in three days. Brexit deal 'could reduce NI spending and trade' Brexit: Johnson in last push to get deal through LIVE: MPs prepare for Brexit bill scrutiny If they back his deal, they will then be asked to approve an intensive three-day timetable in which to consider the legislation. MPs have criticised the government for its proposed timetable, saying it is not long enough to scrutinise the details of the bill. On Saturday, the DUP, which the government relies on for support in key votes, helped inflict defeat on the government by voting to delay Brexit until the WAB has been passed in Parliament. Mr Wilson had said the party would also vote against the WAB in principle on Tuesday. If the government loses Tuesday's votes, it will be harder for it to meet its Brexit deadline of 31 October.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The suspect in the crash that killed Harry Dunn will be interviewed under caution in the United States, British police have said. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a crash outside RAF Croughton with a car owned by US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who later left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas had requested the interview. The Dunn family said they had ""lost all faith and confidence in both the police and the Foreign Office"". Speaking at a news conference, Mr Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas ""wants to be personally interviewed by officers from Northamptonshire Police in order for them to see her and the devastation this has caused her and her family"". ""She did not want to provide a pre-prepared statement which is her right to do so,"" he added. ""We do understand from colleagues in the US that the family is utterly devastated."" This video can not be played Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley says officers will travel to the US Mr Adderley said: ""This investigation has not stalled, it has not slowed down. The suspect not being in the country clearly frustrates the investigation but it does not stop it."" He also urged the Dunn family's spokesman Radd Seiger ""to exercise constraint in his commentary because it is not helpful"". The chief constable added: ""A file of evidence has been handed to the Crown Prosecution Service but...that file is incomplete - you can't complete the file until you have an account from the suspect."" In response, Mr Seiger said: ""We are glad that he has given a press conference and we will digest what he has had to say and respond. ""But all this noise will only stop when the family sees it is going in the right direction. ""The family have lost all faith and confidence in both the police and the Foreign Office."" Mr Dunn died from his injuries when his motorbike and a car collided outside the RAF station in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Mrs Sacoolas' husband was reportedly stationed at the base as an intelligence officer. At the time of the crash she had diplomatic immunity, but both the British and US governments agree that by returning to the US she had forfeited that right. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, left the UK after the crash Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family believe the US and UK governments, and Northamptonshire Police are all ""at fault"" for Mrs Sacoolas leaving the country. The force has not answered a number of questions the family has put to them about the investigation, she added. Mrs Charles told BBC Breakfast: ""It just seems to be one cover-up and one lie after another. ""We don't seem to be getting the truth from anybody."" Mr Dunn's father Tim said: ""We want the government to be truthful, we want the police to be truthful - there's justice in the truth about everything now."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Government knew Harry Dunn suspect would leave UK Dunn crash death suspect 'expected to be charged' Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has asked for all correspondence between the US Embassy, Foreign Office and Northamptonshire Police to be made public. After a meeting with the Dunn family earlier, she said she ""smelt a rat"" and would be ""digging"" on their behalf. ""My worry is that over the last three years, [the UK Government has] been pulling our punches with the current [US] administration. It's as though we're worried and scared of upsetting Donald Trump. I just think that's the wrong approach,"" said Ms Thornberry. ""There are times when you just have to stand up for British citizens. For heaven's sake, this family have just lost their teenage boy - if we are not going to stand up for parents like this, what are we about these days?"" She accused the Foreign Office of ""running around like headless chickens"" in the aftermath of the crash.

"Some cars parked on residential streets have been vandalised Almost 50 vehicles have been removed from residential streets in Manchester and nearly 3,000 fines issued in a crackdown on holidaymakers' cars parked near the city's airport. Last year, the city council set up adedicated enforcement teamto deal with issues caused by ""rogue"" meet-and-greet companies leaving cars in Wythenshawe. According to figures seen by the BBC, the council has made 25,000 callouts. But some residents say the crackdown has not made any difference. Manchester Airport hasscrapped free drop-offsoutside terminals and the railway station, with drivers now charged unless they use a free drop-off parking area about a mile away from the terminals. The council has also asked residents to report any issues after some cars parked for long periodswere vandalised. But Steph Emmanuel, from the Woodhouse Park area, said the parked cars remain ""a hell of a problem. We can't move anywhere"". ""Try and get a pram past on the pavement. You just can't, it's always chocker,"" she said. Neighbour Georgina Robinson said: ""They say they can park anywhere because they pay road tax and there are no double yellow lines."" Some people ""can get aggressive, so it can be intimidating"", she added. Almost 50 vehicles have been removed from residential roads Adam Jupp, from Manchester Airport, said: ""We're working with the council on a scheme to publicise firms with secure parking so people can make an informed choice. ""We've also been working with the city's highways team on changes to the road layout - yellow lines and closing off one-way streets - to hopefully disrupt some of this behaviour."" Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, executive member for neighbourhoods, said: ""This problem has not gone away and there is still work to be done, but I am confident the message is starting to sink in.

"Public sector borrowing has risen by a fifth during the first half of the financial year, official figures show. Borrowing for the six months to September has now hit Â£40.3bn,external, up Â£7.4bn from the same period in 2018. In the month of September, borrowing was Â£9.4bn - slightly lower than expected but still up from Â£8.8bn last year. The figures raise questions about the chancellor's room to manoeuvre in next month's Budget. Sajid Javid has said he is ""turning the page on austerity"" and promised big spending rises in his November statement. But John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Today's data showed the UK public finances heading further into the red, with the deficit more than Â£7bn higher in the first half of this financial year than the same period last year. Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy Budget date revealed by chancellor ""This borrowing overshoot will not make the chancellor's choices any easier as he heads towards his first Budget on 6 November."" According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the borrowing figures for September mark the first annual rise in that month for five years. The increase comes despite the government receiving a Â£1.1bn dividend boost last month from part-nationalised lender Royal Bank of Scotland. The ONS said borrowing was pushed higher due to seasonal payments of Â£2bn for winter fuel and Â£2.7bn of student loan write-offs - both of which are recorded in September each year. Sajid Javid is expected to loosen fiscal policy in the Budget Mr Javid plans to set out new long-term fiscal rules in next month's Budget. Currently the rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, but most expect him to relax this. ""September's better-than-expected public finance figures do not change this year's overarching themes of higher spending and borrowing. If anything, today's release will only encourage the chancellor to loosen fiscal policy at the Budget next month,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""We already know that the chancellor wants to review the fiscal rules in the Budget on 6 November, as there is very little chance of hitting the current ones. ""We don't know what the new fiscal rules will be, but they are likely to allow for a substantial loosening of fiscal policy at the Budget, which would support economic growth. Of course, whether this happens depends on whether there is a Brexit deal.""

"Adnan Ahmed was convicted of five counts of threatening and abusive behaviour towards young women Update: Adnan Ahmed's conviction was quashed on appeal after three judges ruled the verdict was a miscarriage of justice A so-called pick-up artist who targeted ""young and vulnerable"" women has been jailed for two years. Adnan Ahmed -  who called himself Addy A-game - secretly filmed himself approaching dozens of women in Glasgow and Lanarkshire. Ahmed was convicted last month of threatening and abusive behaviour towards five women. The 38-year-old from Maryhill, Glasgow, has also been placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years. Police launched an investigation after his actions were revealed by theBBC's The Socialearlier this year. The Seduction Game How a social media film exposed a pick-up artist The self-styled ""lifestyle coach"" would approach women in the street, often secretly filming the encounter and posting videos offering advice to other men. In the videos, he offered tips on how to overcome ""last-minute resistance"" to sex. One clip included audio of a woman apparently recorded during sex. This video can not be played Adnan Ahmed, also known as Addy A-game, approaches women in the street Five young women, aged between 16 and 21, gave evidence at his trial about how they had been intimidated by Ahmed in Glasgow city centre and in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire. Passing sentence, Sheriff Lindsay Wood said Ahmed - who has been on remand in prison since January - had shown a lack of remorse. He told him:  ""You gave evidence and said that the victims were lying or mistaken, but the jury thought otherwise. ""It was very obvious when they gave evidence how they were affected. ""You have acquired notoriety and an unenviable reputation, the public will be wise to such inappropriate behaviour by you and others like you."" The trial heard how Ahmed approached two schoolgirls in a secluded lane in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, in 2016, when they were aged 16 and 17. He called one of them ""pretty"", tried to get her phone number and made her feel ""uncomfortable"" but she walked away. Adnan Ahmed, appearing here in one of his online videos, claimed they were educational Another woman broke down in court as she described how Ahmed followed her through Glasgow city centre and grabbed her head as he tried to kiss her. The BBC investigation into Ahmed earlier this year revealed a wider pattern of predatory behaviour. Ahmed was part of a global network of ""pick-up artists"" who practise what they call ""game"". YouTube has sinceremoved hundreds of videosand deactivated two channels run by Addy A-Game and another group called Street Attraction following a BBC investigation into the online industry. A social worker who compiled a background report on Ahmed prior to sentencing described his behaviour as ""entrenched."" Defence counsel Donna Armstrong said: ""The accused accepts he was convicted and will change the way he speaks to women.""

"This video can not be played Ex-EastEnders actress describes how she was made to feel during her job-shaming story Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard. On Sunday, theDaily Star,externalrevealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford. It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"". ""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister. ""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible. ""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me."" She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about."" Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019. The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company. She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.

In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment. Tamzin Outhwaite posted,external: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs."" ""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out. ""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore. (L-R) Shane Richie as Alfie Moon, Jessie Wallace as Kat Moon and Katie Jarvis as Hayley Slater holding baby Cherry Slater in 2018 ""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while. ""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story."" Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself. ""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,""he tweeted,external. ""Then I didn't. ""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do."" In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon. Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out. She's no longer on social media. Katie Jarvis: EastEnders actress says she is 'fine' after reported attack Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers. ""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly? ""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general."" (L-R) Sorry We Missed You stars Debbie Honeywood, Katie Proctor, Rhys Stone, Kris Hitchen and Ken Loach at the Cannes Film Festival in May Jarvis is not the first and won't be the last actor to do a ""normal job"" before, during or after an acting career. In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries. Zero-hour contracts can 'kill' - Ken Loach The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs. ""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach. ""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in. ""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie."" He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake."" This video can not be played Director Ken Loach explains why he doesn't use Hollywood actors in his films. Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actorJeremy Edwardsfound work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener.

"Public sector borrowing has risen by a fifth during the first half of the financial year, official figures show. Borrowing for the six months to September has now hit Â£40.3bn,external, up Â£7.4bn from the same period in 2018. In the month of September, borrowing was Â£9.4bn - slightly lower than expected but still up from Â£8.8bn last year. The figures raise questions about the chancellor's room to manoeuvre in next month's Budget. Sajid Javid has said he is ""turning the page on austerity"" and promised big spending rises in his November statement. But John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Today's data showed the UK public finances heading further into the red, with the deficit more than Â£7bn higher in the first half of this financial year than the same period last year. Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy Budget date revealed by chancellor ""This borrowing overshoot will not make the chancellor's choices any easier as he heads towards his first Budget on 6 November."" According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the borrowing figures for September mark the first annual rise in that month for five years. The increase comes despite the government receiving a Â£1.1bn dividend boost last month from part-nationalised lender Royal Bank of Scotland. The ONS said borrowing was pushed higher due to seasonal payments of Â£2bn for winter fuel and Â£2.7bn of student loan write-offs - both of which are recorded in September each year. Sajid Javid is expected to loosen fiscal policy in the Budget Mr Javid plans to set out new long-term fiscal rules in next month's Budget. Currently the rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, but most expect him to relax this. ""September's better-than-expected public finance figures do not change this year's overarching themes of higher spending and borrowing. If anything, today's release will only encourage the chancellor to loosen fiscal policy at the Budget next month,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""We already know that the chancellor wants to review the fiscal rules in the Budget on 6 November, as there is very little chance of hitting the current ones. ""We don't know what the new fiscal rules will be, but they are likely to allow for a substantial loosening of fiscal policy at the Budget, which would support economic growth. Of course, whether this happens depends on whether there is a Brexit deal.""

"The government is consulting on possible designs for the number plates Drivers of electric cars across the UK may soon be using special green number plates under new plans. The aim is to make it possible for local authorities to allow zero-emission vehicles to benefit from incentives such as cheaper parking. The government hopes it will boost electric car sales, helping it achieve its 2050 target of net zero emissions. But Friends of the Earth said without better financial incentives and more charging points, little would change. The government is asking industry and the public for their views on how to implement the scheme. ""As the UK moves at pace towards net zero emissions, the initiative aims to raise awareness of the increasing number of zero tailpipe emission vehicles on UK roads,"" said the Department for Transport (DfT). The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Tesla gets go-ahead to build electric cars in China Dyson scraps its electric car project Are electric cars as green as you think? ""Through the introduction of green number plates, local authorities would have a useful visual identifier should they wish to introduce incentives to promote the use of zero-emission vehicles, such as allowing these drivers to use bus lanes and to pay less for parking."" CPT UK, the trade body for the bus and coach industry, said it would be a mistake to allow electric cars to use bus lanes. ""If local authorities allow some cars to use bus infrastructure, which is already severely strained and in need of significant investment, we will simply increase congestion for bus passengers and drive people off the bus and back into cars the vast majority of which are not electric,"" said chief executive Graham Vidler. Sales of all-electric vehicles (EVs) are up sharply since last year, leading to suggestions the market has reached a turning point. But all-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales and there arechallenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models. The government said a similar licence plate scheme introduced on a trial basis in the Canadian province of Ontario had led to an increase in electric vehicle registrations. However, RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""While the sentiment seems right, there are question marks as to whether drivers would see this as a badge of honour or alternatively it could foster resentment among existing drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles. ""On the face of it, drivers we've questioned don't seem too impressed - only a fifth think it's a good idea and the majority said the number plates wouldn't have the effect of making them any more likely to switch to an electric vehicle."" Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates urged the introduction of a national scrappage scheme, saying it would ""help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative"". This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? Rod McClair-Burgess regularly drives his electric car into the City. He says, incentives such as being allowed to use bus lanes would make his journey ""faster and easier"" and be ""a huge plus"". ""That would probably half my commute time and would be a real incentive for me for driving a car like this,"" he says. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK was ""in the driving seat"" of global efforts to tackle vehicle emissions, but wanted to ""accelerate"" progress. ""Green number plates are a really positive and exciting way to help everyone recognise the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads,"" he added. The DfT has issued three potential number plate designs and is consulting on which one should be adopted. The move comes as part of the government's Â£1.5bn Road to Zero Strategy, a package of measures aimed at making the UK ""the best place in the world to own an electric vehicle"". The Norwegian capital Oslo has plenty of electric vehicles.  You can spot them relatively easily by looking for an ""e"" at the start of each number plate. E-vehicles park for free in some public car parks which are loaded with charging points. And a commute in or out of the city in an electrical vehicle is generally much faster than in a petrol or a diesel car because on several main roads, electric cars can zoom down the bus lane. This type of incentive does exist in some parts of the UK (for example Nottingham has a bus lane which e-vehicles are allowed in) but the government hopes by marking low emission vehicles out with a green number plate more councils will do more to persuade drivers thinking about making the switch. In Norway, such incentives have played a role. But high taxes for petrol and diesel cars as well as tax breaks for electric cars, together with a good network of fast-charging points, have also been critical factors in pushing Norway beyond the electric adoption tipping point. In the UK, consumers get Â£3,500 towards the cost of a new electric car and if the vehicle is valued at under Â£40,000 it is exempt from annual vehicle tax. But the government admits the UK's charging infrastructure still needs to improve. This video can not be played Why is Norway the land of electric cars? Are electric cars as 'green' as you think?

"Home rentals site Airbnb has warned a tax inquiry by HM Revenue & Customs could lead to legal proceedings. A note in newly filed accounts for Airbnb UK said it had been contacted by HMRC over ""tax laws or regulations impacting the company's business"". ""The company is also subject to tax inquiries and proceedings concerning its operations and intra-company transactions,"" it added. ""Some of these matters may result in litigation."" The San Francisco-based company has two UK entities - Airbnb UK, which markets and supports the business, and Airbnb Payments UK, which processes payments between Airbnb hosts and guests outside the US, China and India. Last year, Airbnb UK paid tax of Â£146,059 on profits of Â£455,076 and a Â£14.2m turnover. The payments arm had a turnover of $353.7m (Â£273.2m), but it only made a $1.5m profit and paid tax of $303,823. In a statement, the company said: ""We follow the rules and pay all the tax we owe in the places we do business. That is true as rules apply today and will remain true for whatever rules apply in future. ""The Airbnb model is unique and boosted the UK economy by Â£4.2bn last year alone. The vast majority of money generated on our platform stays with hosts and local communities, which makes Airbnb fundamentally different to companies that take large sums of money out of the places they do business. ""As with many other companies, these are routine checks and we are working closely with HMRC.""

Airbnb plans to float next yearin what is expected to be one of the highest-profile share sales of 2020. In September, it said second-quarter global revenue reached $1bn, but did not say whether it made a profit. George Bull, senior tax partner at accountancy firm RSM, said: ""Nobody is saying that Airbnb has done anything wrong. The law is complicated, they have to decide how they are going to file their tax returns, they may do it on a basis that HMRC doesn't like. ""However, the phrase 'This may result in litigation' sounds quite serious. It sounds as though Airbnb is expecting a big tussle with HMRC to get these figures across the line."" He added: ""The UK company has a turnover of Â£14m and it pays tax of around Â£200,000, so people are saying, 'How can this be? Why are the figures so out of kilter?' ""The answer goes back to the 1920s. These basic tax rules for these companies are decades old and they really haven't kept up with the growth of the digital platforms."" Both eBay and PayPal paid extra tax in 2017 following a HMRC review. In recent months, Amazon and Facebook have come in for criticism over the size of their UK tax bills. Earlier this month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax. The proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google. HMRC declined to comment on the case.

"Sunday Riley, founder of the eponymous skincare line Sunday Riley, the founder of the eponymous skincare brand, has been reprimanded for telling staff to write fake product reviews to boost sales. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found Ms Riley directed staff to post on beauty retailer Sephora's website. As part of a settlement, Ms Riley and her firm have been ordered not to post fake reviews in the future. But two FTC commissioners criticised the settlement and said Ms Riley and her company should be fined. The Texas based firm, which makes premium skincare products, was started 10 years ago by Ms Riley. It sells its products around the world, including at Space NK in the UK, and counts Victoria Beckham and British model Jourdan Dunn among its fans. 'Why I write fake online reviews' Amazon 'flooded by fake five-star reviews' - Which? report An investigation by the FTC,external- which was sparked by a whistleblower's post on social news site Reddit - found that between November 2015 and August 2017 managers at the firm, including Ms Riley, submitted fake, positive reviews of its products on Sephora's site. Sephora is a global beauty retailer, selling nearly 300 brands through its shops and website. Sunday Riley employees, including the founder, also created multiple accounts on Sephora using fake identities on a virtual private network in order to hide their company email addresses, according to the FTC. Victoria Beckham has been a fan of Sunday Riley products Sunday Riley had become concerned that Sephora was taking down fake reviews because the beauty retailer realised they were coming from the firm's IP address. Ms Riley emailed staff to advise them on how to create fake accounts and told them to ""always leave 5 stars"" when reviewing Sunday Riley Skincare products, and to ""dislike"" negative reviews. According the email quoted by the FTC, Ms Riley wrote: ""If you see a negative review - DISLIKE it. After enough dislikes, it is removed. This directly translates into sales!!"" The FTC charged the company and Ms Riley with two violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. A commission reached a proposed settlement that prohibits Sunday Riley and Ms Riley from posting fake reviews in the future. However, two FTC commissioners who oversaw the case voted against the proposed settlement, and said that by not penalising Sunday Riley or seeking financial redress ""this action does little to address the epidemic of fake reviews online"".

"Former Thomas Cook staff protest in London after the company went into liquidation Audit firm EY, which signed off on Thomas Cook's financial health before its collapse, also wrote a report used to award its former boss a Â£5m bonus. The bonus, paid to former boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa, followed a heavily-criticised 2007 merger with MyTravel. Senior EY staff will on Tuesday appear before a panel of MPs investigating Thomas Cook's collapse. The audit firm,which also faces an investigation by the Financial Reporting Council, declined to comment. Christine Cooper, chair in accounting at the University of Edinburgh's Business School, questioned the ability of auditors to provide truly independent advice when they are paid for by the company they audit and, as in the case of EY, may have provided them with other advice in the past. ""These are smart people, but how could they get this so entirely wrong?"" said Professor Cooper. ""With all the regulators and goodwill in the world, if you are paying for a service, you are paying for a service. When you are paying someone for something, how much independence have you got?"" Dave Crichton was a pilot with Thomas Cook until the company's collapse Pilot Dave Crichton, who joined Thomas Cook from MyTravel in the 2007 merger, said he was ""angry"" about the company's collapse ""because I think it was resolvable"". ""I fly the planes, I see how many people are on them, I know what the seat prices are. And you think where I was, was an absolute cash cow."" Internal Thomas Cook documents seen by the BBC show its airlines business, which employed Mr Crichton, was on track to make Â£129m in profit this year - but he still lost his job when the wider group collapsed. ""It was a really cash rich company which just spent on businesses that came with debt.  That's... the biggest failing, that no part of it was salvageable,"" he said. Thomas Cook: What went wrong at the holiday firm? Thomas Cook boss grilled over Â£500,000 bonus Who are the family buying Thomas Cook's shops? Thomas Cook, whose founder was born during the Industrial Revolution, was Britain's oldest holiday company before being put into liquidation in September. The collapse cost around 9,000 UK jobs and left around 150,000 holiday-makers stranded overseas, who had to be repatriated at an estimated cost of Â£100m to the taxpayer. Its chief executive at the time, Peter Fankhauser, last week toldMPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committeethat the company was dragged down by its debts, which reached over Â£1.4bn in 2018. ""I'm sorry for not being able to turn around this company at pace and to really pay back this debt. ""Since 2012 we paid Â£1.2bn of interest costs and refinancing costs. Imagine if we had only half of that reinvested in the business, we could have been faster,"" Mr Fankhauser said. Former senior Thomas Cook executives told the BBC the company's debt problems began with the MyTravel merger. ""We were told we're carrying this debt from a deal that was done many years ago and now we've got this baggage around our necks,"" said one former executive, who asked not to be identified. ""What that means is we have to sell about 2,000 holidays to even pay a very small piece of that debt back. What we're doing is essentially working to pay back the interest,"" she said. The year after the MyTravel deal, Mr Fontenla-Novoa was awarded a Â£5m bonus under Thomas Cook's ""Secured Synergies Bonus Plan"". Thomas Cook's former chief executive, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, was paid a Â£5m bonus in 2008 Its annual report shows this was paid following ""an independent review of synergy benefits"" undertaken by EY in September 2008. ""These additional synergies include improved terms negotiated with accommodation providers and overseas agents together with increased hotel settlement income. ""Such synergies being enhanced as a consequence of a healthier negotiation position post merger,"" the annual report said. In 2018, EY (which changed its name from Ernst & Young in 2013),said it had ""nothing to report"" in respect of claims by Thomas Cook's directors,externalthat ""the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due"". In May 2019, Thomas Cook reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of its financial year and issued the third in a series of profit warnings. Around Â£1.1bn of that loss was caused by the decision to write down the value of MyTravel. By then, EY warned there was ""significant doubt"" whether Thomas Cook could continue as a going concern. Select committee chair Rachel Reeves said both EY and PWC, which audited Thomas Cook before 2017, could expect tough questioning at Tuesday's hearing. ""I think we should be able to claw back bonuses and salary when directors are culpable for running a company into the ground. But you should also have checks and balances, and the checks and balances are the auditors, are the regulators. ""All of them have questions to answer about the extent to which they were asking the tough questions the directors didn't want to answer,"" she said. Mr Fontenla-Novoa declined to comment. He is due to face the select committee on 23 October. With reporting from Luke Denne.

"Campaigners on both sides of the emotive debate were at Stormont on Monday Abortion has been decriminalised and same-sex marriage is to be legalised in Northern Ireland. Legislation making the changes - which waspassed by MPs at Westminster- came into force at midnight. The first same-sex weddings in Northern Ireland are set to take place in February 2020. The government has until the end of March to come up with regulations for the provision of abortion services. What Northern Ireland's abortion law changes mean How do the UK's abortion laws compare? The legislation took effect after the 21 October deadline passed without a devolved government being re-formed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - and some politicians from other unionist parties - triggered a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in an attempt to block the lifting of a near-ban on terminations. The assembly at Stormont had not sat for more than 1,000 days after devolved government collapsed when power-sharing coalition partners the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. But the move failed because a new speaker could not be elected on a cross-community basis. Abortion law in Northern Ireland had been more restrictive than in England, Scotland and Wales Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance, the Green Party and People Before Profit did not attend the Stormont sitting, which Sinn FÃ©in described as a ""cynical political stunt"". Before now, abortion was only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life was at risk or there was a danger of permanent and serious damage to her physical or mental health. Section 58,externalandSection 59,externalof the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 - which made abortion a criminal offence - have been repealed. NI parties fail in bid to stop abortion law change Reaction to failed bid to stop abortion law change TheNorthern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019,externalhas also placed a duty on the government to implement the recommendations of a report by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), published in 2018. The CEDAW report said abortion should be legalised where there is a threat to a pregnant woman's mental or physical health, without the conditionality of ""long-term or permanent"" effects. It recommended terminations should be permitted in cases of rape or incest. Charges can no longer be brought against those who have an abortion or against health workers who provide terminations The committee also said abortions should be allowed where there is ""severe fetal impairment"", but that provision should not ""perpetuate stereotypes"" towards disabled people. It added that social and financial support should be ensured for women who decided to carry such pregnancies to term. A further series of recommendations included providing access to ""high quality abortion and post-abortion care in all public health facilities"", and making ""age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education"" on ""sexual and reproductive health and rights"" a compulsory part of the curriculum. The government in London will decide on more detailed measures to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith is mandated to put in place regulations by 31 March 2020. Thegovernment has issued guidance to medical professionalswhich covers the period from now until that date. Same-sex marriages have been allowed in England, Scotland and Wales since 2014, but Stormont did not legalise them. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate The last of five votes on the issue in the devolved assembly - in November 2015 - resulted in anumerical majority in favour of same-sex marriage for the first time. But the DUP blocked a change in the law by using a veto known as the Petition of Concern. The new legislation says the Westminster government must bring in regulations to provide for same-sex marriage by 13 January 2020. Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry 28 days before doing so - the first gay weddings are expected to be held in the week of Valentine's Day. Northern Ireland's Catholic bishops said Monday was a tragic day for unborn children and a sad day for local democracy. They say they are also concerned at the redefinition of marriage and appealed to the political parties to re-double their efforts to restore the power-sharing executive. The new legislation has also had an impacton payments for those affected by the Troubles. The government is to bring in a payment scheme for those people injured during Northern Ireland's Troubles through no fault of their own. ""As the Northern Ireland Executive was not restored by 21 October 2019, the UK government will introduce a victims payments scheme by the end of May 2020,"" a government spokesperson said.

"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

Mr Dunn, 19, died in a crash outside RAF Croughton with a car owned by US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who later left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas had requested the interview. The Dunn family said they had ""lost all faith and confidence in both the police and the Foreign Office"". Speaking at a news conference, Mr Adderley said Mrs Sacoolas ""wants to be personally interviewed by officers from Northamptonshire Police in order for them to see her and the devastation this has caused her and her family"".

"The boys were stabbed at a house party in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two teenagers who were stabbed to death at a house party. The boys, named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, were attacked at the house in Milton Keynes at about midnight on Saturday. Thames Valley Police said the pair were stabbed as part of a ""targeted attack"". A 21-year-old man, from Milton Keynes, has been arrested on suspicion of two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. One of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. Another 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. One has since been discharged. Thames Valley Police said there was an ""increased presence"" in the area Thames Valley Police previously said those responsible ""arrived at the party at the house in Archford Croft uninvited, wore face coverings and were armed with knives"". Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter described the attack as a ""dreadful incident"". ""We know that the party was a private birthday party, and although we believe that all of those involved were known to each other, we believe that those responsible arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and they were armed with knives in what appears to be a targeted attack,"" he said. Det Ch Supt Hunter said the victims' families were being supported by specially trained officers and post-mortem examinations are due to take place on Tuesday. Forensic searches were still taking place on Monday Officers are expected to remain at the scene, which is in a cul-de-sac on a housing estate in the Emerson Valley area, for several days. Stains of what appeared to be blood could be seen on the front door of a house inside the police cordon. Two of Dom Ansah's cousins laid flowers at the cordon on Sunday afternoon. ""He was just so respectful to like his family and friends. Many, many people's hearts are broken,"" said one, who did not give her name.

"This video can not be played Welsh Youth Parliament member Tommy Church makes the case for teaching life skills Schools should teach more life skills to avoid producing ""A* robots with no knowledge of the real world"", the Welsh Youth Parliament has said. Its first major review suggested life skills such as dealing with grief and arranging a mortgage should be part of children's education. It called for the new curriculum to be amended on the basis of its findings. The Welsh Government agreed life skills were important and the new curriculum would develop ""capable learners"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams will address the recommendations when the Youth Parliament meets on Friday. GCSEs deemed 'not fit for purpose' The report identified ""large gaps"" in the life skills being taught in schools as well as too much emphasis on exams. ""We currently leave school with a handful of skills but no knowledge on how to speak in public, clean, maintain healthy relationships, buy cars, apply for mortgages, road safety, and many other skills that are needed to succeed in life"", it said. Kyra, 15, thinks many pupils will feel ""lost"" after leaving the school environment More than 2,500 young people were questioned as part of the Welsh Youth Parliament's research. It suggested that more than eight out of 10 young people had been taught about internet safety and dealing with bullying, only around one in 10 had learned about dealing with grief or political education. When asked which life skills should be taught, almost three-quarters of the young people questioned chose life-saving and dealing with stress. Kyra, 15, from Ysgol Nantgwyn in Tonypandy, agreed children should be taught more life skills generally to prepare them for leaving school. ""A lot of people probably come out of school after having so much support and then we just don't, it's all gone, and a lot of people are going to be lost from that,"" she said. Tomas, 14, said many youngsters do not have basic financial knowledge, like the difference between a credit and debit card Joining first Welsh Youth Parliament 'incredible' How do you score on this money quiz for teenagers? Mobile phone ban in school relaxed to 'ease friction' Tomas, 14, said financial literacy was one of the most important skills. ""Learning to spend your money responsibly is a good skill, because when most young people leave school, they... don't even know the difference between a credit and debit card, get a lot of debt and you spend your life paying back debt,"" he said. ""It's going to affect you for the rest of your life."" The Welsh Youth Parliament report said it was clear pupils were not being taught the subjects they valued, and said politicians and schools should ""listen more to young people when making decisions on their education"". The report found that life skills were often ""crammed"" into personal and social education days, which are viewed as ""days off"" by pupils. Survey results also suggested teachers did not feel comfortable in delivering the lessons and some were worried about ""not being in touch, and getting things wrong"". The report said the Welsh Baccalaureate was not ""successfully achieving its aim"", and therefore a new life skills qualification or certificate should be introduced for 16-year-olds. Other recommendations included a dedicated life skills lesson in schools every fortnight, a life skills coordinator in every school and a national life skills commissioner to oversee how it is taught across Wales.

"Campaigners on both sides of the emotive debate were at Stormont on Monday Abortion has been decriminalised and same-sex marriage is to be legalised in Northern Ireland. Legislation making the changes - which waspassed by MPs at Westminster- came into force at midnight. The first same-sex weddings in Northern Ireland are set to take place in February 2020. The government has until the end of March to come up with regulations for the provision of abortion services. What Northern Ireland's abortion law changes mean How do the UK's abortion laws compare? The legislation took effect after the 21 October deadline passed without a devolved government being re-formed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - and some politicians from other unionist parties - triggered a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in an attempt to block the lifting of a near-ban on terminations. The assembly at Stormont had not sat for more than 1,000 days after devolved government collapsed when power-sharing coalition partners the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. But the move failed because a new speaker could not be elected on a cross-community basis. Abortion law in Northern Ireland had been more restrictive than in England, Scotland and Wales Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance, the Green Party and People Before Profit did not attend the Stormont sitting, which Sinn FÃ©in described as a ""cynical political stunt"". Before now, abortion was only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life was at risk or there was a danger of permanent and serious damage to her physical or mental health. Section 58,externalandSection 59,externalof the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 - which made abortion a criminal offence - have been repealed. NI parties fail in bid to stop abortion law change Reaction to failed bid to stop abortion law change TheNorthern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019,externalhas also placed a duty on the government to implement the recommendations of a report by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), published in 2018. The CEDAW report said abortion should be legalised where there is a threat to a pregnant woman's mental or physical health, without the conditionality of ""long-term or permanent"" effects. It recommended terminations should be permitted in cases of rape or incest. Charges can no longer be brought against those who have an abortion or against health workers who provide terminations The committee also said abortions should be allowed where there is ""severe fetal impairment"", but that provision should not ""perpetuate stereotypes"" towards disabled people. It added that social and financial support should be ensured for women who decided to carry such pregnancies to term. A further series of recommendations included providing access to ""high quality abortion and post-abortion care in all public health facilities"", and making ""age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education"" on ""sexual and reproductive health and rights"" a compulsory part of the curriculum. The government in London will decide on more detailed measures to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith is mandated to put in place regulations by 31 March 2020. Thegovernment has issued guidance to medical professionalswhich covers the period from now until that date. Same-sex marriages have been allowed in England, Scotland and Wales since 2014, but Stormont did not legalise them. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate The last of five votes on the issue in the devolved assembly - in November 2015 - resulted in anumerical majority in favour of same-sex marriage for the first time. But the DUP blocked a change in the law by using a veto known as the Petition of Concern. The new legislation says the Westminster government must bring in regulations to provide for same-sex marriage by 13 January 2020. Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry 28 days before doing so - the first gay weddings are expected to be held in the week of Valentine's Day. Northern Ireland's Catholic bishops said Monday was a tragic day for unborn children and a sad day for local democracy. They say they are also concerned at the redefinition of marriage and appealed to the political parties to re-double their efforts to restore the power-sharing executive.

"The government is consulting on possible designs for the number plates Drivers of electric cars across the UK may soon be using special green number plates under new plans. The aim is to make it possible for local authorities to allow zero-emission vehicles to benefit from incentives such as cheaper parking. The government hopes it will boost electric car sales, helping it achieve its 2050 target of net zero emissions.

"Millions of Canadians have voted in another Liberal government under Justin Trudeau ""You did it my friends. Congratulations!"" he told cheering supporters in Montreal. His Liberal Party has lost its majority, however, and will rely on the votes of other parties It's been a bad night for Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party, although it may win the popular vote This election saw the largest-ever number of female candidates running Holly Honderich and Ritu Prasad This concludes our live coverage of Canada's 43rd national election. Justin Trudeau's Liberals have retained power, with a projected 156 seats. This is short of an overall majority, but more than the estimated 122 seats won by the Conservatives opposition. The prime minister will thus lead a minority government in his second term Want more election news? You can follow updates on our main story,here. Allow Twitter content?

So what is it? Wexit is the name of a campaign to see the western province of Alberta break away from Canada to form its own nation - perhaps with another western province. The idea has gained new momentum as relations between conservative Alberta and the rest of the country have deteriorated. If current election projections hold, there will be no Liberal districts in Alberta or Saskatchewan, CBC reports. Conservatives have claimed the overwhelming majority of seats in the two provinces. Read more about Wexit here. Green Party leader Elizabeth May gave her speech last - typically, the winning party goes last, but tonight, Trudeau, Scheer and Singh all spoke at the same time. May said the election had been a success for the party, which won its first seat outside British Columbia in New Brunswick. May said there would be ""crispy toes"" as she held feet to the fire in Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

government with a projected 155 seats out of 338. The Conservatives got 122,
according to the CBC election tracker. The Conservatives were just ahead of the Liberals
in terms of the popular vote - 34.5% to 33%. âLetâs remember this feeling, coming close
but falling just short,â Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said in Regina, Saskatchewan. The party made some gains, sweeping the
prairies, and picking up seats in New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia.
That leaves the Conservatives with 24 more seats now than they had in 2015. That, Scheer said, gives the party
âhopeâ that it can regain power in the future. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer told supporters in Regina, Saskatchewan, that he was proud despite the party's losses. Allow Twitter content?

""You did it my friends, congratulations,"" the prime minister said. Speaking at his headquarters in Burnaby, British Columbia, New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh told supporters: ""We are going to make sure the energy we built over the campaign... continues so we can play a constructive and positive role in the parliament Canadians have chosen.""

In 1972, Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau's father, won his second term as prime minister - by a slim margin that invites comparisons to 2019. The so-called Trudeaumania that had followed Pierre's first term had faded after his marriage to Margaret Sinclair in 1971. During the 1972 election, his Liberal party won 109 seats, while the Conservatives won 107. In 2015, Justin won his first term in a similar sweep by Liberals - only for that support to fade upon re-election. As of 23:30 EST (03:30 GMT), the Liberals have won 117 seats while the Conservatives hold 105. Pierre Trudeau in 1972 Conservative supporters are in somber mood as they watch results come in at Andrew Scheer's rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Montreal The mood is joyful if not jubilant in the
Liberal election headquarters in Montreal, where supporters are cheering results showing Liberal wins as they come up on the big television screens. They may not have their majority but the
Liberals are on track to win the most seats - and projections currently
suggest itâs not as close a race between the Liberals and Conservatives as
some polls had suggested. As one young supporter, Adam Steiner, 18,
told the BBC, a minority scenario is ânot greatâ but at least the party âkept
the Conservatives out of powerâ. What does this mean for Justin
Trudeau? If he does form a minority government itâll
mean compromises, since his Liberals will need outside support to hold on to power. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.060943246
"Boris Johnson is urging MPs to back his Brexit deal in a final bid to get the UK to leave the EU in nine days' time. MPs will vote on the PM's Withdrawal Agreement Bill and if they back it they will be asked to approve a three-day timetable to consider the legislation. But the decision to curtail the scrutiny of the bill to three days has sparked anger from opposition MPs. Mr Johnson told the Commons backing the deal meant MPs could ""get Brexit done and move our country on"". But the BBC's Norman Smith said the PM looks set for a ""deeply damaging"" defeat over the timetable. However, the prime minister seems on course to win an important symbolic victory with MPs poised to back his Brexit bill in principle, our assistant political editor added. MPs will begin a number of votes on Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill,which was published on Monday,external, at about 19:00 BST. Elsewhere, European Council President Donald Tusk has told the European Parliament in Strasbourg he is consulting the 27 EU leaders on how to react to the UK's request for a Brexit delay and ""will decide in the coming days"". ""I have no doubt that we should treat the British request for extension in all seriousness,""he tweeted,external. LIVE: MPs set for Brexit bill scrutiny Kuenssberg: A big moment - with problems and opportunities What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Northern Ireland firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal Ministers have insisted they are confident they have the numbers to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill approved, despitelosing a crunch Commons vote on Saturday aimed at ruling out a no-deal Brexit. MPs believed by ministers to be ready to back the prime minister include pro-Leave Labour rebels and former Tory MPs now sitting as independents who would rather leave with Mr Johnson's deal than no deal at all. If MPs back the bill, they will then vote on the government's ""programme motion"", which sets out the timetable for the legislation's passage through the Commons. On Monday, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""People who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31."" Here it is. And here we go. The government has now published the pages and pages of new laws that need to be passed to make our departure from the EU happen. Forget the meaningful vote, to get Brexit done - as the prime minister never tires of saying - this whole bundle of legislation has to pass. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is a document of 110 pages that details exactly how Parliament is expected to put the deal that the prime minister agreed with his counterparts around the continent into UK law. For Brexit watchers it is a big moment. Read more from the BBC's political editor. If the programme motion is approved, the bill will then move to the committee stage - which will continue on into Wednesday - when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments. These are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to stage a second referendum. Both are bitterly opposed by the government, raising the possibility that it could pull the bill altogether if either gets through. Ahead of the debate, Mr Johnson said: ""The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 October and move on."" However, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, accused ministers of trying to ""bounce"" MPs into approving a bill that could cause ""huge damage"" to the country. Tuesday- second reading - MPs' first chance to debate the bill and vote for its continued passage. If passed at second reading, committee stage begins the same day. Wednesday and Thursday- committee stage - where detailed examination of the bill takes place and specific amendments - on a fresh referendum, for example - can be tabled and voted on. The bill then moves on to report stage, which offers further opportunities for amendments before it moves to third reading. This is MPs' final chance to debate the bill before voting on whether to approve it. If approved, it then moves to the Lords to begin a similar scrutiny process. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour was ""outraged"" by the government's attempt to push the bill through in a short time. ""When I did the Health and Social Care Act, which was a major piece of legislation, it took three months,"" the Labour MP told BBC Breakfast. ""In order for politicians to do their job properly, we do need to have time,"" she added. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said her party was ""outraged"" by the government's behaviour The SNP's Pete Wishart also condemned a lack of economic impact assessments of the deal ahead of the attempt to pass the legislation. Ex-Tory MP Rory Stewart, who lost the party whipwhen he voted in support of the Benn Act, said he would back Mr Johnson's bill in principle but wanted to ensure Parliament had a ""normal"" amount of time to debate it. ""We need to finish this in the proper way, and if we're going to deliver Brexit, we need to deliver it in a way that Brexiteers and Remainers believe was taken through Parliament fairly,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. But Mr Rees-Mogg said other acts had been brought and passed with short notice. ""A king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week,"" he added. And Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Breakfast that Parliament ""can move pretty quickly"" and has already had 500 hours of debate on Brexit. ""So most MPs, frankly, are very familiar with the vast majority of issues that are in this bill,"" he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg presenting the programme motion to the Commons on Monday The 110-page document will give legal effect to the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mr Johnson. His plan ditches the backstop - the controversial measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it essentially draws a new customs border in the Irish Sea, as goods which could travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax. It also will see the whole of the UK leave the EU customs union, meaning it could strike trade deals with other countries in the future. The WAB will also turn any agreed transition period into law, fulfil requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, and allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. But MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill. If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament, the default legal position is for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October, but that will change if the EU grants an extension.

This video can not be played Brexit: What actually happened on Saturday? Tuesday's votes come after Mr Johnsonfailed to get the agreement he reached with the EU last week signed off in the Commons on Saturday. MPs instead backed an amendment withholding their approval until the bill has faced the scrutiny of both the Commons and the Lords and been passed into law. The amendment worked alongside the so-called Benn Act, which required the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Following Saturday's developments, Mr Johnson sent an unsigned letter asking for the delay, along with a signed letter saying why he did not agree with any further delays. There has been no official word from the EU yet on whether the bloc will grant a delay or what length it would be. Mr Tusk said the result of his consultation with EU leaders ""will very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn't decide"".
