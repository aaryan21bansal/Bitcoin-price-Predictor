"Ryan Ali is alleged to have been knocked out by Ben Stokes A man accused of fighting with England cricketer Ben Stokes tried to restrain the player from attacking his injured friend outside a nightclub in Bristol, a court heard. Ryan Ali, 28 was allegedly knocked out by the Durham all-rounder in the incident outside Mbargo last year. Mr Ali, of Bristol, is on trial with Mr Stokes at the city's crown court. Both men deny affray. Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted of the same charge on Thursday. Mr Ali told jurors his recollection of events was ""incomplete"" after he suffered a ""significant head injury"" outside the club in the Clifton triangle area of the city in the early hours of 25 September. Ben Stokes denies affray in a trial at Bristol Crown Court The jury previously heard Mr Ali had suffered a fractured left eye socket, a cracked tooth and cuts and bruises, while Mr Hale suffered bruising and a cut to his forehead. He said he could remember walking with Mr Hale and two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor ""having some banter"" when he saw ""what I thought was a tall blonde guy in the road charging towards me"". The court heard earlier that Mr Stokes stepped in to defend Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, who he said Mr Ali and Mr Hale had made homophobic slurs towards. Mr Ali recalled saying ""I don't want any trouble"" and said he was ""trying to calm [Mr Stokes] down"". ""He then turns his attention away from me and starts charging towards my friend, Ryan Hale, who is still unconscious in the road,"" he said. ""I saw that as an opportunity to try to restrain Mr Stokes to prevent him from attacking my friend who was laid unconscious on the floor."" Ben Stokes 'not threatening or aggressive' Ben Stokes 'stepped in' to defend gay men Ben Stokes 'mocked gay men before fight'' Ben Stokes 'spiteful before fight' Mr Ali denied being the ""initial aggressor"" in the incident and replied ""definitely not"" when asked if he had been looking for a fight. Mr Ali is alleged to have threatened Mr Stokes' England teammate Alex Hales with a bottle during the altercation, while it is claimed Mr Hale broke off a metal pole from a nearby road sign after being allegedly knocked out by Mr Stokes. Under cross-examination by Mr Stokes' defence counsel, Mr Ali agreed footage shown in court showed him striking Mr Barry with a bottle. He said he accepted at one stage turning a bottle upside down in order ""to defend myself"". Mr Ali said the last thing he remembered before waking up in the road was ""backing away from Mr Stokes, and getting him into a headlock"". Asked why Mr Stokes may have charged towards him, Mr Ali replied: ""I have no idea. I can make my own perception from all of the CCTV. He was very angry and he was looking for someone to pick on."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at the city's County Ground. Ben Stokes was arrested on the night of the fight in Bristol Earlier, the court heard from Mr Stokes's teammate Jake Ball who described him as being ""in a good mood"" before the alleged incident. In a statement, read on Mr Ball's behalf by Mr Stokes's barrister Gordon Cole QC, he said: ""He was chilled out. I would not say that Ben was drunk, he was calm, relaxed and controlled. He certainly was not looking for trouble."" The trial continues. Ben Stokes trial: CCTV footage of fight.

"M&S wants to move a third of its sales online Marks & Spencer is implementing the latest round of its store closure programme this weekend as it battles to improve its fortunes. Seven more of the retailer's clothing shops will be shutting their doors for the last time on Saturday. The latest closures are in Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall. In all, M&S plans to close 100 shops by 2022, asannounced in May. It says the turnaround is ""vital"" for its future. Profits at Marks & Spencer fell byalmost two-thirds to Â£176.4m last year, following a costly business overhaul. M&S warns more stores could close M&S 'should look at Amazon tie-up' M&S has said the vast majority of the staff working in the stores closed so far have been relocated within the business. However, it has warned that this will not always be possible and that more redundancies are likely. Under its plan, M&S wants to move a third of its sales online and plans to have fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations. It says it is facing competition from online retailers, as well as discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark. M&S is attempting to re-shape itself at a time when the High Street is under unprecedented pressure. Since the start of this year, a number of retailers have collapsed, including Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld. Other stores, such as DIY chain Homebase and clothing chain New Look, have announced restructuring plans of their own that involve closing large numbers of outlets. On Friday, department store chainHouse of Fraser went into administrationand was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct for Â£90m. Mr Ashley said he wants to transform the 59-store chain - which employs 16,000 people - into the ""Harrods of the High Street"". Administrators said some jobs could be preserved. House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Which High Street shops are opening and closing? Meanwhile, speaking after the takeover, Chancellor Philip Hammond hinted at possible tax changes to ensure the playing field is ""fair"" between online and High Street businesses. In an interview with Sky News, he said: ""The European Union has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses based on the value generated. ""That's certainly something we'd be prepared to consider."" There has been a Marks & Spencer store in Northampton for 111 years. A short drive away in Kettering, there has been one for 86 years. But Saturday's final day of trading is the end of the road for the 154 members of staff, and hundreds of customers who will use the two shops for the last time. Inside the Northampton shop, many of the shelves have already been stripped back substantially, causing the voices of the final few visitors to echo around what remains. ""I don't know where it's gone wrong,"" says shopper Eileen Smith. ""It's very sad.""

"Paul Pogba also scored in his previous game - the World Cup final Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho praised ""monster"" Paul Pogba after he captained the side and scored the opening goal in the win over Leicester City on the first day of the Premier League season. Pogba - linked with Barcelona this summer - was a surprise starter only four days after his return to training, having won the World Cup with France just under a month ago. The hosts made a flying start at Old Trafford, winning a penalty in the second minute when Daniel Amartey handled Alexis Sanchez's deflected shot. Pogba stepped up and, after a typically nonchalant slow run-up, placed the ball in the top-right corner above Kasper Schmeichel. Left-back Luke Shaw then scored the first senior goal of his career after controlling Juan Mata's aerial pass to double their lead. Substitute Jamie Vardy headed a late consolation for Leicester after Ricardo Perreira's cross had hit a post, and Foxes goalkeeper Schmeichel came forward for an injury-time corner but his header went wide. Pogba lasted 84 minutes before being replaced by Marouane Fellaini, but Mourinho said he did not expect the Frenchman to play for so long. ""Pogba was a monster,"" said the United boss. ""We thought maximum 60 minutes but he managed over 80. ""The decision belonged to Paul. I asked him and he made himself available and he was very good."" Jose Mourinho finds some harmony at last - Dion Dublin analysis Football Daily: Pogba and Shaw put on a show Follow reaction to the game here Lawro's opening-day predictions Pogba brought his World Cup form into the opening stages, producing a couple of excellent early passes before the opening goal. A penalty was fairly awarded with Amartey's arm high when he handled - although the video assistant referee was not an option to review the decision, with the Premier League the only one of Europe's top five leagues not using the system this year. Pogba - with two stars shaved into his scalp to celebrate France's second World Cup win - had a brief word with Alexis Sanchez before deciding to take the kick himself. After an unusual staggered run-up, he scored, although his celebrations were muted. He has now scored in his last two games - his previous match being the World Cup final when he was on target in a 4-2 win over Croatia. By the time he was replaced by Fellaini in the latter stages, at 2-0 up and seemingly safe, he had touched the ball more times and played more passes than any of his team-mates. He came off to handshakes from the bench after a good job well done. ""I didn't have any pre-season games, I came back on Monday so it was very hard for the legs,"" said Pogba. ""Winning the World Cup is in the past. I like challenges, I want to progress and win more trophies."" Fred, 25, spent five years in Ukraine before moving to United this summer United got their season off to a winning start but their performance, after a promising opening, left plenty of questions unanswered. Mourinho has appeared grumpy all summer after failing to sign any of his centre-back targets - including Leicester's Harry Maguire, who played the full 90 minutes at Old Trafford. The Red Devils fielded an unfamiliar back four, with Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof - who played a total of 99 minutes together last season - in the centre and Shaw and Matteo Darmian on the sides. Both centre-backs did well to deal with the threat of bustling Leicester forward Kelechi Iheanacho, although Darmian was given a torrid time by Demarai Gray in the first half. Shaw took advantage of his chance with his first goal since England Under-17s' 4-0 win over Lithuania in 2011. He took on Mata's high pass, beat Ricardo and then poked the ball beyond Schmeichel. ""Luke's game was very complete, even if I forget the goal,"" said Mourinho. ""He made maybe one mistake defensively in the whole match and the linesman could have helped him with a free-kick. He just has to keep going."" This video can not be played Shaw's performance 'very complete' - Mourinho Shaw - who has had a difficult time at United - said: ""I don't want to speak too soon after one game but I want to be up there with the best left-backs in the world. I have the foundations to do that here with the manager and my team-mates."" Fred, a Â£47m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk, was United's only debutant and looked solid - with passing accuracy of 92.3% - although he was booked for fouling James Maddison. He was partnered in midfield by fellow Brazilian Andreas Pereira, who also turned in a steady performance on his first Premier League start. Marcus Rashford started up front, with Romelu Lukaku on the bench, although he did not have a single touch in the box or attempt a shot. Maddison - playing behind striker Iheanacho - had two shots and put in six crosses before being replaced by Vardy after 63 minutes Foxes boss Claude Puel was thought to be in danger of being sacked this summer, but the club's owners instead backed him in a Â£100m spending spree. Maddison, a Â£20m recruit from Norwich after 14 Championship goals last season, looked good in the first half - playing plenty of passes in dangerous areas, as well as testing De Gea from 16 yards out. Ricardo was also bright before the break on the right wing - and had a shot saved by the United keeper, before having a hand in Vardy's late goal. Another debutant, Rachid Ghezzal - Riyad Mahrez's summer replacement - came on in the second half, as did goalscorer Vardy. Vardy's England team-mate Maguire was solid at the back for Leicester but unable to cause any of the mayhem he unleashed at the World Cup in the opposition box. Where he failed, Schmeichel almost succeeded when he headed Ben Chilwell's corner just wide. Only five goalkeepers, including Kasper's father Peter, have scored in the Premier League. This video can not be played Man Utd 2-1 Leicester: Man Utd penalty was 'harsh' - Puel Pogba cannot be fully fit after no pre-season games and less than a week of training, but the French World Cup winner was still the game's key player Former United boss David Moyes onBBC Radio 5 live:""If you were picking the fixtures for United in the first nine or 10 games, you're not playing City, United, Chelsea. I wonder with Jose's words the other day - 'let's wait until November' - I'd be very surprised if United weren't top of the league come the end of November."" Leicester boss Claude Puel to BBC Sport:""It was a good game, a good performance from my team. Certainly we lacked more energy in the second half. That's normal for the first game. ""We conceded an early goal, it was harsh. It was not a good result but it's a good performance. We gave our best against a great team. We deserved a different result - we deserved a minimum of a draw."" Manchester United have won on the opening day in each of their past four seasons, their joint-longest run in the Premier League (also four in a row between 2000-01 and 2003-04). Leicester are winless in their past 16 away top-flight matches on the opening day of the season (D8 L8) since a 3-2 win at Aston Villa in August 1933. United have won eight of their past nine home Premier League games against Leicester (D1), winning all three under manager Jose Mourinho. Mourinho is unbeaten in all 18 of his opening league matches of a season as a manager (W11 D7), winning nine of his 10 in the Premier League (D1). Pogba has scored in 11 Premier League games and ended on the winning side in all of them - a joint record he shares with former Liverpool player Ryan Babel. Leicester have conceded the first goal of the Premier League season in each of the last three seasons, also doing so in 2016-17 against Hull City and 2017-18 against Arsenal. Pogba's goal inside three minutes was Manchester United's fastest goal scored in a Premier League season opener - the previous fastest was Dwight Yorke after seven minutes against Everton in 1999-2000. Shaw registered his first senior goal in his 134th appearance in all competitions (67 games each for Southampton and Man Utd). Vardy has now ended on the losing side in four of the past five Premier League matches in which he's found the net (W1).

"The explosion happened on Friday afternoon at the military hardware plant One person has been killed and another seriously injured in an explosion at a military hardware factory. A fire broke out in a building where flares are made at the Chemring Countermeasures plant in High Post, Salisbury, on Friday evening. Wiltshire Police said a 29-year-old man from Southampton died at the scene and a second man was taken to hospital. A spokesman said the fire had been contained and there was no risk to people living in the local area. Wiltshire Police said the man's family had been informed but formal identification had not yet taken place. The force said the second man, a 26-year-old from Pewsey, Wiltshire, was in a serious but stable condition at Salisbury District Hospital. Earlier, police said an initial fire on the site, which makes flares, chaff, and decoys for use on aircraft and ships, had been extinguished. The company said manufacturing operations there had been suspended until further notice. Chemring Group business director Andy Hogben said: ""The site was immediately evacuated and the incident brought under control. Chemring has launched an investigation into the cause. ""The thoughts and support of Chemring Group are with the families at this time."" Wiltshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive are conducting an investigation into the cause of the explosion. Six fire crews, the ambulance service and police all attended the blaze at about 17:00 BST. Det Insp Simon Pope said: ""We are working closely with the Health and Safety Executive on this investigation to determine the cause of the explosion and our inquiries will be continuing at the site today. ""A cordon remains in place at the site while investigators carry out their enquiries. ""We would like to reassure the public that this incident was contained as soon as possible and there is no risk to those living in the local area.""

"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has agreed to buy the House of Fraser department store chain for Â£90m. The deal was announced just hours after the 169-year-old chain went into administration when talks with its creditors failed to reach an agreement. Mr Ashley said his plan was to turn the 59-store chain in to the ""Harrods of the High Street"". It employs 16,000, 5,900 directly and 10,100 in concessions. Administrators said jobs could be ""preserved"". While some stores did not open on time on Friday, initial problems with the website were resolved. There were reports, though, that gift cards were not being accepted. Sports Direct said in a statement:,external""The group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business."" Sports Direct already held an 11% stake in the department store chain, which had been intending to close 31 shops under a now-abandoned restructuring plan. House of Fraser's administrators, from accountants EY, said the department store chain had been in ""a race against time to secure sufficient funding to secure its future"" ever since the Chinese firmC.banner pulled out of a rescue dealearlier this month. House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Which High Street shops are opening and closing? The Scottish retail empire struggling to fight back Before Friday's deal was announced, 6,000 roles were to have been lost. Alan Hudson, one of the four administrators from accountants EY, said the Sports Direct deal ""preserves as many of the jobs of House of Fraser's employees as possible"". ""We hope that this [deal] will give the business the stable financial platform that it requires to flourish in the current retail environment"". But union officials at Unite said staff were entering ""a period of great uncertainty and worry"". Unite regional officer Scott Lennon said: ""Sports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope that its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser."" Mike Ashley already held an 11% stake in House of Fraser Mr Ashley founded the 750-strong sports fashion chain Sports Direct in 1982.  Among the brands it owns are Slazenger, Karrimor, and the sports retailer Lillywhites. It has also encountered controversy. Areport by the Business, Innovation and Skills committeein 2016 concluded that the company did not treat its workers like humans, but Sports Direct said its policy was to treat all people with respect. He has a varied portfolio of investments, including in department store Debenhams and the retailer French Connection. In addition, he owns the lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, as well as the clothing chain Flannels, which sells brands such as Burberry London, Fendi and Sophia Webster. Mr Ashley is also the owner of Newcastle United, although he attempted to sell the football club earlier this year. Chinese firm C.banner had been poised to invest in the store after it agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors. This would have closed 31 stores and put 6,000 jobs at risk. But it could not raise the financing, leaving House of Fraser seeking new investment. On Thursday, House of Fraser had indicated time was running out whenit said it wanted to secure financing by 20 August. This was the date when concessions in the stores were scheduled to be paid. As well as problems with its owners, the chain hadtoo many stores, was slow to develop its internet shopping capability and failed to entice enough shoppers. More may stay open. Mr Ashley said: ""We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible."" ""My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street,"" he said, indicating a move upmarket. ""This is a massive step forward and further enhances our strategy of elevation across the group. This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector,"" he added. There had been speculation he might take the opportunity to expand the Sports Direct chain, which he has previously said he wants to transform into ""the Selfridges of sport"". Analysts said he would need to spend more money.  Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""To give House of Fraser the best chance of survival, Sports Direct and its owner Mike Ashley must make drastic changes to both its product proposition and store environment to entice shoppers back."" Kate Hardcastle, from the retail consultancy Insight with Passion, told the BBC a move downmarket was more likely. ""This is a big move and I'm sure lots of people will be breathing a slight sigh of relief that the name House of Fraser isn't disappearing from the High Street altogether,"" she said. ""However, I can't imagine that the business or indeed its offer are going to be similar to that people know or recognise as House of Fraser - this is someone who deals very much in the discount market."" House of Fraser has two main types of relationships with its suppliers: wholesalers, who get paid whether or not their stock is sold, or concession holders, who are paid after their items are sold. Nigel Lugg, group executive chairman of Prominent Europe, which supplies Chester Barrie menswear to House of Fraser, said it was ""good news"" that the business had been saved. But, he said, suppliers would have hoped the business would avoid administration, so they could be paid in full. ""I can't see the suppliers getting a lot of money out of the system,"" Mr Lugg told the BBC, adding suppliers often received 2p to 3p in the pound in cases of administration. His business would be fine but, he said, ""it could impact into other UK suppliers"". ""There is a lot of money trapped in the system,"" Mr Lugg said. Mr Ashley referred to some suppliers when he announced the deal. He said: ""It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands.""

"Boxing and all martial arts are currently banned in prisons in England and Wales Boxing should be taught in prisons in England and Wales in an effort to improve discipline and boost education, an independent expert has said. A report for the Ministry of Justice said ministers should consider allowing combat sports - with the current ban a ""missed opportunity"" to cut offending. The author, Professor Rosie Meek, said boxing was already taking place ""illicitly"" but could be used for good. The MoJ said it had ""no plans"" to allow boxing or martial arts in prisons. In a report, which was commissioned by the MoJ, Professor Meek reviewed the current provision of sport in prisons, young offenders' institutions and secure children's homes. She said her research found ""some really exciting work going on in prisons"". However, the psychologist and prison researcher said it was not widespread and there were ""missed opportunities for using sport in efforts to reduce reoffending"". She said ""professional staff"" from across the secure estate - alongside male and female prisoners - had expressed frustration that boxing-related programmes were not offered in prison. Currently, there is a blanket ban on all martial arts and boxing in prisons in England and Wales. Prof Meek said boxing programmes offered at some secure children's homes and secure training centres were ""well received and highly valued"" for behaviour management. Olympic medallist Nicola Adams has spoken previously about the benefits of boxing She called on the government to ""re-consider"" its policy and pilot the introduction of ""targeted programmes which draw on boxing exercises, qualifications and associated activities"". Although the government accepted some of Prof Meek's findings, it refused to reassess its blanket ban on martial arts in prison. A statement from the Ministry of Justice said: ""Our priority must be the safety and security of the custodial environment and the wellbeing of staff, participants and other prisoners. ""We have no plans to make boxing or martial arts-based activities permissible."" Last month, the Observer newspaper reported,externalthat former justice minister Philip Lee - who commissioned the report - accused the government of ""cowardice"" following claims a cabinet member told colleagues to dismiss the findings. Prof Meek told the BBC: ""I was disappointed that there's currently a blanket ban in public sector prisons on any martial art-related activities. ""I think there's a really valuable place for boxing-related activities in promoting self-discipline, teamwork and building up positive relationships."" She added that in community settings, children vulnerable to involvement in gang violence and drug use ""have responded really well to [boxing]"".

"Lewis Ludlow appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from prison A man has pleaded guilty to plotting a terror attack on London's Oxford Street and raising money for terrorism. Lewis Ludlow, 26, planned to hire a van and hit pedestrians and also targeted Madame Tussauds and St Paul's Cathedral, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey and is due to be sentenced on 2 November. Ludlow, who also used the name Ali Hussain, had hoped to kill up to 100 people. A spokesman for the CPS said he had been under 24-hour armed police surveillance. Ludlow, from Rochester, Kent, first came to the attention of police in 2010 when he attended a demonstration led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned Al-Muhajiroun group. When Ludlow was arrested in 2015, Islamic State group material was found on his electronic devices but no further action was taken. He had also been in contact with Junaid Hussain, an IS fighter from the UK who waskilled in drone strike in 2016, the prosecution said. Police also observed Ludlow at Al-Muhajiroun group demonstrations, where he was seen with, or near, Anjem Choudary and Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale. Ludlow claimed he was travelling to the Philippines as a sex tourist In January, Ludlow bought a ticket to fly to the Philippines but he was stopped at the airport and his passport seized. He claimed he was going to the country as a sex tourist but was found to have been in communication with a man named Abu Yaqeen in an area with a significant IS presence. In March, Ludlow sent him money via PayPal and created the Facebook account Antique Collections, which he was alleged to have used as a front to send money to south-east Asia for terrorism. On 16 March, Ludlow went online to establish whether there was a police station on Oxford Street, before setting out to take pictures of the shopping area. He took a picture near to the Oxford Circus Tube station and then a second one outside the Disney store. Later he photographed Madame Tussauds and a bus shelter map of the area around the tourist attraction. The images were stored in an encrypted application on his phone shared among IS supporters. Ludlow made detailed notes of possible targets in London When police searched Ludlow's home, they also found torn-up notes detailing when the targets would be the busiest. The first note read: ""Madame Tussads [sic]. Oxford street busiest time between 11 - 12 particularly Fridays. St Paul's Cathedral. Shia temple... Further locations scouted for the Kil [sic]."" A second read: ""Crowded London Areas, Oxford Street - long road with no bollards or barriers preventing a van mounting the pavement. Busiest time is between 11am - 12pm with Saturday being the busiest day. ""It is a busy street it is ideal for an attack. It is expected nearly 100 could be killed in the attack."" Two further notes referred to accommodation and van rental. In a communication found on one of his phones Ludlow, who did not hold a driving licence, said: ""Driving isn't easy Only reason why I never learnt is because its expensive plus a bit scared of crashing."" Ludlow took photos of Oxford Street He also travelled to Madame Tussauds on Baker Street The CPS spokesman said: ""A mobile phone belonging to Ludlow was found in the storm drain of his home and contained photographs he had taken in March on a trip to London. The phone also contained videos in which Ludlow stated his hatred of unbelievers and his desire to establish Sharia law. Ludlow, who appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from HMP Belmarsh, also pleaded guilty to setting up Facebook and Paypal accounts which the CPS said he used to fund fighters based in the Philippines. He had been previously questioned by police about his links to Anjem Choudary and the banned Al-Muhajiron group. Ludlow also admitted raising funds for terrorist purposes but denied preparing a plan to travel to the Philippines to join jihadists there. That charge will remain on file.

"Crops are often treated with the herbicide glyphosate Chemical giant Monsanto has been ordered to pay $289m (Â£226m) damages to a man who claimed herbicides containing glyphosate had caused his cancer. In a landmark case, a Californian jury found that Monsanto knew its Roundup and RangerPro weedkillers were dangerous and failed to warn consumers. It's the first lawsuit to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer. Monsanto denies that glyphosate causes cancer and says it intends to appeal against the ruling. ""The jury got it wrong,"" vice-president Scott Partridge said outside the courthouse in San Francisco. EU settles dispute over weedkiller glyphosate UK 'will support' pesticide ban The villagers who fear herbicides The claimant in the case, groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, is among more than 5,000 similar plaintiffs across the US. Correspondents say the California ruling is likely to lead to hundreds of other claims against Monsanto, which was recently bought by the German conglomerate Bayer AG. Mr Johnson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. His lawyers said he regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. Analysis by James Cook, BBC North America Correspondent The implications of this verdict will be felt far beyond Monsanto's headquarters in Missouri. Glyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller and the science about its safety is still far from settled. In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer,the World Health Organisation's cancer agency, concluded that it was ""probably carcinogenic to humans"",external. but the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to insist that glyphosate is safe when used carefully. Campaigners question how the EPA assessment was reached, citing evidence of what they say was inappropriate industry involvement in the decision. Some Democrats have even called for a Department of Justice investigation intoalleged collusion between government officials and Monsanto,external. In California, where a judge recently ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning, the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate even thoughthe state lists it as a chemical known to cause cancer,external. In Europe, too, the battle over glyphosate has been fierce. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to ban it despite the resistance of some French lawmakers and the fact thatthe European Commission recently granted the weedkiller another five-year licence. Jurors found on Friday that the company had acted with ""malice"" and that its weedkillers contributed ""substantially"" to Mr Johnson's terminal illness. Following an eight-week trial, the jury ordered the agricultural multi-national to pay $250m in punitive damages together with other costs that brought the total figure to almost $290m. Mr Johnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, said the jury's verdict showed that the evidence against the product was ""overwhelming"". ""When you are right, it is really easy to win,"" he said, adding that the ruling was just ""the tip of the spear"" of future legal cases. Dewayne Johnson (R) hugged his lawyer after hearing the verdict In a statement after the ruling, Monsanto said it was ""sympathetic to Mr Johnson and his family"" but it would ""continue to vigorously defend this product, which has a 40-year history of safe use"". ""Today's decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews - and conclusions by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and regulatory authorities around the world - support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr Johnson's cancer,"" it added.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties The Saudi-led military coalition has announced it will investigate an air strike in Yemen which killed at least 29 children. On its Twitter feed, Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV quoted a senior official who said the coalition was probing ""collateral damage"" from the strike. Forces struck a bus in Dahyan in the rebel-held province of Saada. The coalition backs Yemen's government against the Houthi rebels and initially deemed its actions ""legitimate"". But now the coalition intends to investigate the strike, with Al-Arabiya TV quoting the official as saying they will ""bring the perpetrators to account and compensate the victims"". Child graves have been dug The Houthi-affiliated health ministry now says the death toll from the strike has risen to 51 in total, including 40 children, with a further 79 injured. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an ""independent and prompt investigation"",externalinto the strike, his spokesperson said. UK Foreign Office ministerAlistair Burt also stated the need for a ""transparent investigation"",external, posting on Twitter that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the attack. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Council, tweeted that he was prepared to co-operate with an international inquiry. The bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,external, transporting local civilians, including many schoolchildren, Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press news agency. The children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink, the charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The Houthi health ministry says at least 40 children were killed in the attack Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Yemen war: What life is like for children in the country Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"Matthew Newton is a director, writer and actor The director of a new film starring Jessica Chastain has stepped down after criticism surrounding a history of domestic abuse allegations against him. Matthew Newton was announced as the director of Eve last week. He faced a string of allegations in his native Australia between 2007 and 2012. On Friday he said he was ""profoundly aware that I have a responsibility to lead where I have failed in the past"". Chastain has been one of the leading supporters of the #TimesUp movement. The Oscar-nominated actress has not commented on Newton's decision. Jessica Chastain is known for films including Zero Dark Thirty and Interstellar Newton is also an actor and wrote the script for Eve, whichhas been described by Variety,externalas a ""character-driven action movie"". In a statement, he said: ""Yesterday I notified Jessica Chastain and the other producers on the film Eve that I will be stepping down as director. ""Since the announcement of this film, the responses, which are powerful and important, have not fallen on deaf ears. I am profoundly aware that I have a responsibility to lead where I have failed in the past. ""I can never undo the harm that I've caused the people I've cared about and I carry that shame and responsibility with me every day. ""Over the past eight years I have been working extensively with healthcare professionals to help me overcome my addiction and mental health illness. ""For the past six years I have lived a quiet and sober life. All I can do now is try to be a living amends and hopefully contribute to the positive change occurring in our industry."" A backlash had been mounting after fans and media highlighted past allegations against him. In 2007 he was convicted of assaulting actress Brooke Satchwell, but the conviction was overturned when the judge accepted Newton had suffered a ""severe depressive disorder"". Three years later, he was given a two-year apprehended domestic violence order after his girlfriend, actress Rachael Taylor, accused him of two assaults. The following year he was accused of breaching the order and was told to remain under psychiatric care. Newton's previous films include last year's Who We Are Now, starring Julianne Nicholson and Zachary Quinto.

"Samuel Eni was leaving a supermarket at Paddington train station in London when he was stopped by a police officer and asked to explain what he was doing. The 28-year-old hadn't committed an offence and wasn't searched - but was told he needed to ""account for his presence"" there. He says he was stopped under the stop and account police power - which is when an officer stops someone and asks what they're doing. Sam believes it happened because he's black but the Metropolitan Police says it was part of a joint operation with the British Transport Police. He filmed the incident and posted the footage on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sam says he started filming the incident because he was confused about stop and account, having never heard of it before. ""I had no problem with complying, but the grounds he was stopping me on just didn't make sense,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""After I'd asked him if I fitted into a profile of a criminal or terrorist, he said 'No'."" Sam missed his train to work because he was stopped by the police officer. He says he believes ""100%"" that he was stopped because he is black and worries how others might react if it happened to them. Anyone approached under stop and account is legally entitledto walk away at any point,external. But Sam worries that because so few people seem to know about the procedure, they will be unaware of their rights. ""I felt like that's something they could take advantage of,"" he adds. ""I didn't feel I could leave at any point."" Newsbeat has asked the National Police Chief's Council when stop and account was introduced, but as yet it has not responded. Police do not need to make a record of stop and account incidents The Metropolitan Police say Sam was stopped as part of Project Servator, which aims to tackle terrorism and other offences, and includes ""highly visible and covert police officers"" who are ""specially trained to spot the tell-tale signs and behaviour of individuals who may have criminal intent"". ""As part of this activity, a number of people were spoken to and asked to account for their presence, including a 28-year-old man,"" they said in a statement. ""The tactic is based on extensive research into the psychology of criminals and how to undermine their activities."" According toWest Yorkshire Police,external, stop and account is when an officer stops and asks you what you are doing, why you are in a specific area or what you are carrying. It's important to know that the police officer doesn't have the power to make you stay if you are stopped under stop and account. It is different to stop and search, which come with much stricter legal conditions. There is no national requirement for police forces to make any record of how many stop and accounts they carry out or the ethnicity of those stopped,according to the College of Policing,external. Instead, they are allowed to decide for themselves whether they wish to do so. If a person stopped and asked to account for themselves wants information on how to complain about how they've been treated, an officer should provide this. In 2013,the Home Office said,externalstop and account was not a defined power set out in primary legislation, but an ""important part of on-street policing"". ""It constitutes the next step beyond the general conversations officers have with members of the public every day."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"The actor won an Oscar for his role in 2016 drama Manchester by the Sea Actor Casey Affleck has apologised for the ""unprofessional environment"" on the set of his 2010 film I'm Still Here. ""I behaved in a way, and I allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional, and I'm sorry,""he told the Associated Press,external. The Oscar winner was sued by two female crew members who accused him of sexual harassment while working on the mockumentary film, which he directed. Affleck denied the allegations and the lawsuits were settled out of court. Affleck settles harassment claim ""That I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret,"" he said. ""I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing, and I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't agree with everything, the way I was being described and the things that were said about me,"" Affleck said. ""But I wanted to try to make it right, and so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time."" Affleck was also a producer on I'm Still Here, in which actor Joaquin Phoenix was seen pretending to launch a musical alter-ego. He said that meant ""the buck had to stop"" with him and that he had ""to accept responsibility"" for what took place on the set. Affleck's accusers, producer Amanda White and director of photography Magdalena Gorka, alleged that they were repeatedly subjected to sexual innuendoes and unwanted advances. ""It was an unprofessional environment,"" Affleck said.

"Nine-year-old chess prodigy Shreyas Royal and his family have been allowed to stay in the UK. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he took the ""personal decision"" as Shreyas is ""one of the most gifted chess players in his generation"". Shreyas Royal has lived in Britain since he was three years old. His family was told they would have to return to India when his father's work visa expired in September, but they can now stay under a new work visa. Jitendra Singh, Shreyas's father, received an email from the Home Office on Friday informing him of their decision. He told the BBC the family was ""very happy and relieved"" and that Shreyas ""started jumping on the sofa"" upon hearing the news. This video can not be played Shreyas Royal reacts to the home secretary's decision Shreyas said: ""I was jumping here and there and dancing. I was really happy today. ""I want to be the best at it and become the world chess champion at the age of 18."" Mr Singh's five-year work visa was due to expire next month and he had been told it could not be extended unless he earned Â£120,000 a year, which he does not. The home secretary said: ""After carefully reviewing the evidence, I have taken the personal decision to allow Shreyas and his family to stay in the UK. ""The UK is a country that fosters world class talent and Shreyas is one of the most gifted chess players in his generation. ""We have always been clear we want a world-class immigration system that welcomes highly-talented individuals from across the globe."" Shreyas Royal has competed in European and world championship tournaments Shreyas was born in India but the family moved to south London when his father was offered a job as an IT project manager in the UK. He started learning chess three years ago and has since represented England internationally. He is ranked second in the world for his age group. Mr Singh will be able to apply for the Tier 2 work visa, which is valid for up to five years, without needing to leave the UK. It will be sponsored by his employers, Tata Consultancy Services, and will allow Shreyas and his mother to stay in the UK as dependents. Mr Singh said he wanted to eventually apply for permanent residency. Leon Watson, secretary of Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas is a member, said the news was an ""enormous relief"" and that in 10 years' time, Shreyas could be ""a household name as England's first world champion"". ""Shreyas is a very nice, down-to-earth young man who has a big future ahead of him on the world stage hopefully representing England,"" he said. ""Our country badly needs someone like this, the next Nigel Short or Michael Adams, and we firmly believe Shreyas will do us proud."" A spokesman for the English Chess Federation said they are ""delighted"" by the decision to allow him to stay. Labour MPs Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, and Matthew Pennycook, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, wrote to the home secretary last week urging him to review the case. Ms Reeves said she was ""delighted"" for Shreyas and his family. ""This is also great news for the country, which would've lost one of its best and brightest had Shreyas been deported,"" she added.

"Captain Pogba scores early penalty to give Man Utd lead Shaw adds second - his first career goal Vardy heads in late on Leicester consolation Summer signing Fred makes Man Utd debut Tom Rostance And so we shall see you all there! I mean, I won't, I'm off to Carlisle v Northampton. But someone will be driving. Enjoy! There are six Premier League matches on Saturday which of course you can enjoy here at BBC Sport. Here's the list of games: James Maddison was very lively - he will obviously only get better as well as the season wears on. He had one chance and was denied by a very good save from David de Gea, the sort he makes look routine. ""I thought I'd scored,"" he said afterwards. ""Maybe I should have gone higher. Or lower."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Chris H:A year ago I watched James Maddison win a game for Norwich, then speak with incredible maturity afterwards. I said to my wife ""I'd put money on him captaining England one day"". Fuming with myself for not actually making that bet at the time. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Leicester City Leicester boss Claude Puel to BBC Sport:""It was a good game, a  good performance from my team. Certainly we lacked more energy in the second half. That's normal for the first game. ""We conceded an early goal, it was harsh. It was not a good result but it's a good performance. We gave our best, it was a difficult team against a great team. We deserved a different result. ""We showed good control, good football, a lot of chances. We had chances to score in the first half. It was more difficult in the second half without the energy. 
I am happy with the squad and the transfer window. We need to continue and build some good momentum. ""We deserved a minimum of a draw. ""It was tough for Harry Maguire, he gave his best and had a good game. I am happy with the performance to make this game in this condition, it's encouraging for the future."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United Speaking to Sky Sports, Luke Shaw said:""It was my first goal and that is all that was important, it doesn't matter how I scored. I was meant to come inside and I managed to get in front of him and put it in. It's the best feeling I have had in my career. I have worked really hard over the pre-season and I had a lot of time to reflect, and work on what I needed to. Even tonight, I know I can be better and that is what I want to keep showing the manager."" Asked if he could be permanent first-choice at United, Shaw said:""I don't want to speak too soon after one game but I want to be up there with the best left-backs in the world. I have the foundations to do that here with the manager and my team-mates at Manchester United. I want to play for England and I want to be involved again. ""I don't think I was playing as well as I could with my attacking capabilities last season, and that's what I'm known for."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Chrissy Mitch:Pereira was the best player on the pitch for Utd tonight. Looked calm and composed at the base of the three in midfield and sprayed some lovely balls about Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United full-back Luke Shaw registered his
     first senior goal in his 134th appearance in all competitions
     (67 games each for Southampton and Man Utd). #bbcfootball or 81111 on text  As a neutral, United deserved the win. Leicester not starting Vardy after a summer of him barely playing backfired as they too were good other than finishing. Be worried about Alexis Sanchez though, he's had a summer off, full pre-season and still looks a shadow of the player he was at Arsenal. Paul Man Utd 2-1 Leicester David MoyesFormer West Ham & Man Utd manager I would be looking for more from Alexis Sanchez. He made a great pass to put Romelu Lukaku in, but I would want more goals and more chances created from him. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has scored in
     11 Premier League games and ended on the winning side in all of them â a
     joint-record he shares with former Liverpool player Ryan Babel. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Conor McNamaraBBC Radio 5 live commentator I thought James Maddison played well tonight. We haven't seen him on this stage but he got stuck in, and once he settles into the Premier League, he is going to be one to watch because there aren't many British-born payers like him that have real flair. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United More from Jose Mourinho: ""It's important to win and play well, we played well in periods against a good team that invest more than us. We must get used to teams who have players of the same quality that we have. Every team is a good team, forget the name, forget the history, forget the shirt. ""It will be a difficult season for everybody, not just for us. I had my plans for many months and I find myself with the market closed in a situation I did not think I would be in. It's the last time I speak about it. It's over, the market is closed. ""That's football management. I think football is changing and managers should be called head coaches. We have to wait until the end of November to understand if we can fight for the title. ""I am very pleased for Luke Shaw. He made one mistake in 90 minutes, he was very good defensively. He had a good pre-season."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 live Harry Maguire was really solid at the back for Leicester. He came out during the warm-up and clapped the visiting fans to state his position at the club. I would like to see Jonny Evans play for the club, and maybe even see the pair together. I don't think you can criticise Leicester for their performance, United scored their goals with good play and sometimes you have to just tip your hat. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on Sky Sports:""Mr Scudamore must be happy, it's a good way to start the Premier League. A good match. A match where I needed six changes not three. I want to play Martial but I can't, Paul Pogba can't play 90, Fred the same. I need more changes. ""It was not easy to manage the game from the touchline. But I told the players we had good periods, lots of glimpses of the type of football we wanted to play. Leicester were strong in periods but we coped with that as a team. ""The team played as a team. In the second half I had Andreas Pereira and Fred with a yellow card, Paul was fantastic his contribution was amazing but the fuel was disappearing. We were in trouble. ""Martial in the last 20 minutes could have given us the second goal but I couldn't make that change. The players gave everything, they gave what they had. Everybody did that."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester David MoyesFormer West Ham & Man Utd manager I was surprised Paul Pogba came off because he was a big influence on the game at the time. Man United looked as though they had the game won at 2-0, but credit for Leicester for continuing to play and getting back into it.

I'm delighted for him that he got his goal. #bbcfootball Ricky:Was screaming ""not again!"" But tonight we survive and get the deserved 3 points.

"Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues The US has imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers over the continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. The evangelical from North Carolina has been held for nearly two years over alleged links to political groups. ""We believe he's a victim of unfair and unjust detention,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Turkey has said US demands for Mr Brunson's release are ""unacceptable"", adding it will respond to ""hostility"". ""We call on the US administration to row back from this wrong decision,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Without delay, there will be a response to this aggressive attitude that will not serve any purpose,"" it continued. The US Treasury Department later said,externalTurkey's Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu were targeted because they ""serve as leaders of Turkish government organizations responsible for implementing Turkey's serious human rights abuses"". Presidents Trump and Erdogan met at a Nato summit in Brussels last month By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent It is unprecedented for the US to hit a Nato ally with sanctions. The relationship has plunged to its lowest level in decades. But it is remarkable to think that in 2016, Turkey's government was gunning for a Donald Trump victory. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's disgraced former national security advisor, was paid to lobby for Turkey in Washington. There was confidence that presidents Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan could form a strongman partnership to reset ties. President Erdogan is known for lashing out at Western leaders. He hasn't taken kindly to being the one browbeaten by the US. Pro-government columnists are calling for the US military base here to be shut down. A crucial security partnership is at risk with two Nato allies at each other's throats. Meanwhile, Turks are suffering as the lira reaches new lows. Erdogan critics say he should have been sanctioned long ago - over mass arrests, human rights violations and buying a missile defence system from Russia. But now sanctions have come, the fear is of what two unpredictable leaders will do next. Speaking to reporters, Sarah Sanders said: ""We've seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong."" She added that the two Turkish ministers had both played ""leading roles"" in the arrest of the US pastor. ""As a result, any property or interest in property of both ministers within US jurisdiction is blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,"" she said.

Last week, President Trump warned Turkey it would face ""large sanctions"" if it did not release Mr Brunson immediately. Following Wednesday's announcement, the Turkish lira lost 1.6% of its value to fall to 5.0 against the US dollar. Mr Brunson is a long-term resident in Turkey. He lived with his wife and three children while working as the pastor of the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen. The authorities accuse him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a 2016 failed coup. Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen Erdogan's Turkey in depth Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. He was moved into house arrest last month for health reasons, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this was not enough. ""We have seen no credible evidence against Mr Brunson,"" Mr Pompeo tweeted at the time. Turkey's foreign ministry said it had shared ""necessary information"" with the US, but insisted the case should be left with its judiciary. Mr Brunson is one of 20 Americans who were charged after the coup two years ago, according to the New York Times. More than 50,000 people were arrested in Turkey in President Erdogan's huge post-coup crackdown. He blames Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempt, but Mr Gulen denies any involvement. Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. Mr Erdogan has indicated he would swap the pastor for ""the priest"" (Mr Gulen). US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK. The PKK - a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s - is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the US.

"The two men spoke on the sidelines of a Nato summit in Brussels last month President Donald Trump has doubled US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, as the precipitous fall of the Turkish lira accelerates. In a tweet,,externalMr Trump said the currency was weak against ""our very strong dollar"", adding that ""US relations with Turkey are not good at this time"". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech that the drop was part of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Turkey also warned it would retaliate against the US tariffs move. ""The United States should know that the only result that such sanctions and pressure will bring... will be harming our relationship as allies,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. The two Nato members are at odds on a range of issues - how to fight the Islamic State group, Ankara's plans to buy Russian missile defence systems and how to punish the alleged plotters of a failed coup in Turkey in 2016. Most recently, President Trump issued sanctions on top Turkish officials over the ongoing detention of a US pastor who is facing terror and espionage charges in Turkey. In the past 24 hours, the lira has lost around 20% of its value. It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? In a televised speech on Friday, President Erdogan called on citizens to exchange foreign currency and gold for lira, calling it an ""economic war"". ""This is a domestic and national struggle,"" he said, as the lira continued to fall. Mr Erdogan addressed the currency decline earlier on Friday In a veiled attack on the US he added: ""Some countries have engaged in behaviour that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice."" ""Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After he spoke, Mr Trump tweeted that aluminium tariffs ""with respect to Turkey"" would be raised to 20% and steel to 50%. The reaction from global currency markets to the rift caused the euro to slump to a 13-month low and pushed the dollar to a one-year high. Turks in Ankara examine the fluctuating exchange rate at a currency exchange shop The Turkish trade ministry responded that the additional tariffs were against the rules of the World Trade Organization. ""Turkey expects other member countries to abide by international rules,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that the US remained an important trade partner. Analysis by Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul It has been a dramatic day in Turkey but the Turkish government has put on a brave face. President Erdogan said: ""If they have dollars, we have our people, we have our right and we have Allah"" - rhetoric that goes down well with his supporters but not necessarily with international markets. Some will adhere his call to exchange their dollars, euros or gold for Turkish lira but many others have started feeling the squeeze. Interest rate hikes, which Mr Erdogan sees as the mother of all evils, are not very likely to happen. President Erdogan may seek help from the IMF, following the example of Argentina, but that is not likely either as it would have strings attached, and would be frowned upon in Turkey. There is a feeling that the quickest and most efficient step could be to ease the tensions with Washington. Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the Kremlin said the two leaders had discussed economic and trade ties. Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues Officials from Mr Erdogan's office said the two men had ""expressed pleasure"" that relations between Turkey and Russia were progressing ""positively"" amid joint defence and energy projects. Friday's developments are the latest manifestation of growing differences between the two sides on a number of issues. Earlier this month, theWhite House hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctionsover the country's ongoing detention of an American pastor. Turkey is accusing Andrew Brunson - who operates a small church in Izmir - of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the failed coup. He had been held in prison for almost two years, but was recently moved to house arrest due to health issues. Turkish carpet-makers dry out their wares American evangelicals have rallied to his cause, triggering the recent reaction from the Trump White House. Turkish officials have been in Washington this week for talks on his release but these seemed to fall apart in recent days. Last month, Mr Trump took to Twitter to threaten sanctions on Turkey if Mr Brunson was not released. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US has also been refusing to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and former Erdogan ally who has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania. Turkey accuses him of leading the attempted ""Gulenist"" coup. In addition, Turkish politicians are furious at American military support for Kurdish militia fighting the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria. Mr Trump's rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has also been a point of contention between the two nations. Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen Half of Turkey's oil imports come from Iran. Therefore the re-imposition of US sanctions against Iran has been seen by economists as likely to harm the Turkish economy. Then there is the Incirlik Air Base, which Nato has used extensively in the fight against IS. There has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close the base, and last week a group of pro-government Turkish lawyers filed charges against US soldiers stationed there. They request that a judge temporarily block all flights out of the base, and that arrest warrants be issued for the group of American officers, who they claim played a role in the coup attempt.

"After losing its battle to stay afloat, department store chain House of Fraser has been snapped up by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. The move came within hours of the retailer's announcement that it was appointing administrators. But it is unclear how much of the business will survive. It's a worrying time for House of Fraser's 17,500 employees, including 11,500 concession staff. So what went wrong for the retailer? New technology has had a disruptive influence on the High Street in general, with digital retailers such as Amazon dealing a savage blow to traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. But House of Fraser was slow to grasp the extent of the change, failing to respond quickly enough with its own internet offer. As far back as 2004,,externalthe chain was being described by the Interactive Media in Retail Group, a trade body, as one of the ""online laggards"" that ""failed to embrace internet trading opportunities"". It wasn't until last year that it announced a major upgrade of its online platform. By then, sales through the internet had grown to 20% of its business. House of Fraser bought by Sports Direct Why we no longer love dept stores The story of the House of Fraser Which High Street shops are opening and closing? However, the Â£25m that it spent on its digital revamp was just half the amount that online retailer Asos invested in technology in the same year. Meanwhile, John Lewis outstripped them both with a whopping Â£500m investment in e-commerce. Despite the rise of the internet, traditional department stores are not automatically doomed. But people do need a reason to visit them, whether physically or virtually. Over the years, House of Fraser has gobbled up lots of smaller department store concerns, such as Army & Navy, Dickins & Jones and DH Evans. In the process, it did a lot to kill off the diversity of High Streets up and down the UK, while failing to replace those defunct brands with a distinctive identity of its own. As a result, the average House of Fraser store was just that - average. With no unique selling point of its own, it lacked the pulling power it needed to fend off rivals. Worse still, a lot of the goods sold within were not even House of Fraser's: they were being hawked by more than 600 third-party concession owners. The chain's own brand was taking a back seat. When it embarked on its rescue plan, House of Fraser had 59 department stores in the UK. That's broadly comparable with John Lewis and a lot less than Debenhams, but those two retailers have been more successful than House of Fraser at reinventing themselves and staying relevant in a crowded marketplace. Retail analysts reckon the chain should have slimmed down its portfolio a long time ago. Instead, it spent years acquiring more stores, often with expensive legacy lease arrangements. The last 15 years have been a turbulent era for the group: it changed hands twice and became a bid target a number of times. Amid all the takeovers and fears of takeovers, it was never clear what House of Fraser's long-term strategy was. The uncertainty began in 2003, when Scottish billionaire Tom Hunter launched an unsuccessful hostile bid. Other attempted takeovers ensued until in 2006, it was sold to a consortium led by Iceland's Baugur for Â£351m. There was yet more takeover talk in 2013, this time with French department store Galeries Lafayette. A year later, House of Fraser was sold to Chinese department store group Nanjing Xinjiekou, part of Sanpower, in a deal valued at about Â£480m. More recently, there's been much talk of a ""revolving door"" syndrome blighting the chain's management. When current chief executive Alex Williamson was hired in July last year after nine years at sporting firm Goodwood, his lack of retail experience raised eyebrows. Mr Williamson's predecessor, Nigel Oddy, had been in the job for less than two years when he resigned in November 2016, leaving the firm rudderless just before the crucial Christmas trading period. It was hoped that the company would be rescued by another Chinese company, C.banner, owner of toy store Hamleys. But the deal fell through at the last minute, sealing House of Fraser's fate. As it turned out, C.banner itself was not robust enough to save the ageing High Street stalwart. The Hong Kong-listed firm had planned to fund the deal by issuing new shares. But when its share price fell 70% in two months, it was forced to pull the share placing, which it said had become ""impracticable and inadvisable"". As a result, there was nothing to stop House of Fraser falling into administration, with Mike Ashley ultimately stepping in to buy up the chain.

"Luxury yachts off the Lycian coast in southern Turkey Turkey's currency, the lira, has hit record lows, creating a headache for the country's president and pushing up prices on everyday items. But there is one area reaping the benefits: tourism. Bookings to Turkey have gone up in recent months - although the exact cause is, of course, hard to say. A favourable exchange rate though can't have harmed the situation: on Friday, the US dollar would buy almost six Turkish lira; at the end of January, it would have got you less than four. So what has happened to send the lira on a downward spiral and should more tourists take advantage? The value of Turkey's currency has nosedived since January and has lost more than 34% of its value against the dollar. It hit a record low on Thursday evening, reaching 6.30 to the dollar, although it has since recovered slightly. The stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year, according to Andrew Walker, the BBC World Service economics correspondent. Meanwhile, inflation in Turkey has hit 15%. A combination of factors, according to experts, have led to fears the country is sliding into an economic crisis. For a start, investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, as the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. Then there are Turkey's worsening relations with the US.Donald Trump's administration hit its justice and interior ministers with sanctionslast week, a reaction to the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has has been held for nearly two years over alleged links to political groups. The US dealt Turkey and the lira a further blow in a tweet on Friday, in whichMr Trump said he had approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium,external. The Celsius Library in the Aegean region Nafez Zouk, an economist at Oxford Economics, told the BBC's Today programme earlier this week that these problems were further compounded by a ""political set-up which is unconducive to proper economic management"". Indeed, much of the recent concern has been fuelled by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's economic policy. In many nations, including the US and EU states, the central bank is independent of government and no one can tell it what to do with interest rates. This means it can keep control of inflation by raising them when necessary. Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? US hits Turkey with sanctions over jailed pastor How powerful will President Erdogan be? But in Turkey, Mr Erdogan has made sure he controls the reins. Early last month, he claimed the exclusive power to appoint the bankers that set interest rates - and to cement his control he has put his son-in-law in charge of economic policy. And if he is flustered by the current situation, he isn't showing it. On Thursday, he urged supporters not to worry, saying that while overseas investors had dollars, Turks had Allah. If the right policies were applied. But while Mr Erdogan - who vowed Turkey would win the ""economic war"" - favours lowering borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion, others would rather see interest rates rise. A view over the old town of Kaleici, Antalya But Mr Erdogan is famously averse to interest rate rises, and there are fears he may be pressuring the central bank not to act. Meanwhile, ING economist Carsten Brzeski told news agency Reuters ""some kind of... involvement"" by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was ""getting closer"". Solving Turkey's tensions with the US would also likely go some way to quell nerves. However, the Financial Times points toanalysts who suggest Turkey will probably just wait it out.,external Well, if you want azure seas, ancient temples and a holiday which most likely costs less than it did last year, then yes. Eagle-eyed Brits have already figured this out, it seems, with travel agents reporting a rise in bookings. A view across Istanbul Holiday company Thomas Cook has seen a 63% rise in bookings to Turkey,,externalwhile TUI said it was their third most popular destination meaning it was ""well and truly back on the map as a top summer holiday location"". However, the UK Foreign Office still recommends against all but essential travel to a number of regions, mainly along the border with Syria, and says not to travel within 10km (six miles) of the border at all, due to the ongoing Syrian war. The US, meanwhile, rates Turkey at level three, urging people to reconsider travel to the region. See more stories and videos like this Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis?

"The impressive interior of the flagship House of Fraser store in Glasgow It all began with one shop in the centre of Glasgow almost 170 years ago but at its height it became a retail empire with more than 100 department stores, including one of the most famous in the world. Luxury London store Harrods was added to the House of Fraser empire in 1959, when Hugh Fraser III outbid Debenhams to take control of the iconic name. Around the same time, Fraser also acquired other big names in major UK cities such as Kendals in Manchester and Rackhams in Birmingham. Frasers landmark store in Glasgow, where it all began On his death in 1966, his son, also called Hugh, continued its expansion by buying out more than 50 companies. But the playboy retailer's lifestyle finally caught up with him in the late 1970s when he was found to have been selling stocks to fund his gambling addiction. In 1985, the Fraser dynasty came to an end as the group fell into the hands of Mohamed Al Fayed. Hugh Fraser III at the time of his take over of Harrods in 1959 Thirty years later the House of Fraser is a still a huge name in British retail, with 59 stores in high streets and shopping malls across the UK and Ireland. However, it entered administration on Friday morning after talks between the retailer and its creditors failed to reach an agreement. It was later announced that Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has agreed to buy the House of Fraser department store chain for Â£90m. Like many of the UK's tradition retail giants it has struggled with changing consumer habits, such as the rise of online shopping, and the cost of a huge bricks and mortar business. House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Which shops are opening and closing? Why we no longer love department stores? It has been bought and sold by a number of companies over the decades and the group lost Harrods when Fayed sold House of Fraser in 1994 but retained the landmark Knightsbridge store. Harrods, one of the most famous department stores in the world, was part of the group for more than 30 years Its previous owners had planned to close stores as they looked to turn around the fortunes of the department store chain, which has fallen on hard times. But months of negotiations on its future concluded with a statement that said talks with investors and creditors had ""not concluded in a solvent solution"". During its expansion in the early part of the 20th Century, the group had owned Scottish stores with long pedigrees such as Arnotts, which could be found from Ayr to Fraserburgh, and Bairds, which was in several Lanarkshire towns. Jenners in Edinburgh has been owned by House of Fraser since 2005 It also owned Falconers in Aberdeen and Benzie and Miller's in Inverness and Elgin. Almost all of these have closed in the past 20 years and House of Fraser now has just four outlets in Scotland. For 13 years it has owned Jenners, at the east end of Princes Street in Edinburgh. Sir Hugh Fraser took over House of Fraser in 1966 but sold the family firm in the 1980s But there is also a Frasers at the west end of Princes Street, which was formerly known as Binns. It had been earmarked as one of the stores that would be closed as part of the failed rescue package. Jenners also has an outlet at Lomond Shores at the south end of Loch Lomond but the most profitable House of Fraser store is the one where it all started, on Glasgow's Buchanan Street. The store in Bristol is one of more than 50 around the UK On 17 October 1849, James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened the store on a site that was a former mansion house belonging to Andrew Buchanan, one of Glasgow's most successful merchants. In its early days Arthur & Fraser was very much a drapery and haberdashery business. The partnership between Arthur, the conservative accountant, and Fraser, the charming salesman, was dissolved in 1865, with Fraser forming a new partnership with Alexander McLaren. The House of Fraser store in London's Oxford Street As business prospered, it eventually took over the magnificent building created in 1885 by another much-loved store, Wylie & Lochhead. To this day, its elaborate interior makes shopping there a memorable occasion. The group's main period of expansion began in the 1920s when Hugh Fraser III became managing director at the age of just 21. Hugh, who later was made Lord Fraser of Allander, kicked off by buying regional store groups Arnott & Co and Robert Simpson & Sons. In 1948, he renamed the business House Of Fraser and floated it on the London Stock Exchange. He also bought non-retail businesses including the Glasgow Herald newspaper. The group's growth continued after Lord Fraser's death in 1966 and by the end of the 70s it had 112 stores and many other businesses. In the early 90s while it was still owned by Fayed, the House of Fraser opened big new stores in out-of-town shopping centres such as Meadowhall in Sheffield and the Lakeside in Essex. But under new ownership, a reorganisation led to the closure or selling off of a number of branches. Further stores, including many in Scotland, went in the early 2000s. Despite the acquisition of other stores, such as Jenners in Edinburgh in 2005, and further large store openings, the business has struggled to keep up with changing demands. In 2014, it was bought by a Chinese conglomerate. Another potential new owner, C.banner International, had agreed to buy a majority stake, with a ""significant capital injection"" but only if more than half the stores were closed and debt was restructured. It pulled out of that agreement two weeks ago leading to the House of Fraser group entering administration. It will now be up to Mike Ashley what happens next. It is all a long way from a Victorian drapers in the centre of Glasgow.

"Financial markets are uneasy about President Erdogan's views on economic policy Is Turkey heading for an economic and financial crisis? Recent developments in the country's financial markets have certainly been alarming. The Turkish currency, the lira, has lost about 30% of its value against the US dollar since the New Year. The stock market has fallen 17%, or if you measure it in dollars as some foreign investors would do, the decline is 40% Another measure often watched in the markets is government borrowing costs. Borrowing for 10 years in its own currency now costs 18% a year. Even borrowing in dollars is expensive for Turkey at a cost of around 7%. So what is going on? Turkey has a deficit in its international trade. It imports more than it exports. Or to put it another way, it spends more than it earns. That deficit has to be financed, either by foreign investment or by borrowing. In itself that is neither unusual nor dangerous. But Turkey's deficit is quite large at 5.5% of national income, or GDP, last year. There are two features of Turkey's foreign debt that also increase its vulnerability. First, it has a high level of debt due for repayment in the near future - loans that have to be repaid and the money borrowed anew. To use the language of the financial markets, the debt has to be refinanced. Credit rating agency Fitch estimates that Turkey's total financing needs this year will be almost $230bn. Second, many Turkish companies have borrowed in foreign currency. Those loans become more expensive to repay if the value of the national currency declines - which it has. The currency weakness also aggravates Turkey's persistent inflation problem. The weaker lira makes imports more expensive. The central bank has an inflation target of 5%. A year ago, inflation was well above that, at about 10%. Since then the situation has deteriorated further with prices now rising at an annual rate of about 15%. Financial market investors are also very uneasy about President Erdogan's views on economic policy and the pressure he is seen as exerting on the country's central bank. There is an obvious policy option open to a central bank that wants to bear down on inflation - raising interest rates. That can curb inflation in two ways. It can weaken demand at home, and by increasing financial returns in Turkey encourage investors to buy lira - which strengthens the currency and reduces the cost of imports. Turkey's central bank has taken several such moves, but without any lasting impact on the problem. What bothers the markets is the president's well known - and most economists would say, ill-informed - opposition to higher rates. He has described himself as the enemy of interest rates. The result is that investors are not convinced that the central bank will do what is needed to stabilise the currency and bring inflation under control. In turn, that makes them more wary about the outlook for Turkish financial assets. Confidence has been further undermined by Turkey's strained relations with the United States. Turkey has detained an American evangelical pastor and there are differences over the approach to Syria. In addition, the US is reviewing Turkey's eligibility for a programme that gives many exports from developing countries duty-free access to the US market. Turkey is also at risk from developments in the US. The Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, which encourages investors to pull money out of emerging markets. The impact has been moderate, but it is potential aggravating factor for countries such as Turkey with other vulnerabilities. In some respects the recent performance of the Turkish economy looks reasonable. It has grown every year this century apart from 2001 (the country's last economic crisis when it received an IMF bailout) and 2009 (in the aftermath of the global financial crisis). In some years growth has been very strong. Unemployment is on the high side - the most recent figure is 9.9% - but it has been relatively stable. One important difference compared with the country's crisis at the beginning of the century is that there is now no exchange rate target, unlike in 2001. Back then, the pressure in the currency markets forced Turkey to abandon the targets. This time there is no currency peg so the lira has simply been allowed to depreciate. That said, credit rating agency Moody's says that economic growth has been boosted to unsustainable levels by spending and tax policies. Policies for long-term growth have been sidelined, the agency says, given the focus on election cycles. Fitch warns that the risk of a hard landing for the economy, meaning a sharp slowdown or even a recession, has increased.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties The Saudi-led military coalition has announced it will investigate an air strike in Yemen which killed at least 29 children. On its Twitter feed, Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV quoted a senior official who said the coalition was probing ""collateral damage"" from the strike. Forces struck a bus in Dahyan in the rebel-held province of Saada. The coalition backs Yemen's government against the Houthi rebels and initially deemed its actions ""legitimate"". But now the coalition intends to investigate the strike, with Al-Arabiya TV quoting the official as saying they will ""bring the perpetrators to account and compensate the victims"". Child graves have been dug The Houthi-affiliated health ministry now says the death toll from the strike has risen to 51 in total, including 40 children, with a further 79 injured. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an ""independent and prompt investigation"",externalinto the strike, his spokesperson said. UK Foreign Office ministerAlistair Burt also stated the need for a ""transparent investigation"",external, posting on Twitter that he was ""deeply concerned"" by the attack. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Council, tweeted that he was prepared to co-operate with an international inquiry. The bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,external, transporting local civilians, including many schoolchildren, Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press news agency. The children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink, the charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The Houthi health ministry says at least 40 children were killed in the attack Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom?

This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"Captain Pogba scores early penalty to give Man Utd lead Shaw adds second - his first career goal Vardy heads in late on Leicester consolation Summer signing Fred makes Man Utd debut Tom Rostance And so we shall see you all there! I mean, I won't, I'm off to Carlisle v Northampton. But someone will be driving. Enjoy! There are six Premier League matches on Saturday which of course you can enjoy here at BBC Sport. Here's the list of games: James Maddison was very lively - he will obviously only get better as well as the season wears on. He had one chance and was denied by a very good save from David de Gea, the sort he makes look routine. ""I thought I'd scored,"" he said afterwards. ""Maybe I should have gone higher. Or lower."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Chris H:A year ago I watched James Maddison win a game for Norwich, then speak with incredible maturity afterwards. I said to my wife ""I'd put money on him captaining England one day"". Fuming with myself for not actually making that bet at the time. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Leicester City Leicester boss Claude Puel to BBC Sport:""It was a good game, a  good performance from my team. Certainly we lacked more energy in the second half. That's normal for the first game. ""We conceded an early goal, it was harsh. It was not a good result but it's a good performance. We gave our best, it was a difficult team against a great team. We deserved a different result. ""We showed good control, good football, a lot of chances. We had chances to score in the first half. It was more difficult in the second half without the energy. 
I am happy with the squad and the transfer window. We need to continue and build some good momentum. ""We deserved a minimum of a draw. ""It was tough for Harry Maguire, he gave his best and had a good game. I am happy with the performance to make this game in this condition, it's encouraging for the future."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United Speaking to Sky Sports, Luke Shaw said:""It was my first goal and that is all that was important, it doesn't matter how I scored. I was meant to come inside and I managed to get in front of him and put it in. It's the best feeling I have had in my career. I have worked really hard over the pre-season and I had a lot of time to reflect, and work on what I needed to. Even tonight, I know I can be better and that is what I want to keep showing the manager."" Asked if he could be permanent first-choice at United, Shaw said:""I don't want to speak too soon after one game but I want to be up there with the best left-backs in the world. I have the foundations to do that here with the manager and my team-mates at Manchester United. I want to play for England and I want to be involved again. ""I don't think I was playing as well as I could with my attacking capabilities last season, and that's what I'm known for."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Chrissy Mitch:Pereira was the best player on the pitch for Utd tonight. Looked calm and composed at the base of the three in midfield and sprayed some lovely balls about Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United full-back Luke Shaw registered his
     first senior goal in his 134th appearance in all competitions
     (67 games each for Southampton and Man Utd). #bbcfootball or 81111 on text  As a neutral, United deserved the win. Leicester not starting Vardy after a summer of him barely playing backfired as they too were good other than finishing. Be worried about Alexis Sanchez though, he's had a summer off, full pre-season and still looks a shadow of the player he was at Arsenal. Paul Man Utd 2-1 Leicester David MoyesFormer West Ham & Man Utd manager I would be looking for more from Alexis Sanchez. He made a great pass to put Romelu Lukaku in, but I would want more goals and more chances created from him. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has scored in
     11 Premier League games and ended on the winning side in all of them â a
     joint-record he shares with former Liverpool player Ryan Babel. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Conor McNamaraBBC Radio 5 live commentator I thought James Maddison played well tonight. We haven't seen him on this stage but he got stuck in, and once he settles into the Premier League, he is going to be one to watch because there aren't many British-born payers like him that have real flair. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United More from Jose Mourinho: ""It's important to win and play well, we played well in periods against a good team that invest more than us. We must get used to teams who have players of the same quality that we have. Every team is a good team, forget the name, forget the history, forget the shirt. ""It will be a difficult season for everybody, not just for us. I had my plans for many months and I find myself with the market closed in a situation I did not think I would be in. It's the last time I speak about it. It's over, the market is closed. ""That's football management. I think football is changing and managers should be called head coaches. We have to wait until the end of November to understand if we can fight for the title. ""I am very pleased for Luke Shaw. He made one mistake in 90 minutes, he was very good defensively. He had a good pre-season."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 live Harry Maguire was really solid at the back for Leicester. He came out during the warm-up and clapped the visiting fans to state his position at the club. I would like to see Jonny Evans play for the club, and maybe even see the pair together. I don't think you can criticise Leicester for their performance, United scored their goals with good play and sometimes you have to just tip your hat. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on Sky Sports:""Mr Scudamore must be happy, it's a good way to start the Premier League. A good match. A match where I needed six changes not three. I want to play Martial but I can't, Paul Pogba can't play 90, Fred the same. I need more changes. ""It was not easy to manage the game from the touchline. But I told the players we had good periods, lots of glimpses of the type of football we wanted to play. Leicester were strong in periods but we coped with that as a team. ""The team played as a team. In the second half I had Andreas Pereira and Fred with a yellow card, Paul was fantastic his contribution was amazing but the fuel was disappearing. We were in trouble. ""Martial in the last 20 minutes could have given us the second goal but I couldn't make that change. The players gave everything, they gave what they had. Everybody did that."" Man Utd 2-1 Leicester David MoyesFormer West Ham & Man Utd manager I was surprised Paul Pogba came off because he was a big influence on the game at the time. Man United looked as though they had the game won at 2-0, but credit for Leicester for continuing to play and getting back into it. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Dion DublinEx-Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 live I think Luke Shaw is the best left-back Man United have got, when he is fit and flying. I'm delighted for him that he got his goal. #bbcfootball Ricky:Was screaming ""not again!"" But tonight we survive and get the deserved 3 points. United off the mark, looked so comfortable at 2-0; but fell asleep, Jose won't be happy with that attitude Lloyd:Shaw-shanks Redemption James:United bring Fellaini on - United concede. Man Utd 2-1 Leicester Manchester United Manchester United captain Paul Pogba on Sky Sports:""We should start the Premier League with a win and we did. I didn't have any pre-season games, I came back on Monday so it was very hard for the legs. We played very well, the performance was OK. We want to go up. ""We don't have a penalty taker, it's how we feel and I decided to take it. Maybe on the next game I leave it to Alexis. ""Fred is a very good player, he will help us. I feel comfortable with him. ""Winning the World Cup is in the past. I like challenges, I want to progress and win more trophies.""  Man Utd 2-1 Leicester David MoyesFormer West Ham & Man Utd manager I thought Leicester played well in the first half but they gave the ball away in the second period and allowed Manchester United to attack.

"Ch Supt Jeff Moore said organisations need to work together to prevent people using monkey dust Use of a drug which can put users in a violent, paranoid state with ""superhuman strength"" is at epidemic levels, emergency workers have warned. Dubbed Monkey Dust, the ""highly unpredictable"" substance has caused people to jump off buildings and run into traffic, police said. Stoke-on-Trent, resembled a scene from a zombie film thanks to the drug, one paramedic told the BBC. Staffordshire Police said it was working on ways to tackle supply. The force said it had 950 reports in three months - roughly 10 a day - related to Monkey Dust. Ch Supt Jeff Moore said those under the influence of Monkey Dust were ""difficult to deal with"" and posed ""a risk not just to other people but to themselves as well"".

""The effect on the patient can vary considerably; our staff often treat legal high users who have suffered seizures, heart attacks and strokes,"" a spokesman said. ""Some patients are left with long-term illnesses whilst others never wake up. ""Because it is impossible to tell what substances are used within the drugs, it can make it extremely difficult for our staff to provide treatment."" Paramedic Steven Rust said: ""There is no regular pattern of behaviour and there is a psychosis of being paranoid, mixed in with all that and superhuman strength in some cases, and they have no fear of doing anything. ""There was a comment from a colleague who said he drove through Stoke-on-Trent a couple of nights ago and it was like a scene from the Night of the Living Dead. ""It is not a problem, it is already an epidemic."" Public Health England says Monkey Dust is the street name for Methylenedioxy-Î±-pyrrolidinohexiophenone or MDPHP. It is a stimulant known as a cathinone and it is similar to another drug, MDPV or Methylenedioxypyrovalerone. The government classifies synthetic cathinones as Class B drugs Last month, neighbouring force West Mercia Policeissued its own warning after the deaths of two men,externalthought to be linked to Monkey Dust.

"The actor won an Oscar for his role in 2016 drama Manchester by the Sea Actor Casey Affleck has apologised for the ""unprofessional environment"" on the set of his 2010 film I'm Still Here. ""I behaved in a way, and I allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional, and I'm sorry,""he told the Associated Press,external. The Oscar winner was sued by two female crew members who accused him of sexual harassment while working on the mockumentary film, which he directed. Affleck denied the allegations and the lawsuits were settled out of court. Affleck settles harassment claim ""That I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret,"" he said. ""I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing, and I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't agree with everything, the way I was being described and the things that were said about me,"" Affleck said. ""But I wanted to try to make it right, and so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time."" Affleck was also a producer on I'm Still Here, in which actor Joaquin Phoenix was seen pretending to launch a musical alter-ego. He said that meant ""the buck had to stop"" with him and that he had ""to accept responsibility"" for what took place on the set. Affleck's accusers, producer Amanda White and director of photography Magdalena Gorka, alleged that they were repeatedly subjected to sexual innuendoes and unwanted advances. ""It was an unprofessional environment,"" Affleck said. ""And I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behaviour from other people and I wish that I hadn't, and I regret a lot of that."" Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence presented the best actress Oscar to Frances McDormand Affleck, the younger brother of Hollywood star Ben, also said that turning down a presenting role at this year's Oscars had been ""the right thing to do"". Having won the best actor award in 2017 for Manchester by the Sea, the 42-year-old had been expected to appear at this year's ceremony to present the best actress prize. Following his withdrawal, the statuette was instead presented to Frances McDormand by Jennifer Lawrence and Jodie Foster. ""Given everything that was going on in our culture at the moment... having two incredible women go present the best actress award felt like the right thing,"" he told AP's Lindsey Bahr. Affleck pulls out of 2018 Oscars In his first extensive interview since pulling out of this year's Oscars, Affleck addressed the concerns of the #MeToo movement and said he ""needed to keep his mouth shut and listen"". ""Women have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways,"" he said. ""No-one was really making too much of a fuss about it, myself included, until [there were] a few women with the kind of courage and wisdom to stand up and say, 'You know what? Enough is enough.'""

"The budget retailer Poundworld faces an uncertain future after falling into administration. Chains including House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and Mothercare, have announced they are closing branches. But what kinds of shops and leisure outlets are increasing and declining most across Britain? If you want to get a haircut or shave, go for a workout, drink a coffee or eat a pizza (either at home or in a restaurant), times are good. Outlets offering these services are among the fastest-growing consumer premises in Britain, according to a survey by the Local Data Company. But pubs, banks, travel agents, post offices and newsagents are becoming more of a rarity. High street crisis forces hundreds of closures Five things to do with empty retail space 10 high street stores of 1976 that have disappeared Despite overall sales rising considerably in May, British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has warned that conditions remain ""extremely challenging"" for shops, with margins tight and competition intense. So, here are the types of premises - selling goods and/or services - apparently doing best at the moment (the net increase shows how many more premises opened than closed during the year): The Office for National Statistics says British online sales increased to 17.3% of all retailing in the year to April, from 16.1% the previous year. So, it's little surprise that businesses providing services and goods that would be hard or impossible to supply over the internet - beauty treatments, tattooing, cups of coffee, and so on - have taken over hundreds of premises. Retailers, on the other hand, face ""significant head winds"" - includingincreases in the National Living Wageand rising costs in sourcing goods, with the decline in value of the pound - says Richard Lim, chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. Meanwhile, consumers are looking for ""low costs and convenience"", leading them to online shopping for many goods, a trend, he says, that will ""only accelerate"", potentially damaging High Streets. Here are the retail/service sectors that lost the most premises last year (the net decrease shows how many more closed than opened): The pubs figure roughly tallies with Campaign for Real Ale data suggesting they are closing at the rate of two a day. It blames high tax rates on alcohol, saying they cause more people to drink at home. But the Office for National Statistics also reports theproportion of the population who drink has shrunk.,external And a parliamentary report earlier this year described bank closures as""seemingly remorseless"",external, saying decreased use of cheques and more payments being made electronically had played their part. Likewise, sales of actual physical newspapers have fallen, as has the number of people smoking, hitting newsagents. And the Association of British Travel Agents found that83% of people used websites to book breaks last year,external- up from 76% in 2016. Shops and leisure operators are dealing with an ""unprecedented"" range of challenges, including internet competition, business rate increases and lifestyle changes, says Mr Lim. ""The question,"" he adds, ""is how the strongest brands deal with what's happening.""

"Ryanair pilots are striking in five European countries, forcing the cancellation of a sixth of the firm's flights during the holiday season peak. The 24-hour walk-out involves staff in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers are understood to have been told of cancellations on 400 flights. The action is the largest in a series of strikes over pay and conditions. Ryanair says it has made every effort to resolve the dispute. The company says 85% of its scheduled flights will operate as normal on Saturday and the majority of customers affected have been given places on other Ryanair flights. The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, averted widespread strikes before Christmas byagreeing to recognise unions for the first timein its 30-year history. But there have been protests ever since over the negotiating of collective labour agreements. About 300 Ryanair flights were cancelled in July when cabin crews in Belgium, Portugal and Spain went on strike for 48 hours. Emily Dutton was due to fly to Gothenburg in Sweden for a wedding, with her boyfriend Craig. But the ""once in a lifetime experience"" of being at her best friend Justine's wedding seems impossible now, after Ryanair cancelled her flight with two days' notice. The 27-year-old project manager from Letchworth was due to fly from Stansted Airport, and was told there were no alternative flights for the rest of the day. Emily Dutton and her boyfriend Craig were due to fly to Gothenburg for a best friend's wedding ""The only reason I found this out was through a reminder email about checking in being sent to my email account. ""Had I not checked, I would have arrived at the airport only to find my flight being cancelled. ""I spent about four hours [yesterday] calling them and trying to find my own travel options to see how to get to Sweden. ""They couldn't find us any alternative flights until Sunday. Great news, the wedding is on Saturday so that was absolutely no use."" She tried to find any other flights to Sweden from other UK airports, and even asked if she could fly to Copenhagen in Denmark, and get a train to Gothenburg instead. ""My only options were to get a refund or to go down the route - which I have done - to claim compensation."" The airline in recent days announced the cancellations of 250 flights in and out Germany, 104 to and from Belgium and another 42 affecting Sweden and Ireland. A Dutch court on Thursday evening rejected a case from Ryanair seeking to block pilots in the Netherlands from joining the strike, affecting about 22 flights. But at about the same time Ryanair issued a statement saying there would be no cancellations. The unions want the contracts of Ryanair employees to be governed by the laws of the nation where they are based, not by Irish legislation. Ryanair has described the strike action as ""regrettable and unjustified"", claiming its pilots are paid more than other budget airlines. It said it has taken every step to minimise the disruption,,externaladding: ""The majority of customers affected have already been re-accommodated on another Ryanair flight."" The airline hasmaintained that strikes qualify as ""extraordinary circumstances""and are therefore exempt from EU compensation rules. But the Civil Aviation Authority says that, in the case of strikes by an airline's employees, the airline is responsible for compensation. Consumer group Which? said affected passengers should lodge a claim with the airline. Which? travel editor Rory Boland said the dispute resolution service used by Ryanair had already confirmed it would uphold a previous European ruling that crew strikes are not usually considered ""extraordinary circumstances"".

"Emergency vehicles pictured near the scene in Fredericton, New Brunswick Canadian police say a suspect is in custody after at least four people - two of them police officers - were killed in a shooting in the eastern city of Fredericton, New Brunswick. The slain officers were identified as Sarah Burns and Robb Costello, but the civilians - a man and a woman - have not been named. The officers were responding to reports of shots fired when they were killed, officials told media. Police have not mentioned a motive. ""Protecting us today, they gave their lives,"" Fredericton mayor Mike O'Brien told the media during a press conference. ""We will get through this together but now my thoughts turn to the families of the victims."" Burns, 43, leaves behind a husband and three children, while Costello, 45, is survived by his partner and four children. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Awful news coming out of Fredericton,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this morning's shooting. We're following the situation closely."" Fredericton is the capital of New Brunswick province and home to around 56,000 people. It is rare in Canada for police officers to be killed in the line of duty. Between 1961 and 2009, a total of 133 police were killed, and just five in the province of New Brunswick. In 2014 24-year-old Justin Bourque shot five RCMP officers in the province, killing three. The shooting spree led to a28-hour manhunt, and shocked the nation. In the aftermath, the RCMP was charged with labour-code violations alleging police officers had not been adequately armed and protected for the situation. Gun laws are more stringent in Canada than in the US, but the number of shootings has nonetheless risen in recent years. Does Canada have a gun problem?

"Ch Supt Jeff Moore said organisations need to work together to prevent people using monkey dust Use of a drug which can put users in a violent, paranoid state with ""superhuman strength"" is at epidemic levels, emergency workers have warned. Dubbed Monkey Dust, the ""highly unpredictable"" substance has caused people to jump off buildings and run into traffic, police said. Stoke-on-Trent, resembled a scene from a zombie film thanks to the drug, one paramedic told the BBC. Staffordshire Police said it was working on ways to tackle supply. The force said it had 950 reports in three months - roughly 10 a day - related to Monkey Dust. Ch Supt Jeff Moore said those under the influence of Monkey Dust were ""difficult to deal with"" and posed ""a risk not just to other people but to themselves as well"". ""We have seen cases where we've got people running into traffic, we've seen cases where we've got people climbing onto buildings,"" he said. ""It is that unpredictability that is causing that concern."" Midlands Live: Firefighters continue to tackle huge fire at nature reserve; Woman pulls elderly man from house fire West Midlands Ambulance Service said it has also seen a monthly increase in call-outs since December. ""The effect on the patient can vary considerably; our staff often treat legal high users who have suffered seizures, heart attacks and strokes,"" a spokesman said. ""Some patients are left with long-term illnesses whilst others never wake up. ""Because it is impossible to tell what substances are used within the drugs, it can make it extremely difficult for our staff to provide treatment."" Paramedic Steven Rust said: ""There is no regular pattern of behaviour and there is a psychosis of being paranoid, mixed in with all that and superhuman strength in some cases, and they have no fear of doing anything. ""There was a comment from a colleague who said he drove through Stoke-on-Trent a couple of nights ago and it was like a scene from the Night of the Living Dead. ""It is not a problem, it is already an epidemic."" Public Health England says Monkey Dust is the street name for Methylenedioxy-Î±-pyrrolidinohexiophenone or MDPHP. It is a stimulant known as a cathinone and it is similar to another drug, MDPV or Methylenedioxypyrovalerone. The government classifies synthetic cathinones as Class B drugs Last month, neighbouring force West Mercia Policeissued its own warning after the deaths of two men,externalthought to be linked to Monkey Dust.

Debbie Moores, a service manager for One Recovery North Staffordshire, said: ""It is of epidemic proportions in Stoke-on-Trent but it is bleeding more into our area. She said: ""The impact on agencies is huge and it takes us away from what we are supposed to be doing.

"Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK Bowel cancer screening in England is to start earlier, at age 50, Public Health England has announced. It said evidence showed that screening people at a younger age would allow more bowel cancers to be picked up at an earlier stage. Currently, men and women in England are first invited for screening at the age of 60 and sent a home testing kit. The change brings England in line with Scotland where bowel screening is automatically offered from 50. An independent committee of screening experts recently recommended that bowel cancer screening in England should begin 10 years earlier than it does now. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has now agreed to the change, and NHS England and Public Health England are deciding how the plan will be rolled out. A new, improved test, called a faecal immunochemical home test kit or FIT, is being rolled out to everyone age 60 and over in the autumn. In the future, the plan is to send this more accurate test to everyone in England from the age of 50. The current home test kits are being improved and will be sent out to everyone from age 50 At present in England, men and women are first invited for bowel cancer screening at 60 and sent a home test kit every two years up to the age of 74. Using the kit, you collect small samples of your poo and post them to a lab which then checks them for tiny amounts of blood, which could be caused by cancer. In some areas - around half the country - a one-off bowel scope test is also offered at the age of 55. This involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera being inserted into the bowel to look for polyps which can turn cancerous. Only those who have an abnormal result after screening will be offered a colonoscopy. Prof Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said: ""The risk of bowel cancer rises steeply from around age 50-54 and rates are significantly higher among males than females. ""Starting screening 10 years earlier at 50 will help spot more abnormalities at an early stage that could develop into bowel cancer if not detected."" She added that the change would take time to implement. Steve Brine, public health minister, said: ""With the roll out of FIT as a new bowel screening test from the autumn - a much more convenient and reliable test - we have a real opportunity to reshape our bowel screening programme and potentially detect the stages of bowel cancer much earlier. ""We are now considering opportunities and taking expert advice on how a sustainable, optimal bowel cancer screening programme starting at age 50 can work in the future."" Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with 42,000 people diagnosed every year. More than 16,000 people die from the cancer annually in the UK. bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo a persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit unexplained weight loss extreme tiredness for no obvious reason a pain or lump in your tummy Cancer Research UK said it was delighted by the government's decision to lower the age bowel screening starts. Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: ""This will mean more cancers can be spotted earlier, saving lives. When bowel cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, 9 in 10 people survive but when it is detected in the late stages, survival falls to 1 in 10."" But she said the biggest challenge was to find enough staff to carry out diagnostic tests, such as colonoscopies, which more people will need when screening is extended.

"The one-week-old piglet is being hand-reared by the RSPCA and the man is awaiting a further court appearance A man who walked a piglet along a busy city street without a lead has admitted the offence in court. Thomas Murphy-Hankin, 26, was arrested on Prince of Wales Road, Norwich, on Wednesday. Officers said they arrived to find a dog - which bit one of them - and the pig, which was loose in the street. At Norwich Magistrates' Court, Mr Murphy-Hankin admitted a public order offence and a charge relating to the stray pig, but denied the dog was his. Police responded to reports the defendant, of no fixed address, was shouting abuse at members of the public at about 10:10 BST. Officers, who said they were ""lost for words"" at the porker's presence, charged him with a public order offence and ""having a pig untethered and loose on a public highway"", contrary toSection 155 of the Highways Act 1980,external. On Thursday, Mr Murphy-Hankin pleaded guilty to both counts, but denied a third charge of owning a dangerously out-of control dog. He was released on bail until his next court appearance on 31 August, on condition he does not return to the street. The RSPCA, which is currently looking after the female piglet, said the animal was ""only a week old and so will require hand-rearing"".

"West released Ye, his eighth studio album, in June Kanye West was stumped by TV host Jimmy Kimmel when he quizzed the rapper about his support for President Trump. The usually verbose artist seemed lost for words when Kimmel asked him why he thought Mr Trump cared about black people, ""or any people at all"". His silence on Thursday's show prompted Kimmel to cut to a commercial break. West, 41, also talked about designing clothes, his family, and mental health during his first appearance on Kimmel's late-night chat show since 2013. Allow YouTube content?

The host referred to West's famous claim from 2005 that President George W Bush ""doesn't care about black people"", and asked the superstar: ""What makes you think that Donald Trump does - or any people at all?"" West silently contemplated the question for several seconds before Kimmel suggested taking a break. The hip-hop star has previously called Trump ""my brother"" and said they shared the same ""dragon energy"". The rapper paid a visit to Trump Tower shortly after Mr Trump was elected Asked earlier in Thursday's interview why he had decided to endorse Trump publicly, West said he hadn't wanted to succumb to pressure to take the predictable option. ""As a musician, African-American... everyone around me tried to pick my candidate for me,"" he said, suggesting there was a perception that ""blacks can only be Democrats"". Referring to the abbreviation of his first name that provides the title of his latest album, he went on: ""If I'm afraid to be me, I'm no longer Ye. ""I quite enjoy [it] when people are mad at me about certain things."" Kanye West defends Trump in new song Trump thanks Kanye West for tweet West's free-wheeling answers made for an intriguing if occasionally baffling interview, with Kimmel appearing content to let his guest pontificate at length.

"Nine-year-old chess prodigy Shreyas Royal and his family have been allowed to stay in the UK. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he took the ""personal decision"" as Shreyas is ""one of the most gifted chess players in his generation"". Shreyas Royal has lived in Britain since he was three years old. His family was told they would have to return to India when his father's work visa expired in September, but they can now stay under a new work visa. Jitendra Singh, Shreyas's father, received an email from the Home Office on Friday informing him of their decision. He told the BBC the family was ""very happy and relieved"" and that Shreyas ""started jumping on the sofa"" upon hearing the news. This video can not be played Shreyas Royal reacts to the home secretary's decision Shreyas said: ""I was jumping here and there and dancing. I was really happy today. ""I want to be the best at it and become the world chess champion at the age of 18."" Mr Singh's five-year work visa was due to expire next month and he had been told it could not be extended unless he earned Â£120,000 a year, which he does not. The home secretary said: ""After carefully reviewing the evidence, I have taken the personal decision to allow Shreyas and his family to stay in the UK. ""The UK is a country that fosters world class talent and Shreyas is one of the most gifted chess players in his generation. ""We have always been clear we want a world-class immigration system that welcomes highly-talented individuals from across the globe."" Shreyas Royal has competed in European and world championship tournaments Shreyas was born in India but the family moved to south London when his father was offered a job as an IT project manager in the UK. He started learning chess three years ago and has since represented England internationally. He is ranked second in the world for his age group. Mr Singh will be able to apply for the Tier 2 work visa, which is valid for up to five years, without needing to leave the UK. It will be sponsored by his employers, Tata Consultancy Services, and will allow Shreyas and his mother to stay in the UK as dependents. Mr Singh said he wanted to eventually apply for permanent residency. Leon Watson, secretary of Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas is a member, said the news was an ""enormous relief"" and that in 10 years' time, Shreyas could be ""a household name as England's first world champion"". ""Shreyas is a very nice, down-to-earth young man who has a big future ahead of him on the world stage hopefully representing England,"" he said. ""Our country badly needs someone like this, the next Nigel Short or Michael Adams, and we firmly believe Shreyas will do us proud."" A spokesman for the English Chess Federation said they are ""delighted"" by the decision to allow him to stay. Labour MPs Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, and Matthew Pennycook, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, wrote to the home secretary last week urging him to review the case. Ms Reeves said she was ""delighted"" for Shreyas and his family. ""This is also great news for the country, which would've lost one of its best and brightest had Shreyas been deported,"" she added.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties The Saudi-led military coalition has announced it will investigate an air strike in Yemen which killed at least 29 children. On its Twitter feed, Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV quoted a senior official who said the coalition was probing ""collateral damage"" from the strike. Forces struck a bus in Dahyan in the rebel-held province of Saada. The coalition backs Yemen's government against the Houthi rebels and initially deemed its actions ""legitimate"".

"On 12 August, the small, serene city of Charlottesville, Virginia will mark the anniversary of a deadly white nationalist rally that shocked the nation. The violence that day cost the life of a young counter-protester and scarred Charlottesville. An official report condemned city officials for failing to adequately prepare and police for standing by as confrontation turned to chaos. In the year since, some residents have attempted to reckon with the legacy of that weekend and the racial inequality that persists in the city. Others have sought to consign the violence of last summer to the past, in an effort to restore to Charlottesville a lost reputation as a peaceful, progressive place - 2014's official Happiest City in America. Here, in their own words, some of those closest to the events of that weekend tell the story of what happened, why it happened, and what it meant to a city and a nation.You may find some language offensive. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Charlottesville Daily ProgressIt's important to understand that this didn't happen in a vacuum, it didn't just pop up and surprise everybody. It felt over the course of the summer that things were building up in Charlottesville. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentPeople hadn't quite understood the level of violence or hatred or the numbers of people coming to town, but the town was very much aware. It was like a hurricane was coming. Jalane Schmidt, University of Virginia professor, Black Lives Matter activistThe propaganda that the alt-right had put out was martial in its imagery. It was a march on Charlottesville. It was very militaristic. We felt like we were going to be under siege. Dr Michael Williams, surgeon, UVA hospitalWe got a plan in place in anticipation, but I got a fair amount of push-back from my colleagues in surgery. They said ""This is going to be a big nothing."" Seth Wispelwey, local ministerIt felt to me like a profound test. But there was no question about where I belonged and what I wanted to do. Brenda Brown-Grooms, local ministerWe'd been monitoring the social media posts of the alt-right and they were detailing their hopes for the weekend, hopes for inciting a race war in the country, so we knew it was going to be dire. Jalane SchmidtThe crazy thing is we tried to warn the city. We had infiltrated chat rooms, taken screenshots. We made six dossiers, presented them to police, the city council, anyone who would listen. We said, ""This is not a First Amendment rally. They are literally coming to kill us."" Emily Gorcenski, local activistThere were explicit calls for violence there. We presented them to the city in the hope they would shut the rally down before it began. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsThe information we gave them fell on deaf ears. Emily GorcenskiWhen that failed, we knew we were in for a bad day. The statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville How it began -Manycities in America contendedwith their Confederate monumentsand the legacy of slavery, but it would be Charlottesville, near the former capital of theConfederacy, that would bear the brunt of the controversy. Jalane SchmidtIn 2016 a young teenage activist here in Charlottesville started a petition to remove the Confederate monuments. At the same time, we had the Republican primary campaign heating up with Trump winning more and more states. Local white supremacists got upset about the efforts to remove the statues and they were fuelled by the feedback nationally, saying ""This is OK, it's open season to be racist."" Zyahna Bryant, teenage activistI had to write a school paper about something I could change and I had been thinking about public spaces in Charlottesville. I thought it was important to draw attention to how Confederate imagery is violent and what it represents for people of colour. Eventually I turned my paper into a petition. Wes Bellamy, Charlottesville councillor and former deputy mayorWhen I first started talking about moving the statues, people were livid, they hated hearing about it. I started getting racist abuse - ""We're going to get you nigger,"" that kind of thing. Zyahna BryantFor me, it's hard because there are no statues in Charlottesville that depict African-American heroes. And so for that reason alone, black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces. We are not represented. Jalane SchmidtThose statues were put up in the 1920s in order to edify the white public and they are still there for the edification of white people. And now people are shifting the reason. Now it's because they don't want to forget history? Charles Weber, Charlottesville lawyer fightingthe removal of thestatuesOur view was that the city didn't have the authority to do what they proposed to do. Aside from being magnificent works of art and places of beauty for the city, the statues are a memorial to war veterans. It's not in America's DNA to deny its own history. Zyahna Bryant: ""Black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces"" Jalane SchmidtOn 29 January 2017, the mayor called a press conference in front of the city hall. And he announced that Charlottesville was now the capital of the resistance. People cheered. That resonated with a lot of people, but it put a target on our backs. Wes BellamyThe Nazis and Confederates started coming out of the woodwork. Then Jason Kessler came to light. Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rallyI wasn't really involved in local politics, I didn't find Charlottesville politics or any other politics very interesting. Then I was doing yard work one day for a friend and he happened to bring up the Robert E Lee statue and how the city was trying to tear it down. I thought it was symbolic of a lot of things happening in society. Claire GastaÃ±aga, executive director, ACLU VirginiaJason Kessler applied for a permit for a rally at Emancipation Park, some time last spring. The way the Charlottesville process works, a permit is granted automatically if there's no negative decision in 10 days. Jason KesslerShoot, the moment I put in the application didn't feel that eventful. After 10 days it was approved and I set about calling different people in the alternative media, on the internet. Some describe them as alt-right, some as alt-light. Charles WeberJason Kessler and Richard Spencer, both University of Virginia graduates, saw the argument over the statues as a way to promote their own cause. We were horrified by that. Jalane Schmidt, UVA professor and Black Lives Matter activist Nikuyah Walker, counter-protester, now Charlottesville mayorPeople like Kessler and Spencer started to get a little leery of whether white supremacy would be maintained. That's what this was about: ""How dare you, a primarily white council, vote to take down our statues?"" Jason KesslerRichard Spencer is a white nationalist. Personally I don't call myself a white nationalist. I consider myself a civil and human rights advocate, focused on the caucasian demographic. Isaac Smith, former ally of Jason KesslerKessler's idea was to try to unite the alt-right with the mainstream right, and get regular Republicans to show up. Jason KesslerThe moderate speakers did not want to be on the same stage as Richard Spencer, so it ended up being much more far right than I intended it to be. Claire GastaÃ±aga, executive director,ACLU VirginiaPeople had been calling all that week for Kessler's permit to be revoked. After a series of closed meetings, Charlottesville council sent him a letter saying it was revoked but they would consider reissuing it if he moved the rally to a different location. He tweeted us at about 2am on the Tuesday before the weekend, asking if we would be interested in giving him legal assistance. There was nothing about his political positions that we agreed with, but there are rules and governments have to follow those rules. We filed a complaint on Thursday and the judge held a hearing on the Friday night, about 9pm, and ruled that the decision to revoke Kessler's permit was an unconstitutional decision based on the content of his speech. So the permit was reissued. Walt Heinecke, University of Virginia professorWe decided to apply for permits for counter-protests. I teach a class in citizenship so I thought it was time for me to put my money where my mouth was. We are in a battle for the soul of America at this point, and I thought it was time for people to step up. White nationalists gather at the base of the Thomas Jefferson statue on the UVA campus Friday night-White nationalist ralliers gather at Nameless Fieldin Charlottesvilleand march through the University of Virginia Campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. At a statue of Thomas Jefferson, they are met by student activists who link arms around the statue's base. Emily Gorcenski, local activistWe were expecting a torch march at some point. Jason Kessler is a local and we know how he operates. And there's only a few locations something like that could go down. At some point on Friday morning we heard it would be after dark at the university campus. Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserAbout 9.45pm I was walking over to St Paul's Church, and as I stood on the corner of the park I saw Jason Kessler, Richard Spencer, and a bunch of other people walk by. Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporterMe and the managing editor had been tipped off that something was going to happen on campus. We went down there and found a lot of people with unlit torches. They were kind of in the shadows and you couldn't tell who was who, but it was shocking to see how many people were there. I turned around to listen to Jason Kessler speak and when I turned back suddenly the field was alight. It was like it had happened in an instant. Jason KesslerLighting torches is a protest tactic that has been used by all kinds of different people. To think that the KKK invented marching symbolically with torches is outrageous. The way it was explained to me was that it was a funeral march for the fallen dead of our European ancestors. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentThere was an interfaith service across the road at St Paul's and my whole family was there. My one-year-old nephew started crying inside so we went outside and fell asleep, and when we woke up there were white nationalists marching past. Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activistThe preacher came in to the church and said there were Nazis outside with torches, there were hundreds of them and they were marching on the church. There was a lot of confusion. We thought maybe they were coming to the church to torch it. I heard ""You will not replace us, Jews will not replace us."" Seeing them, by the hundreds, the torches bobbing, it was horrifying. Jason Kessler at the UVA campus torch march Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeonWe were made aware that university police were responding to an unexpected assembly, 150-200 people carrying torches. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe were on lockdown at St Paul's, and when I finally got out I was sitting on the brick wall on the corner, and I saw this line of lights coming towards me. I thought ""Oh God, these people can't come right up here."" Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserAn activist came by and said ""Your students are surrounded by Nazis."" I ran over there with a friend and what I noticed was there was no police presence, and there were 150 or so Nazis, fascists with torches, screaming racial epithets. Student activists were around the Jefferson statue, locking arms peacefully, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"". Emily GorcenskiThere was a moment when I saw them marching towards us that I would describe as the worst thing I've ever felt in my life. It was absolute terror. Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporterOne of the things that struck me was the organisation - they were calling for men over 200 pounds to stand on the outside for security, things like that. It was loud, it was chaotic, it was booming in your ears. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI could see and smell the torches. And unfortunately, as a person of colour in this country, I don't have to go back far to remember those things, to remember feeling totally unprotected, unheard, unseen, and unwanted. Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayorThere was a sense of anger that these cowards would march with torches and surround 20 college kids and try to intimidate them. That really showed me who those individuals were. And it let me know how serious it was. Walt HeineckeI waded into the crowd of Nazis with the dean of students and we were assaulted - I got pepper-sprayed, the dean got a torch thrown at him, the students and counter-protesters were being beaten by these guys. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe had been on lockdown in the church. Eventually police arrived over the road at the campus and people began to disperse. We filed out of the back door to avoid the nationalists in the street. Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeonThat was the first clue that our worst fears might come to pass. My feeling for Saturday was ""Oh God, this is really happening."" White nationalists file into Emancipation Park Saturday morning-Local religious leaders fan out across Charlottesville, some to lead prayer services and some to stand on the front line at Emancipation Park. As the morning progresses and the temperature rises, white nationalists and counter-protesters pour into the streets around the park. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe had a sunrise service at six in the morning, at First Baptist Church, Main. It was hot as blazes, as it is wont to be in Charlottesville in August. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaWe had what I call a pre-op briefing which we have before events, where we lay out the plan for the guys for the day. We were nervous. I could see it in the guys, the way they were gearing up. They knew it wasn't going to be good. When we first got to the park, about 7.30am, it was tense. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentAs soon as I got downtown I knew Charlottesville had completely transformed. Rev Seth WispelweyAbout 8am, those of us called to the front line - about 50 in all - marched from First Baptist church on Main Street to Emancipation Park. For two and a half hours, we sang, prayed, and tried to diffuse tension. We bore witness as groups of men began to march in and the temperature started to rise. EzÃ© Amos, freelance photographerAt first, everybody was singing and walking peacefully. As we walked there was a gentleman standing there with a white T-shirt. I knew the uniform and took a few photos and made him look up, and I got a nice clean shot of his face. He turned out to be the driver of the car. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressI got to Emancipation Park at 9am. The rally wasn't scheduled to begin til noon but there were already hundreds of people arriving at the park. There was so much rhetoric around the media, but I'm a white male so I didn't have it that bad. EzÃ© is from Africa, he was much more of a target. EzÃ© AmosI saw the first wave of alt-right guys march up, led by Eli Mosley. They said some things to me, called me a nigger. An alt-right guy in a Hitler and swastika T-shirt punched me in the face in front of the police. The police did absolutely nothing. Rev Seth Wispelwey, centre, locks arms with other clergy members at the entrance to the park Rev Seth WispelweyWe were linking arms at the entrance to the park, just like John Lewis and his people did in Selma. We saw a wave coming over the hill, and I thought ""This is what we prepared for."" Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaThe alt-right filed in carrying clubs and shields. They had their baseball batting helmets, chanting ""White is right"", screaming ""History not heritage"" and things like that. Rev Seth WispelweyThey battered through the line of clergy. Then about 500 members of the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement - literal Nazis - came over the crest of Market Street. Christian YinglingEverybody came together at the same point in the street out in front of the park. The city of Charlottesville knew who was coming to town, they did their homework, so why would you funnel group after group, right and left, right through each other? It made no sense. Ryan KellyThere were barriers in the park to keep people separate but as people went in everyone got mixed up with everyone else. People were throwing bottles, there was pepper spray burning people's eyes. Claire GastaÃ±aga, ACLU VirginiaI was on the corner of Second and Market St. It was clear there was no effort to separate the two sides - there was almost permission to engage in violence. Brennan GilmoreIt was pretty clear to me it was not going to end well. The place was awash with weapons and you didn't know who was legitimate security or who was from a militia. Christian YinglingThirty-two guys walking down the street in full body armour with semi-automatic weapons, sure, it's going to intimidate people. Was that our intention? No. We are a really community-minded organisation and we are trying to get out of that stereotype that militias are fat guys hiding out in the woods waiting for the government. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressThe militia groups claimed they were just maintaining the peace, but they were all wearing camo and military gear and carrying rifles and handguns. It added to the sense of hostility. Emily Gorcenski, local activistThe militia didn't do anything to keep the peace. I think they wanted to stand there and roleplay. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaThe reason for us to be there had nothing to do with white supremacy - I completely disagree with their message. But they had the right to say whatever they wanted, and the counter-protesters had that right too, and that's why we were there. Emily GorcenskiWhen you look at what these militia groups are saying, it's very rarely in the defence of black people, for example. It's very rarely in the defence of liberals or progressives or socialists. It only seems to be in defence of forces in our society that continue to oppress minorities. Christian Yingling of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia, at Emancipation Park Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI was at the First United Methodist Church. We kept being locked down in the building. There were Nazis shouting outside, Antifa trying to combat them. People in the church were trying to sing over the din. The helicopters were hovering overhead, their rotor blades wapping. We looked at one another and started praying hard. Dr Michael WilliamsAs the only physician here at UVA who was involved in 9/11 - I was in DC - the feeling of dread I had was exactly the same. That feeling you were being targeted from the outside by people who were outright evil. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsThere was a narrative that people came to town to stir up trouble, but we have to take that back. Certainly people came to town, but they were also already here. They live here. I see them all the time. Ryan KellyThere were hundreds, if not thousands, of people around the park at this point. It was tough to keep track. Rev Seth WispelweyThere were roving groups of men, most in polo shirts, many carrying sticks, bats, all in the street. What was surreal was seeing all the monuments around the city surrounded by hundreds of people intending to cause violence. When we got face to face with these white supremacists, all the slurs were anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic - we didn't hear anything anti-black or anti-Muslim. It was even more primitive. Christian YinglingOver five and a half hours, we had bricks thrown, people being hurt by clubs, paint and faeces tossed at my people. The majority were from hate groups - they came organised, they had a plan, you could tell by the way they marched. Antifa had their plan too, because they came with coolers full of stuff to throw at people. Isaac Smith, former Jason Kessler allyLook at who was going to be there, you are putting large radical armed groups - actual Nazis - with actual Communists and you are giving them all guns. That was a recipe for disaster. There were definitely alt-right groups I could see were armed to the teeth. And then you also had the far-left, Redneck Revolt. Most of Charlottesville who were counter-demonstrating were peaceful, but there were a lot of out-of-towners who had wanted to punch a Nazi for their whole lives and finally they had an opportunity. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressIt was really strange because it was all happening with this giant police presence around the outer edges of the park. Claire GastaÃ±agaNobody predicted that the police would have been as incompetent as they were. It never occurred to us that they wouldn't keep the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators separate. Nikuyah Walker, counter-protesterPeople were yelling at officers, asking them 'Why didn't you protect us, why didn't you help us?' Ryan KellyIt got worse and worse until the police finally stepped in and said it was an unlawful assembly, and people started to disperse. Dr Michael WilliamsAt the hospital we'd had a trickle of people who were faint from the heat, but in the morning we were mainly just watching the TV and listening to the radio communication. Then I heard on the police radio, ""Pedestrians struck, multiple victims, potentially as many as 40."" A memorial to Heather Heyer at the place where she died Saturday afternoon-At the corner of Water Street and Fourth, a white nationalist rally-goer ploughs into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters in his car, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring19others. James A Fields, 20, is later arrested and charged with murder. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressI was taking photos on Fourth Street and it was calm, it was the calmest I'd felt all day. It was at that exact second when a car sped past me down the street. Out of instinct I grabbed my camera. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHeather went off with her friends that day to say ""This is our town, get out, this is what we believe, if you don't like it, leave"" and to stand strong with her friends in the community to say black lives do matter. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentI heard the acceleration of a car behind and looked around and saw a vehicle flying down the street. It was immediately apparent what was going on by the manner he was driving. The visual was horrifying, the sound of it was revolting. Jack Basile, gave CPR to Heather HeyerAt first I thought it was an explosion, because all I could see was people flying through the air and people screaming and people running towards me. I have an audio recording and it's hard to listen to. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe were watching the live news inside the building, and we screamed when we saw the car hit. The spit fired in my mouth. Emily Gorcenski, local activistWe had been tracking threats of violence online so I knew right away it was an attack, not an accident. My thought at that moment was that he was going to pop out and start shooting at people. My instinct was to run towards the car, towards the attacker. I briefly drew my gun so I was ready in case he did come out shooting. Thankfully he didn't. Ryan Kelly took 80 pictures as the car sped past. He won the Pulitzer Prize for this frame Jack BasileI saw the car backing up the street then I saw Heather lying on her side. I reached around Heather's head and realised instantly it was bad. Then time just seemed to stop. Brennan GilmoreIt was a terrible, terrible moment and all hell broke loose. People were lying in various states of distress, a woman collapsed in front of me. It occurred to me I had been filming it. I debated whether or not to share it, and my first instinct was not to. Emily GorcenskiWe decided at that point was to leave the scene, because some of us had guns and the best thing to do in that scenario was to get the guns out of the situation. Jack BasileWe pulled Heather out from underneath another guy and she took a deep breath and relaxed. There was a critical care nurse who had arrived beside me. I couldn't feel a pulse, she couldn't feel a pulse, and she said let's start CPR. She was doing compressions and I was using a one-way valve mask to help Heather breathe. After a few minutes the police finally showed up. Then paramedics arrived and took over. I walked across the street and sat on the corner in a state of complete and utter shock. Dr Michael WilliamsWe were watching the news and saw the car fly through. When Heather Heyer came in, CPR was in progress and then 14 others came in. We occasionally see blunt force trauma victims, but it's never or rarely intentional. And it's very rare that we'd get 10 at once, from the same incident. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHeather's best friend called me to tell me that the hospital was looking for the next of kin and I knew if he called me, there was something wrong because he never calls unless something's wrong. Dr Michael WilliamsPeople were brought in covered in swastikas and other symbols I would equate with hate. But in the moment we were just taking care of the patients. You don't see the swastikas. I'm African-American, and afterwards, you realise you have got a person here who literally would just as sooner see you dead. But you remind yourself of why you got into the profession. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressIt wasn't until I looked at the pictures in full size that the gravity of it hit me. There was one photo specifically that I thought was the most telling, and that was the one we have all seen, the one that went viral and won the Pulitzer. We didn't publish it initially. I talked to my editor and the other photographer, they went to the company and the lawyer and they said ""Let's publish it."" Brennan GilmoreI thought that showing [what I had filmed] was necessary to tell people in Charlottesville ""stay away, stay home, the stakes are fatal."" It never entered my mind that I would be targeted for sharing it. It wasn't until a day later that I heard about the conspiracy theory, that everything I had seen was a set-up, a propaganda operation. These far-right boards had listed my family members. I went through a hellish week of being targeted by these conspiracy theorists. I had friends I'd grown up with who were accusing me. Susan BroI can't begin to tell you how horrendous that day was. They walked me up to the room and the detective told me that she was pronounced dead. I just put down my head and let out an ungodly sound. Jack BasileI had a really, really difficult time afterwards and it is still with me. I still have my press pass from that day, in a bag, and it still has blood on it. Susan BroAfter Heather died there was a period of time, probably three months at least, and it still happens occasionally, where I'd be walking through town and someone would come up to me and say ""I knew Heather and she touched my life."" Three hours after the attack, a Virginia State Police helicopterwhich was monitoring the rally crashed outsideCharlottesville, killingLieutenant H Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M M Bates. People draw on a sidewalk near a memorial to Heather Heyer, ahead of the anniversary Tuesday afternoon, New York - President Trump has already made two statements on Charlottesville, first stating on Saturday, to the dismay of many watching, that there was violence ""on many sides"", before delivering prepared remarks on Sunday in which he condemned white nationalism. At a press conference in New York on Tuesday, he makes his third statement on the violence. Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The HillThe press conference was billed as an announcement on infrastructure and we were told he wasn't planning on taking questions. You never know what's going to happen with him, but we weren't expecting him to wade back into this. He started to wrap up and a reporter shouted out a question and he answered it, and it was off to the races. Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activistI was watching TV and I heard Trump say there were ""good people on both sides"". Jordan FabianAs he made those remarks, the atmosphere at the press conference got more and more heated. I remember, there was a lot of staff in the lobby of Trump Tower. John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, was off to one side rubbing his temples. I looked at Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary, and she was standing there silently. They looked shocked at how it was playing out. Christine Emba, opinion editor, The Washington PostThe hope was that surely, surely the President of the United States would say something appropriate. Say ""This is not who we are."" Or ""Racism is bad"", perhaps? That we are against white supremacy? The fact that he could not bring himself to do that was a shocking confirmation that we were in a newly bad place. Zyahna Bryant,Charlottesvillehigh school studentI was in Charlottesville near downtown and I was watching him on the TV with some friends and we were all just like, what? Twitter was blowing up, Facebook and Instagram were blowing up. Jordan FabianJust judging from the body language, I think a lot of his staff were uncomfortable with what he was saying. Gary Cohn appeared to be gesturing to the president to wrap it up. Of course the president just kept talking and talking. Jalane SchmidtThere was dismay. To have your president say that - it was mortifying that anybody could dare make any moral equivalency between counter-protesters and these white supremacist haters bent on murder. It was just insulting. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Lightfoot MilitiaI was standing in the kitchen and I remember the moment he said ""There are good people on both sides and bad people on both sides"", and then he threw in a little nugget about the one good group that was there. That really caught my ear. I looked at my wife, ""Did I just get a nod from the president?"" ""I think you did,"" she said. Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rallyIn the environment of sensationalism, and blaming only one side, it was good to hear the president mention that we had a permit. People don't know that. This video can not be played Trump's Tuesday press conference at Trump Tower Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherTrump's office called while I was at the funeral and I had my phone turned off. I turned my phone on at 10pm and I saw that there had been three voicemails from the president's office. They sounded increasingly frantic. I turned on the news and heard him say that there were good people on both sides and I thought, I don't want to talk to him. Christian YinglingIt was really like any other protest - there were good people on both sides. Not all the people who went up to the park that day were white supremacists. Isaac Smith, former Kessler allyIt was relatively clumsy, but not fundamentally incorrect. There are better ways he could have made the same point.. There were people on both sides who energetically participated in violence: it's not as simple as 'one side attacked the other and one side defended themselves'. Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The HillIf you compare to previous administrations, I don't think there would be situation where you would have a soft-pedalling reaction to any kind of white supremacist violence. But the president had said what he said the first time, and sort of taken it back. Then when he doubled down on his first response at that press conference at Trump Tower, in such a vehement way, I think that let a lot of people know that's what he truly felt about the situation. Christine Emba, Washington PostAs an African American person living in America, it felt like a double betrayal. First, he couldn't bring himself to admit that it was not ""both sides"" - that there's a difference between white supremacists and people pushing back against them. Then we had to wait for him to be reined in by a trained communications professional, but he still couldn't stick to that.In the end, he said what he really wanted to say. He was addressing aid and comfort to the people he wanted to reassure, and that was white supremacists and his more racist supporters. He put himself on the side of an America we had hoped we were leaving behind. Zyahna BryantWhat he said really created a ripple effect. I've heard people all over, even within our community, say we have to pay attention to the violence on both sides. Jordan FabianI think that still a year later stands out as one of the lowest moments of President Trump's time in office. Christine EmbaAnd he hasn't done very much since to make anyone feel better. He went from that to deriding the NFL protesters who took a knee, to calling African nations shithole countries, to calling MS-13 members animals. It hasn't gotten better. A Confederate battle flag flies over the I-64 highway, outside Charlottesville, August 1, 2018 Today-Charlottesville has elected Nikuyah Walker, who was among the counter-protesters in August, as the city's first black woman mayor, andmany in the citysee progress wrought from the wounds of that weekend. Others see a deep racial inequality laid bare but barely changed by what happened. TheConfederate statues still stand, and the city has declared a state of emergency ahead of the anniversary. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI was born in Charlottesville in the basement of the University of Virginia, among the lead-dripping pipes, because that's where the coloured babies were born. I could not have been born at Martha Jefferson hospital. Even if my mother had been crowning with me she would not have been allowed in. There is an ugly truth in Charlottesville and in America, and it is the legacy of white supremacy. Nikuyah Walker, mayor of CharlottesvilleCharlottesville has always been a pretty segregated area. I grew up like many black families in the community: working-class families, parents working every day, multiple jobs, attempting to make ends meet. It's a very different experience from the Charlottesville in our brochures and the ""world-class city"" designation we attempt to give ourselves. Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayorWe used to think we were somehow better than the other communities and cities in which you saw overt white supremacy. Ours was always much more covert and underhanded, it wasn't directly in your face. Nikuyah WalkerI know previous generations - my parents' generation, grandparents - learned to stay out of the way, learned to do what you need to do to get by. Jalane SchmidtLocal white folks tend to think of this as a liberal place but black people - and I am African American - we see a lot of contradictions. The police stopping and frisking black people. The gentrification. The lack of affordable housing. The struggle to get living wage. Zyahna Bryant, student who wrote the original statue petitionThere are still unspoken boundaries in Charlottesville, places where people of colour are not welcome. The downtown mall is not a very welcoming space. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHave things changed in Charlottesville? It depends on who you ask. If you ask a wealthy white person, the town is wonderful and it has always been wonderful. If you ask someone who is not wealthy and not white, you would get a different perspective. August 12 was not the beginning or the end of the situation here. Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, standing ahead of the anniversary at the place her daughter was killed Zyahna BryantAugust 12 was only a reflection of the history of Charlottesville and how racist it really is. August 12 is every day. A lot of people want us to move into this ""August 13"" phase where we move past everything, but we are still in this paralysis of August 12. We are still there. EzÃ© Amos, photographerSome things have started to change, in the sense that people talk about the racial divide, inequality. More white people are being outspoken about it, which I really appreciate. Claire GastaÃ±aga, ACLU VirginiaWhat happened provoked a sense that we haven't really had the conversations about race in America that we need to have. There's a great need for that. Whether there's the will for it remains an important question. Wes BellamyWe just took 120 people from Charlottesville on a pilgrimage to Montgomery, Alabama, to learn about civil rights and the history of lynching. We have finally recognised John Henry James, a man who was lynched here in 1898. We put a lynching marker up and gave him his proper due. Those things would not have happened were it not for what occurred that weekend. The legacy is not just about statues and park names, those are ultimately superficial things. There are things happening on the ground that are changing the landscape of the community. Ryan Kelly, photographerI love this city, but what happened was a scar on Charlottesville. The fact the whole world now knows this place now because of one attack is depressing. Rev Seth WispelweyOutside of town, I feel Charlottesville had a really positive impact. But it's been hard to face here because we are continuing to live under the threat of white supremacist violence. Susan BroThe hate does not seem to disappear, it just keeps changing forms. Charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, on a recent summer day Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserThe community in Charlottesville is pretty much ready for whatever happens on the anniversary. Susan BroJason Kessler says he isn't going to do anything here but I wouldn't count on people not showing up. Jason KesslerI was originally hoping to do something in Charlottesville but we had to drop those plans. I don't think Charlottesville has a commitment to public safety. I think it's better for me and the citizens of Charlottesville to have parted ways, and they can heal from whatever mental wounds they've had from this sordid affair and I can do the same. Christine Emba, Washington PostI think people of colour were really affected by Charlottesville, by seeing that historical violence dredged into the present. I think many felt isolated by it. You might be surrounded by white neighbours and friends who say, ""I'm so sorry for you, but we should move on,"" and it's a very isolating feeling. Zyahna BryantThere are people here who continue to deny that racism is even a thing, or that white supremacy is a thing. But white supremacists keep coming to town. Some of them live right here in Charlottesville. We are at a point where it's time to choose a side: either you are going to be on the right side or the wrong side of history. Wes BellamyI still get abuse every day. You think white supremacists are going to stop calling me nigger because of something that happened one weekend last year? Or because now I have a doctorate? Now they call me doctor nigger.

"John Barnard, from Mold, Jim Bloomer, from Cumbria, and Graham Jackson, from Chester, measured the height of Miller Moss on 1 August A peak in the Lake District has been upgraded to mountain status after being found to be higher than originally thought. Miller Moss had been recorded at 609m (1,998ft) - 1m (3ft) too short to be classified as a mountain. Surveyors Graham Jackson, 68, and John Barnard, 69, have now measured it at 610.1m, 3ft over the 2,000ft threshold. Ordnance Survey (OS) said it would now be updating maps to show the new height. The reclassification takes the number of mountains in England and Wales to 446, as classified by John and Ann Nuttall in the officially recognised The Mountains of England and Wales. Mr Barnard said the ""result was fantastic, it was a promotion so that makes us quite pleased"". The former work colleagues have been surveying mountains for about 12 years and took about eight hours to establish Miller Moss's height. All the equipment needed weighs 12kg Working with fellow mountaineer Jim Bloomer, they used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) kit, checked against OS base station data. This is more accurate than the photogrammetry used to take the original reading, which has a margin of error of +/- 3m. ""So you look at the map and you look at anything around 609 and think, well, that's worth looking at,"" Mr Barnard said. Peak declared mountain after survey Survey turns hill into a mountain,external Miller Moss had been on the ""intray for a long time"" as they suspected it could easily be promoted to mountain status, he said. The equipment used in the work weighed 12kg, which is ""quite a lot of kit to carry up"", Mr Barnard said. As it costs between Â£15,000 and Â£20,000, ""you don't want to lose it in a gale"", he added. Mr Barnard said he did not believe there were many hills left that they had not checked.

"Jason Gaskell severed Laura Huteson's jugular vein and carotid artery while having sex A man has been jailed for six years for killing a woman he stabbed in the throat during a ""bizarre and violent"" sex game. Jason Gaskell severed 21-year-old Laura Huteson's jugular vein and carotid artery with a knife while having sex at his home in Hull on 27 February. Sheffield Crown Court heard the pair, who had only met earlier that day, had been drinking vodka and taking cocaine. Gaskell, 24, of Mildane, Hull, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter. Yorkshire breaking news: Nine-year-old victim of seaside rock fall named; City hit by smoke smell from fire 90 miles away Jailing Gaskell, Judge Jeremy Richardson said: ""In simple terms you unlawfully killed a woman with whom you were having sexual intercourse by stabbing her through the neck during bizarre and violent sadomasochistic sexual activity. ""You did not intend that to happen, but the danger of stabbing the victim was obvious, and it eventuated. ""You took that risk knowingly and deliberately and you have paid a terrible price. ""The price paid, however, by Laura Huteson, was infinitely greater. She is dead."" Gaskell pleaded guilty to killing 21-year-old Laura Huteson The judge said there was no suggestion the sex had been non-consensual. ""It appears you harboured a desire for, and regularly put into practice, a particularly extreme form of sexual activity in that you enjoyed sadomasochism whereby you held the throats of sexual partners very tightly and regularly used a knife in the midst of sexual congress, usually by holding it against the throat of a woman. ""You kept a knife under your pillow for that purpose,"" Judge Richardson said. As he was led from the dock Gaskell, who wept through large parts of the hearing, thanked the judge before looking to the public gallery and saying ""I love you"". He was initially charged with murder but pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter at a hearing last month. Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said: ""By his plea he had accepted that he deliberately held a knife to her neck during sexual intercourse. ""The knife passed through her skin and in to the soft tissue of her neck breaching the jugular vein and carotid artery and she died from the substantial blood loss."" In a statement read out in court, Miss Huteson's mother said she had been left feeling ""empty"" and unable to eat or sleep. She said: ""She did not deserve to die. He [Gaskell] has destroyed us all."" In a letter to the judge, Gaskell said: ""I know words can't bring Laura back but I offer the deepest apology and hold myself accountable for the events that resulted in these horrific circumstances."" ""Laura's family have shown courage and determination during the investigations and the court proceedings"", Humberside Police said.

"Lewis Ludlow appeared at the Old Bailey via a videolink from prison A man has pleaded guilty to plotting a terror attack on London's Oxford Street and raising money for terrorism. Lewis Ludlow, 26, planned to hire a van and hit pedestrians and also targeted Madame Tussauds and St Paul's Cathedral, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey and is due to be sentenced on 2 November. Ludlow, who also used the name Ali Hussain, had hoped to kill up to 100 people. A spokesman for the CPS said he had been under 24-hour armed police surveillance. Ludlow, from Rochester, Kent, first came to the attention of police in 2010 when he attended a demonstration led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned Al-Muhajiroun group. When Ludlow was arrested in 2015, Islamic State group material was found on his electronic devices but no further action was taken. He had also been in contact with Junaid Hussain, an IS fighter from the UK who waskilled in drone strike in 2016, the prosecution said. Police also observed Ludlow at Al-Muhajiroun group demonstrations, where he was seen with, or near, Anjem Choudary and Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale. Ludlow claimed he was travelling to the Philippines as a sex tourist In January, Ludlow bought a ticket to fly to the Philippines but he was stopped at the airport and his passport seized. He claimed he was going to the country as a sex tourist but was found to have been in communication with a man named Abu Yaqeen in an area with a significant IS presence. In March, Ludlow sent him money via PayPal and created the Facebook account Antique Collections, which he was alleged to have used as a front to send money to south-east Asia for terrorism. On 16 March, Ludlow went online to establish whether there was a police station on Oxford Street, before setting out to take pictures of the shopping area. He took a picture near to the Oxford Circus Tube station and then a second one outside the Disney store. Later he photographed Madame Tussauds and a bus shelter map of the area around the tourist attraction. The images were stored in an encrypted application on his phone shared among IS supporters. Ludlow made detailed notes of possible targets in London When police searched Ludlow's home, they also found torn-up notes detailing when the targets would be the busiest. The first note read: ""Madame Tussads [sic]. Oxford street busiest time between 11 - 12 particularly Fridays. St Paul's Cathedral. Shia temple... Further locations scouted for the Kil [sic]."" A second read: ""Crowded London Areas, Oxford Street - long road with no bollards or barriers preventing a van mounting the pavement. Busiest time is between 11am - 12pm with Saturday being the busiest day. ""It is a busy street it is ideal for an attack. It is expected nearly 100 could be killed in the attack."" Two further notes referred to accommodation and van rental. In a communication found on one of his phones Ludlow, who did not hold a driving licence, said: ""Driving isn't easy Only reason why I never learnt is because its expensive plus a bit scared of crashing."" Ludlow took photos of Oxford Street He also travelled to Madame Tussauds on Baker Street The CPS spokesman said: ""A mobile phone belonging to Ludlow was found in the storm drain of his home and contained photographs he had taken in March on a trip to London. The phone also contained videos in which Ludlow stated his hatred of unbelievers and his desire to establish Sharia law. Ludlow, who appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink from HMP Belmarsh, also pleaded guilty to setting up Facebook and Paypal accounts which the CPS said he used to fund fighters based in the Philippines. He had been previously questioned by police about his links to Anjem Choudary and the banned Al-Muhajiron group. Ludlow also admitted raising funds for terrorist purposes but denied preparing a plan to travel to the Philippines to join jihadists there. That charge will remain on file.

"Ben Stokes denies affray in a trial at Bristol Crown Court England cricketer Ben Stokes admitted throwing several punches at a man outside a nightclub in Bristol, a jury has heard. The Durham all-rounder, who denies affray, has taken to the stand for a second day at Bristol Crown Court. Mr Stokes, 27, said: ""It's clear in my statements that I admit to throwing multiple punches."" He is on trial alongside Ryan Ali, 28, who the cricketer is alleged to have knocked out, outside the Mbargo club. Mr Ali has also denied a charge of affray while Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted of the same charge on Thursday. Mr Stokes told the court he felt ""constantly under threat"" by Mr Ali and Mr Hale who he claims made homophobic slurs to two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. But when questioned by the prosecution, he admitted ""slapping"" but not knocking out Mr Ali or being very drunk. This video can not be played Footage from the arresting officer's bodycam was shown to the jury at Mr Stokes' trial He agreed he had had at least 10 drinks, including pints of beer, vodka and lemonade as well as ""a few"" Jagerbombs, which are shots usually mixed with energy drinks. Under cross-examination by Mr Ali's defence counsel, he was questioned whether he had misheard what was being said. But, he maintained Mr Ali and Mr Hale made homophobic comments outside the club in the Clifton triangle area of Bristol during the early hours of 25 September last year. Ben Stokes 'stepped in' to defend gay men Ben Stokes 'mocked gay men before fight'' Ben Stokes 'spiteful before fight' Mr Stokes told the jury he was not ""threatening or aggressive"" towards the men. ""I'd say I was verbally saying 'I don't think you should be saying that to these two guys because they're gay',"" he said. He also said he could not remember the specific homophobic words used. ""As I've said I can't recollect anything specific, but I'm very clear the words used were a homophobic nature."" As the prosecution began its cross-examination of the cricketer, the jury was shown CCTV pictures from outside Mbargo, where he was denied entry. Mr Stokes admitted trying to bribe doorman Andrew Cunningham with Â£60 to get in, but denied it was as much as Â£300. He also denied being spiteful and aggressive or making derogatory marks about the doorman's tattoos or throwing a cigarette in his direction when he was refused entry. The court heard Mr Cunningham perceived Mr Stokes as ""mocking"" the gay men's mannerisms"" and mimicking ""their voices and effeminate nature"", which the defendant refuted. The jury was shown CCTV footage apparently showing the men involved - including Ben Stokes - in a fight in the street Mr Stokes also denied being angry about not being allowed back into the club, where he was with fellow England player Alex Hales. The court heard Mr Stokes had first played with Mr Hales in 2011, prompting prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis to suggest ""you'd recognise his voice would you not?"".  The defendant agreed he would. But when Mr Corsellis asked whether he heard Mr Hales call out to him, ""Stokes stop, Stokes noâ¦"", during the incident, he said he did not. ""Did you not appreciate that the person who grabbed you by the arm was Alex Hales? Do you not remember he tried to grab you?,"" said Mr Corsellis, to which Mr Stokes said ""no."" The cricketer also denied feeling enraged when his friend, Mr Hales was ""ran at with a glass bottle"" by Mr Ali. Mr Stokes replied: ""Throughout this whole incident my whole focus was where Mr Ali was and where Mr Hale was, from the moment I was verbally threatened and my friend Alex was run at with a glass bottle."" Chris Sandys, BBC News Ben Stokes's attire, demeanour, speech and poise have all remained the same throughout several hours of giving evidence. Most of the time he remains standing, with the occasional request to sit which eases the back pain he is apparently suffering with. Many of his responses have been short and mostly themed around having little memory of the night he is being quizzed over. Prosecuting, Mr Corsellis asked: ""Were you enraged?"". ""No, at this time my sole focus was to protect myself,"" Mr Stokes replied. He was then asked by the prosecution whether he tried to retaliate against Mr Ali after being disarmed by him, which he denied. Mr Corsellis asked: ""Is it what we see on the footage - an angry man who has lost all control?"" Stokes replied: ""Absolutely not."" The trial continues. Ben Stokes trial: CCTV footage of fight.

Documents were found with the man, and after a police appeal his next-of-kin have now been contacted. Avon and Somerset Police said it will provide them with support while the formal identification process takes place. Inside the tent were a newspaper dated August 2016 and a driving licence and birth certificate.

"The construction sector grew by 0.9% over the quarter Economic growth in the UK picked up in the three months to June as construction and services were lifted by the warmer weather, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The economy grew by 0.4% in the period,external, compared with a rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of the year. However, the ONS added that underlying growth remained ""modest"". The ONS also said that the economy grew by 0.1% in June, down from a more robust 0.3% in the previous month. The head of national accounts at the ONS, Rob Kent-Smith, said: ""The economy picked up a little in the second quarter, with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. ""However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. ""The UK's trade deficit noticeably worsened, as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose."" Figures from the ONS,externalshowed the total UK trade deficit widened by Â£4.7bn to Â£8.6bn in the three months to June. The service sector - which accounts for nearly 80% of the UK economy - grew by 0.5% in the second quarter of the year. Construction output jumped 0.9%, but industrial production fell 0.8% during the period. The ONS also mentioned World Cup celebrations as a contributing factor to the pick-up in growth. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We are pleased to see a recovery of the economy in the second quarter - a robust figure which points to the underlying fundamental strength of the British economy."" However, the ONS said: ""Abstracting from these quarterly movements, the underlying trend in real GDP is one of slowing growth. ""The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the first half of 2018, compared with the second half of 2017 - continuing the declining trend seen since the second half of 2014."" Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""More than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories' mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. ""Growth is anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories' falling pound."" Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: ""A rebound in economic growth in the second quarter should be taken with a pinch of salt. Even with some acceleration, the economy is far from its peak. ""The rate of growth looks subdued in comparison to some global peers, with the US economy growing at twice the speed. ""There are a number of factors underpinning sluggish economic expansion; the EU, a major trading partner for the UK has also seen momentum slow and businesses continue to be hindered by Brexit uncertainty."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""While there was a welcome uptick in GDP growth in the second quarter, the figures have been flattered somewhat by a very weak first quarter, and so does little to alter the UK's lacklustre growth trajectory. ""There is little in the latest data to suggest a sustained upturn in the UK's economic growth prospects, or evidence to corroborate the [Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's] decision to raise interest rates.""

"Boris Johnson's remarks about Muslim women wearing the burka were ""inflammatory and divisive"", the UK's equalities watchdog says. The former foreign secretary said people in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission said his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"". Dozens of complaints to the Tory Party are being investigated but Mr Johnson has stood by his remarks. Some Conservatives are unhappy at the party's response, and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC: ""My general view is I don't think that an internal party system should be there to shut down MPs when they speak."" Comedian Rowan Atkinson expressed support for Mr Johnson ina letter to the Times newspaper,external, saying ""no apology is required"" for ridiculing religion. But one of Mr Johnson's critics, Conservative Muslim Forum founder Lord Sheikh, told BBC Newsnight he received ""vile"" Islamophobic messages after calling for him to be thrown out of the Conservative Party. Why some Muslim women wear the veil Boris Johnson's burka remark 'insulting' The equalities commission is understood to have received a complaint from a member of the public about Mr Johnson's comments. Its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: ""The effectiveness of our democratic society depends on freedom of expression, and the expression of offensive and intolerant opinions is generally not unlawful. ""Boris Johnson's use of language in this instance, which risks dehumanising and vilifying Muslim women, is inflammatory and divisive. Political figures should lead by example, conducting debates in a responsible manner, and language such as this can inhibit legitimate dialogue."" Lord Sheikhsaid earlier this week that Mr Johnson should be kicked out of the partyfor his remarks. And speaking to Newsnight on Thursday, he added that in his view Mr Johnson had ""let the genie out of the bottle"" by inflaming tensions with his comments. Out of 75 emails he had since received about the issue, 15 were complimentary while the rest included ""offensive language"" and ""horrible things, obscene things, about the Prophet Muhammad"", Lord Sheikh told the BBC. The complaints to the Conservative Party against Mr Johnson are being looked at by an internal party team, which will decide whether any should be examined by an independent panel. Ultimately complaints can end up with the party's board, which has powers that include suspension or expulsion. This video can not be played Lord Sheikh: ""Boris Johnson has let the genie out of the bottle"" A source close to Mr Johnson offered no comment on the move while a Tory spokesman said: ""The code of conduct process is strictly confidential."" But Blackadder and Mr Bean creator Atkinson told the Times: ""I do think that Boris Johnson's joke about wearers of the burka resembling letterboxes is a pretty good one. ""All jokes about religion cause offence, so it's pointless apologising for them."" The comedian and comedy writerhas previously campaigned against legislation,externalthat made it an offence to incite religious hatred on the basis that it could stifle freedom of speech. Ex-Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell has also said Mr Johnson should not have to apologise. He said Mr Johnson had ""expressed himself in quite colourful language, but he hasn't committed any offence and we need to be very careful about our handling of this because we believe in free speech in this country"". The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. The Conservative Muslim Forum and the Muslim Council of Britain had already raised concerns before Mr Johnson's article. Protesters gathered in Mr Johnson's constituency calling for his resignation. One hundred Muslim women who wear the niqab or burka have signed a letter to Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, calling on him to withdraw the Conservative whip from Mr Johnson - whose Uxbridge constituency was targeted by around 30 protesters calling for his resignation - and launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. ""We are not forced to make these clothing choices, nor are we oppressed,"" the women wrote in their letter, which has been issued to the media by the Muslim Council of Britain.

"Ben Stokes denies affray in a trial at Bristol Crown Court England cricketer Ben Stokes admitted throwing several punches at a man outside a nightclub in Bristol, a jury has heard. The Durham all-rounder, who denies affray, has taken to the stand for a second day at Bristol Crown Court. Mr Stokes, 27, said: ""It's clear in my statements that I admit to throwing multiple punches."" He is on trial alongside Ryan Ali, 28, who the cricketer is alleged to have knocked out, outside the Mbargo club. Mr Ali has also denied a charge of affray while Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted of the same charge on Thursday. Mr Stokes told the court he felt ""constantly under threat"" by Mr Ali and Mr Hale who he claims made homophobic slurs to two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. But when questioned by the prosecution, he admitted ""slapping"" but not knocking out Mr Ali or being very drunk. This video can not be played Footage from the arresting officer's bodycam was shown to the jury at Mr Stokes' trial He agreed he had had at least 10 drinks, including pints of beer, vodka and lemonade as well as ""a few"" Jagerbombs, which are shots usually mixed with energy drinks. Under cross-examination by Mr Ali's defence counsel, he was questioned whether he had misheard what was being said. But, he maintained Mr Ali and Mr Hale made homophobic comments outside the club in the Clifton triangle area of Bristol during the early hours of 25 September last year. Ben Stokes 'stepped in' to defend gay men Ben Stokes 'mocked gay men before fight'' Ben Stokes 'spiteful before fight' Mr Stokes told the jury he was not ""threatening or aggressive"" towards the men. ""I'd say I was verbally saying 'I don't think you should be saying that to these two guys because they're gay',"" he said. He also said he could not remember the specific homophobic words used. ""As I've said I can't recollect anything specific, but I'm very clear the words used were a homophobic nature."" As the prosecution began its cross-examination of the cricketer, the jury was shown CCTV pictures from outside Mbargo, where he was denied entry. Mr Stokes admitted trying to bribe doorman Andrew Cunningham with Â£60 to get in, but denied it was as much as Â£300. He also denied being spiteful and aggressive or making derogatory marks about the doorman's tattoos or throwing a cigarette in his direction when he was refused entry. The court heard Mr Cunningham perceived Mr Stokes as ""mocking"" the gay men's mannerisms"" and mimicking ""their voices and effeminate nature"", which the defendant refuted. The jury was shown CCTV footage apparently showing the men involved - including Ben Stokes - in a fight in the street Mr Stokes also denied being angry about not being allowed back into the club, where he was with fellow England player Alex Hales. The court heard Mr Stokes had first played with Mr Hales in 2011, prompting prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis to suggest ""you'd recognise his voice would you not?"".  The defendant agreed he would. But when Mr Corsellis asked whether he heard Mr Hales call out to him, ""Stokes stop, Stokes noâ¦"", during the incident, he said he did not. ""Did you not appreciate that the person who grabbed you by the arm was Alex Hales? Do you not remember he tried to grab you?,"" said Mr Corsellis, to which Mr Stokes said ""no."" The cricketer also denied feeling enraged when his friend, Mr Hales was ""ran at with a glass bottle"" by Mr Ali. Mr Stokes replied: ""Throughout this whole incident my whole focus was where Mr Ali was and where Mr Hale was, from the moment I was verbally threatened and my friend Alex was run at with a glass bottle."" Chris Sandys, BBC News Ben Stokes's attire, demeanour, speech and poise have all remained the same throughout several hours of giving evidence. Most of the time he remains standing, with the occasional request to sit which eases the back pain he is apparently suffering with. Many of his responses have been short and mostly themed around having little memory of the night he is being quizzed over. Prosecuting, Mr Corsellis asked: ""Were you enraged?"". ""No, at this time my sole focus was to protect myself,"" Mr Stokes replied. He was then asked by the prosecution whether he tried to retaliate against Mr Ali after being disarmed by him, which he denied. Mr Corsellis asked: ""Is it what we see on the footage - an angry man who has lost all control?"" Stokes replied: ""Absolutely not."" The trial continues. Ben Stokes trial: CCTV footage of fight.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made a number of changes to crackdown on US migrant policy A federal judge has ordered a mother and her daughter to be flown back to the United States, after learning they had been deported mid-appeal. The two were being represented in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who said they had fled ""extreme sexual and gang violence"". The judge said it was unacceptable they had been removed during their appeal. He reportedly also said Attorney General Jeff Sessions could be held in contempt of court for the deportation. Mr Sessions introduced tighter immigration rules in June andvictims of domestic abuse and gang violence no longer generally qualify for US asylum. The mother and daughter were part of a case filed by the ACLU and the Centre for Gender and Refugee Studies on behalf of 12 mothers and children who said they had fled violence but were at risk of deportation. The government had pledged not to deport anyone in the case before Friday at the earliest, the ACLU said. Inside the chaos to reunite families My life trapped in an American city Separation protests sweep the US But the ACLU said they had learned during Thursday's emergency hearing that the mother and daughter had already been put on a flight back to El Salvador by US authorities. Washington DC District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan said that it was unacceptable that people claiming asylum had been removed while lawyers argued their case. Describing the situation as ""outrageous"", he ordered the pair be returned immediately, according to reports. An official from the Department of Homeland Security told the Reuters agency that the agency had worked to comply with the court's order. ""Upon arrival in El Salvador, the plaintiffs did not disembark and are currently en route back to the United States,"" the department said in an emailed statement. The mother and daughter are said to have arrived back in Texas, where they were being held, by Thursday night. According to the ACLU, hundreds of migrant children remain separated from their parents after a policy change According to the lawsuit, the migrant mother, known under the alias ""Carmen"", came to the US with her young daughter after two decades of sexual abuse from her husband and death threats from a local gang in her native El Salvador. But their case was halted when officers found they did not have a ""credible fear of persecution"". The case comes at a time when US migrant policy remains firmly under the spotlight after it emerged in June that migrant children were being separated from their families at the US border. The policy led to widespread outrage and condemnation. Mr Trump signed an executive order seeking to end the policy, but more than 500 children remained apart from their families as of Thursday.

"The construction sector grew by 0.9% over the quarter Economic growth in the UK picked up in the three months to June as construction and services were lifted by the warmer weather, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The economy grew by 0.4% in the period,external, compared with a rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of the year. However, the ONS added that underlying growth remained ""modest"". The ONS also said that the economy grew by 0.1% in June, down from a more robust 0.3% in the previous month. The head of national accounts at the ONS, Rob Kent-Smith, said: ""The economy picked up a little in the second quarter, with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. ""However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. ""The UK's trade deficit noticeably worsened, as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose."" Figures from the ONS,externalshowed the total UK trade deficit widened by Â£4.7bn to Â£8.6bn in the three months to June. The service sector - which accounts for nearly 80% of the UK economy - grew by 0.5% in the second quarter of the year. Construction output jumped 0.9%, but industrial production fell 0.8% during the period. The ONS also mentioned World Cup celebrations as a contributing factor to the pick-up in growth. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We are pleased to see a recovery of the economy in the second quarter - a robust figure which points to the underlying fundamental strength of the British economy."" However, the ONS said: ""Abstracting from these quarterly movements, the underlying trend in real GDP is one of slowing growth. ""The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the first half of 2018, compared with the second half of 2017 - continuing the declining trend seen since the second half of 2014."" Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""More than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories' mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. ""Growth is anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories' falling pound."" Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: ""A rebound in economic growth in the second quarter should be taken with a pinch of salt. Even with some acceleration, the economy is far from its peak. ""The rate of growth looks subdued in comparison to some global peers, with the US economy growing at twice the speed. ""There are a number of factors underpinning sluggish economic expansion; the EU, a major trading partner for the UK has also seen momentum slow and businesses continue to be hindered by Brexit uncertainty."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""While there was a welcome uptick in GDP growth in the second quarter, the figures have been flattered somewhat by a very weak first quarter, and so does little to alter the UK's lacklustre growth trajectory. ""There is little in the latest data to suggest a sustained upturn in the UK's economic growth prospects, or evidence to corroborate the [Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's] decision to raise interest rates.""

"Is the rhetoric returning to the big guns? North Korea's foreign ministry has lashed out at the US for not lifting sanctions against the country. It said it had made various goodwill gestures but the US was still following an ""outdated acting script"" and jeopardising any progress. North Korea remains under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. South Korea says it has caught three companies importing coal and iron from North Korea in breach of UN sanctions. The US wants full nuclear disarmament before sanctions on the North can be lifted. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un agreed in June to work towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula. But the details of that process remain vague - North Korea did not commit to unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons. Last week,a leaked UN report said the country had not stopped building weapons- which prompted the US to call on the international community to keep enforcing sanctions. 'Waiting to see a boiled egg hatch' North Korea's foreign ministry cited various conciliatory moves it said the country had made: halting missile tests,the return of the remains of US soldierskilled in the 1950-53 Korean War and the dismantling of a nuclear site. It said the US was clinging to an old script that ""all previous administrations have all tried and failed"". Kim Jong-un strips to his vest in heatwave Sons receive father's Korean War dog tag Searching for the father they barely knew It also accused US officials of ""going against the intention of President Trump"" by ""making baseless allegations"" and ""desperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure"". It's a long way from handshake to denuclearisation It said ""expecting any result, while insulting the dialogue partner"" was a ""foolish act that amounts to waiting to see a boiled egg hatch out"". Earlier this week,North Korea's foreign minister called US actions ""alarming"". And last month,North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tacticsin the negotiations. Pyongyang's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho is currently on a visit to Iran where President Hassan Rouhani warned the US could not be trusted after Tehran's experience of having the Trump administration tear up an Obama-era deal to ease sanctions. According to Iranian media, Mr Ri said his country would seek to retain its nuclear know-how for when the US would revert to a more aggressive position against Pyongyang. ""Since we know that the US will never give up its hostile policy toward us, we will hold onto our nuclear knowledge,"" he was quoted as saying by local media. Top diplomats from the US have strongly questioned the North's commitment to denuclearisation. National security adviser John Bolton said earlier this week North Korea had not begun the progress, while the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Washington was ""not willing to wait for too long"" for the North. Deciphering what happened in the Singapore summit Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was important to maintain ""diplomatic and economic pressure"" on North Korea. This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? Seoul's customs office said the latest North Korean coal and iron imports had first been shipped to Russia to disguise their origins. It is thought the three companies involved were hoping to make a large profit, as the price of North Korean products fell after the introduction of the UN sanctions. The UN has previously responded to ships violating the sanctionsby issuing them with a ban on visiting any global port. Andray Abrahamian, a North Korean specialist at Australia's Griffith University, said neither the US or North Korea seemed clear on what was the fair way to proceed. ""Nor is either side able yet to articulate what the end state of a peace regime will look like either,"" he added. ""I think both are afraid that articulating it is a set-up for a loss. We need some kind of simultaneous concession on both sides to get this process moving again."" Peter Ward, a writer for NK News, told the BBC: ""It is interesting that they are accusing members of the administration of going against the wishes of President Trump. It looks like they are trying to sow discord inside the administration and push for greater compromise. ""They probably want another summit, and would like Trump actively involved in the process.""

"""We'll be there for you..."" It's been 14 years since Friends ended, but we love Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe as much as always. The sitcom has beaten recent releases to top a list of the UK's most popular shows on paid-for streaming services. Netflix UK added Friends in January and twice as many episodes were streamed in the first three months of 2018 than its nearest rival, Amazon's The Grand Tour. Services like Netflix and Amazon don't publish viewer figures, but this data has been released by TV watchdog Ofcom. The list inOfcom's Media Nations report,external, based on a survey of 2,500 viewers, ranks the most-watched programmes on subscription streaming services. Although Netflix is pumping huge sums into its original programming - spending about $6.8bn (Â£5.3bn) this year alone - a show that ran from 1994-2004 has come out on top. The popularity of Friends probably has something to do with many fans binge viewing after 234 episodes were added to Netflix UK at the start of the year. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video & Now TV, January-March 2018. Source: GfK/Ofcom While many Friends fans were delighted when it arrived on Netflix UK, it sparked a debate after some people found parts of the humour were now unpalatable. Still Friends? The trouble with old sitcoms Friends' baby Emma twins are now 16 and are going to Hollywood Writer Rebecca Reidtold BBC Radio 5 live in Januaryshe ""couldn't believe how badly it has aged"". ""The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian,"" she said. ""The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."" She did acknowledge, however, that ""she did sort of love it"". There is still huge interest in the show, and Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel, recently saidshe ""fantasises"" about the show being brought back. As well as being on Netflix, the show is broadcast on Comedy Central daily in the UK. The channel has also enjoyed success with FriendsFest - a live touring event where fans can walk into recreations of Central Perk and the characters' apartments. Tickets have sold out in four of the six cities it is visiting this summer. We went to FriendsFest in Manchester to ask fans why the show still appeals. Sue Kemp, 48, from Liverpool, has been watching since the first episode, and daughter Rose, 21, is now a big fan too. ""Even my younger daughter watches it as well and she's 15, and she finds it just as funny as I do and I'm nearly 50,"" Sue says. ""It's good fun, it's light-hearted, it makes you feel good. You can easily watch two or three episodes a night. Come in from work, cook the tea, put Friends on."" Rose has been bingeing on the show since it appeared on Netflix at the start of the year. ""I've watched it start to finish twice. Maybe three times,"" she says. Should it ever return? ""I'd love to see a sequel,"" she says. ""Even just a movie catching up with them where they are now. Did Ross and Rachel ever really get together and live together? Did Monica and Chandler last?"" For sisters Cara Templeman (left, in the recreated Central Perk) and Jamie Sutcliffe, from Halifax, watching the show reminds them of when they were growing up. ""The jokes are still funny now. We were probably 10 or 11 when we first watched it,"" says Cara, 29. Jamie, 27, adds: ""A lot of the jokes probably went over our heads when we first watched it but now you watch it back and you find new things funny that you didn't find funny the first time."" Her sister continues: ""It's not offensive or anything like that is it? Sometimes you watch old programmes and you think, ooh, that wouldn't work now. There's not much in it like that."" Jamie says she recently watched all the episodes again to educate her husband. ""When it came on Netflix. I was like, 'Right, start to finish, we're watching it.' So we did, and he got into it. ""It only took us just over a month. I've just finished my PhD so I needed some wind-down time!"" Husband and wife Ben and Sarah Sloan, from Bolton (pictured in replicas of Joey and Chandler's chairs) can relate to different things as they've got older. ""Chandler's sarcasm and the stuff Ross gets himself into - I see myself getting into those situations sometimes,"" says Ben, 34. Sarah, 33, adds: ""I've read a lot lately about how it doesn't appeal to millennials, but we are millennials, I think. I love it just as much now as I did when I was younger, but now I see different things that I find funny. ""Now we're married and have kids there are other things we appreciate. As we've got older and they've got older we can understand the stresses and things, and how it's brought to a humorous light."" The couple mainly watch on Comedy Central. ""There's been this period in the last few years where it's always on the telly when you turn it on,"" Sarah says.

"The budget retailer Poundworld faces an uncertain future after falling into administration. Chains including House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and Mothercare, have announced they are closing branches. But what kinds of shops and leisure outlets are increasing and declining most across Britain? If you want to get a haircut or shave, go for a workout, drink a coffee or eat a pizza (either at home or in a restaurant), times are good. Outlets offering these services are among the fastest-growing consumer premises in Britain, according to a survey by the Local Data Company. But pubs, banks, travel agents, post offices and newsagents are becoming more of a rarity. High street crisis forces hundreds of closures Five things to do with empty retail space 10 high street stores of 1976 that have disappeared Despite overall sales rising considerably in May, British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has warned that conditions remain ""extremely challenging"" for shops, with margins tight and competition intense. So, here are the types of premises - selling goods and/or services - apparently doing best at the moment (the net increase shows how many more premises opened than closed during the year): The Office for National Statistics says British online sales increased to 17.3% of all retailing in the year to April, from 16.1% the previous year. So, it's little surprise that businesses providing services and goods that would be hard or impossible to supply over the internet - beauty treatments, tattooing, cups of coffee, and so on - have taken over hundreds of premises. Retailers, on the other hand, face ""significant head winds"" - includingincreases in the National Living Wageand rising costs in sourcing goods, with the decline in value of the pound - says Richard Lim, chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. Meanwhile, consumers are looking for ""low costs and convenience"", leading them to online shopping for many goods, a trend, he says, that will ""only accelerate"", potentially damaging High Streets. Here are the retail/service sectors that lost the most premises last year (the net decrease shows how many more closed than opened): The pubs figure roughly tallies with Campaign for Real Ale data suggesting they are closing at the rate of two a day. It blames high tax rates on alcohol, saying they cause more people to drink at home. But the Office for National Statistics also reports theproportion of the population who drink has shrunk.,external And a parliamentary report earlier this year described bank closures as""seemingly remorseless"",external, saying decreased use of cheques and more payments being made electronically had played their part. Likewise, sales of actual physical newspapers have fallen, as has the number of people smoking, hitting newsagents. And the Association of British Travel Agents found that83% of people used websites to book breaks last year,external- up from 76% in 2016.

"Department stores were once the main attraction on many High Streets, but these days shoppers appear increasingly able to resist their charms. House of Fraser has just announcedit intends to close 31 shops, affecting 6,000 jobs, as part of a rescue deal. Debenhams is planning to shut storesas profits fall- and BHS spectacularly collapsed in 2016, putting 11,000 people out of work. Yet some chains continue to prosper, so where have the weaker performers gone wrong? House of Fraser to close 31 stores Debenhams reviews 10 stores for closure Can department stores survive? Diane Wehrle of market research firm Springboard says the worst department stores ""haven't changed in 10, maybe 20 years"". This is because they have not invested enough in upgrading their shop floors, product ranges or online offerings. ""As we have had access to global products our standards as consumers have increased - we can also buy anything we want online,"" she says. ""So if we are to go shopping we need to have a good experience, excitement and entertainment. A lot of today's department stores don't supply that."" Ms Wehrle adds that their unique selling point - offering a host of different brands under the same roof - has also been weakened in the internet age. We are buying more of our clothes from fast fashion retailers like Primark Many of today's ailing department stores focus on fashion - but they may not have the right merchandise, says Stephen Springham, head of retail insights at Knight Frank. ""It's a part of the problem at Debenhams which hasn't kept up with the times,"" he says. ""The range isn't terrible but it's a very competitive market and being not terrible is not good enough."" Meanwhile, Mr Springham says most of House of Fraser's goods are ""other brands you can buy somewhere else"", while their in-house brands are not particularly strong: ""There isn't that point of difference."" It comes as more shoppers, both young and old, are buying their clothes from nimbler ""fast fashion"" retailers such as Asos, Primark and Zara that can also beat them on price. As sales have fallen, some department store groups have turned to discounting in a bid to keep tills ringing. But Ms Wehrle says that approach has not worked and has become a ""vicious circle"". ""Others do it too so you have to go lower, and it becomes a race to the bottom."" This squeezes margins, leaving department stores with even less to spend on improving their shops. Some House of Fraser stores are more modern than others Like other struggling high street retailers, some department store groups have too many underperforming shops and need to downsize. Debenhams, which has 176 UK stores, has said it could close 10 outlets and is in talks with landlords about reducing space at 30 more. And House of Fraser, which had 59 stores, is now planning to close more than half of them. Downsizing isn't easy, however. Many of the biggest department stores are locked in very long leases of ""30, 40, even 50 years"", says Mr Springham. Making matters worse, some of the buildings housing them are ill configured for a modern retail experience, he added. ""Some of them are more than 100 years old and quite higgledy-piggledy â¦ they might not have a centralised escalator. If you built them from scratch you wouldn't build them that way."" Selfridges reported strong sales last year These problems come amid a general slowdown on the High Street linked to weaker consumer confidence, online competition and rising overheads such as a higher minimum wage. But Ms Wehrle believes struggling department stores could have weathered the storm better: ""If a retailer blames the demise of their business on these pressures alone they are probably hanging by a thread."" She points to John Lewis as an example of a group that has adapted well in changing times by ramping up its online presence and investing in its store experience. Selfridges and Harrods, which target well-heeled shoppers, many of them from abroad, are also doing well. For the year to January, sales at Selfridges rose 16% to Â£1.6bn, while Harrods posted a 23% surge to Â£2.1bn.

"The budget retailer Poundworld faces an uncertain future after falling into administration. Chains including House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and Mothercare, have announced they are closing branches. But what kinds of shops and leisure outlets are increasing and declining most across Britain? If you want to get a haircut or shave, go for a workout, drink a coffee or eat a pizza (either at home or in a restaurant), times are good. Outlets offering these services are among the fastest-growing consumer premises in Britain, according to a survey by the Local Data Company. But pubs, banks, travel agents, post offices and newsagents are becoming more of a rarity. High street crisis forces hundreds of closures Five things to do with empty retail space 10 high street stores of 1976 that have disappeared Despite overall sales rising considerably in May, British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has warned that conditions remain ""extremely challenging"" for shops, with margins tight and competition intense. So, here are the types of premises - selling goods and/or services - apparently doing best at the moment (the net increase shows how many more premises opened than closed during the year): The Office for National Statistics says British online sales increased to 17.3% of all retailing in the year to April, from 16.1% the previous year. So, it's little surprise that businesses providing services and goods that would be hard or impossible to supply over the internet - beauty treatments, tattooing, cups of coffee, and so on - have taken over hundreds of premises. Retailers, on the other hand, face ""significant head winds"" - includingincreases in the National Living Wageand rising costs in sourcing goods, with the decline in value of the pound - says Richard Lim, chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. Meanwhile, consumers are looking for ""low costs and convenience"", leading them to online shopping for many goods, a trend, he says, that will ""only accelerate"", potentially damaging High Streets. Here are the retail/service sectors that lost the most premises last year (the net decrease shows how many more closed than opened): The pubs figure roughly tallies with Campaign for Real Ale data suggesting they are closing at the rate of two a day. It blames high tax rates on alcohol, saying they cause more people to drink at home. But the Office for National Statistics also reports theproportion of the population who drink has shrunk.,external And a parliamentary report earlier this year described bank closures as""seemingly remorseless"",external, saying decreased use of cheques and more payments being made electronically had played their part. Likewise, sales of actual physical newspapers have fallen, as has the number of people smoking, hitting newsagents. And the Association of British Travel Agents found that83% of people used websites to book breaks last year,external- up from 76% in 2016. Shops and leisure operators are dealing with an ""unprecedented"" range of challenges, including internet competition, business rate increases and lifestyle changes, says Mr Lim. ""The question,"" he adds, ""is how the strongest brands deal with what's happening.""

"After losing its battle to stay afloat, department store chain House of Fraser has been snapped up by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. The move came within hours of the retailer's announcement that it was appointing administrators. But it is unclear how much of the business will survive. It's a worrying time for House of Fraser's 17,500 employees, including 11,500 concession staff. So what went wrong for the retailer? New technology has had a disruptive influence on the High Street in general, with digital retailers such as Amazon dealing a savage blow to traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. But House of Fraser was slow to grasp the extent of the change, failing to respond quickly enough with its own internet offer. As far back as 2004,,externalthe chain was being described by the Interactive Media in Retail Group, a trade body, as one of the ""online laggards"" that ""failed to embrace internet trading opportunities"". It wasn't until last year that it announced a major upgrade of its online platform. By then, sales through the internet had grown to 20% of its business. House of Fraser bought by Sports Direct Why we no longer love dept stores The story of the House of Fraser Which High Street shops are opening and closing? However, the Â£25m that it spent on its digital revamp was just half the amount that online retailer Asos invested in technology in the same year. Meanwhile, John Lewis outstripped them both with a whopping Â£500m investment in e-commerce. Despite the rise of the internet, traditional department stores are not automatically doomed. But people do need a reason to visit them, whether physically or virtually. Over the years, House of Fraser has gobbled up lots of smaller department store concerns, such as Army & Navy, Dickins & Jones and DH Evans. In the process, it did a lot to kill off the diversity of High Streets up and down the UK, while failing to replace those defunct brands with a distinctive identity of its own. As a result, the average House of Fraser store was just that - average. With no unique selling point of its own, it lacked the pulling power it needed to fend off rivals. Worse still, a lot of the goods sold within were not even House of Fraser's: they were being hawked by more than 600 third-party concession owners. The chain's own brand was taking a back seat. When it embarked on its rescue plan, House of Fraser had 59 department stores in the UK. That's broadly comparable with John Lewis and a lot less than Debenhams, but those two retailers have been more successful than House of Fraser at reinventing themselves and staying relevant in a crowded marketplace. Retail analysts reckon the chain should have slimmed down its portfolio a long time ago. Instead, it spent years acquiring more stores, often with expensive legacy lease arrangements. The last 15 years have been a turbulent era for the group: it changed hands twice and became a bid target a number of times. Amid all the takeovers and fears of takeovers, it was never clear what House of Fraser's long-term strategy was. The uncertainty began in 2003, when Scottish billionaire Tom Hunter launched an unsuccessful hostile bid. Other attempted takeovers ensued until in 2006, it was sold to a consortium led by Iceland's Baugur for Â£351m. There was yet more takeover talk in 2013, this time with French department store Galeries Lafayette. A year later, House of Fraser was sold to Chinese department store group Nanjing Xinjiekou, part of Sanpower, in a deal valued at about Â£480m. More recently, there's been much talk of a ""revolving door"" syndrome blighting the chain's management. When current chief executive Alex Williamson was hired in July last year after nine years at sporting firm Goodwood, his lack of retail experience raised eyebrows. Mr Williamson's predecessor, Nigel Oddy, had been in the job for less than two years when he resigned in November 2016, leaving the firm rudderless just before the crucial Christmas trading period. It was hoped that the company would be rescued by another Chinese company, C.banner, owner of toy store Hamleys. But the deal fell through at the last minute, sealing House of Fraser's fate. As it turned out, C.banner itself was not robust enough to save the ageing High Street stalwart. The Hong Kong-listed firm had planned to fund the deal by issuing new shares. But when its share price fell 70% in two months, it was forced to pull the share placing, which it said had become ""impracticable and inadvisable"". As a result, there was nothing to stop House of Fraser falling into administration, with Mike Ashley ultimately stepping in to buy up the chain.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made a number of changes to crackdown on US migrant policy A federal judge has ordered a mother and her daughter to be flown back to the United States, after learning they had been deported mid-appeal. The two were being represented in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who said they had fled ""extreme sexual and gang violence"". The judge said it was unacceptable they had been removed during their appeal. He reportedly also said Attorney General Jeff Sessions could be held in contempt of court for the deportation. Mr Sessions introduced tighter immigration rules in June andvictims of domestic abuse and gang violence no longer generally qualify for US asylum. The mother and daughter were part of a case filed by the ACLU and the Centre for Gender and Refugee Studies on behalf of 12 mothers and children who said they had fled violence but were at risk of deportation. The government had pledged not to deport anyone in the case before Friday at the earliest, the ACLU said. Inside the chaos to reunite families My life trapped in an American city Separation protests sweep the US But the ACLU said they had learned during Thursday's emergency hearing that the mother and daughter had already been put on a flight back to El Salvador by US authorities. Washington DC District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan said that it was unacceptable that people claiming asylum had been removed while lawyers argued their case. Describing the situation as ""outrageous"", he ordered the pair be returned immediately, according to reports. An official from the Department of Homeland Security told the Reuters agency that the agency had worked to comply with the court's order. ""Upon arrival in El Salvador, the plaintiffs did not disembark and are currently en route back to the United States,"" the department said in an emailed statement. The mother and daughter are said to have arrived back in Texas, where they were being held, by Thursday night. According to the ACLU, hundreds of migrant children remain separated from their parents after a policy change According to the lawsuit, the migrant mother, known under the alias ""Carmen"", came to the US with her young daughter after two decades of sexual abuse from her husband and death threats from a local gang in her native El Salvador. But their case was halted when officers found they did not have a ""credible fear of persecution"". The case comes at a time when US migrant policy remains firmly under the spotlight after it emerged in June that migrant children were being separated from their families at the US border. The policy led to widespread outrage and condemnation. Mr Trump signed an executive order seeking to end the policy, but more than 500 children remained apart from their families as of Thursday.

"He's been described as a wily chain-smoking deal-maker who made his start in business selling computers by a toilet. But China's Yuan Yafei, a former government official, has come a long way since then. Today he is the Chinese billionaire who holds the fate of 17,500 House of Fraser workers in his hands. Mr Yuan's Sanpower Group, a firm he founded in 1993, snapped up 89% of a struggling House of Fraser in 2014. The self-made Chinese tycoon had grand plans to save the struggling 169-year-old retail chain and turn it into a global entity. Instead, the 54-year-old is now watching his famous department chain go into administration, while 31 stores have already been earmarked for closure. This video can not be played Why is House of Fraser failing? Based in eastern Nanjing in China's Jiangsu province, Sanpower Group is Mr Yuan's private multi-national conglomerate with interests ranging from pharmaceuticals to real estate and retail. Like so many big opaque Chinese conglomerates, though, it owns or has large shareholdings in several public firms at home and abroad, including Shenzhen-listed Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store - one of the oldest department store businesses on mainland China. House of Fraser store closures to go ahead House of Fraser rescue deal falls through Hamleys owner 'eyes House of Fraser deal' When Mr Yuan acquired a cash-strapped House of Fraser in 2014 he thought the deal would help him expand his existing retail interests. He admired its long history, its staunchly British background, and its high-street retail reputation. He promised to help revive the firm with investments, and wanted to see it get on top of its debt. The tycoon also had grand plans for the House of Fraser brand in China, envisaging about 50 ""Oriental Fraser"" stores across the country. And he thought he could push the UK chain out as far afield as Russia. In February this year, as House of Fraser's financial worries in the UK continued, Mr Yuan seemed confident, telling the BBC's Robin Branthe still had big expansion plans for the chain in China. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Toys R Us UK goes into administration Reality Check: Which shops are opening and closing? But to-date, as old-fashioned bricks and mortar stores continue to struggle against the global boom in online shopping, just two Oriental Fraser stores have been launched, and there's no word on Russia. Meanwhile, Nanjing Xinjiekou, the Sanpower-controlled entity that actually owns House of Fraser, has seen its shares lose almost 70% in the year-to-date. More complicated still is that earlier this month, a Beijing court froze for three years the 27% of Nanjing Xinjiekou shares that are owned by Sanpower. There's also Mr Yuan's investment in Brookstone - a US novelty mall chain in the US - which has gone belly up. Earlier this year, the chain announced it was filing for bankruptcy and closing its more than 100 stores. And finally, there's a question around the overall health of Sanpower's finances. On 23 July, the Chinese giant asked the Shanghai Stock Exchange to put a halt on trading some of its bonds, citing worries over some trades. But rumours abound it's in much deeper trouble than that after a recent debt-fuelled buying spree. Just like the Chinese giants HNA and Anbang, Mr Yuan's Sanpower has in recent years scooped up (and, in some cases, spat out) international businesses with a vengeance - including Natali, the largest private healthcare firm in Israel, and US biotech firm Dendreon. Make no mistake, Mr Yuan is rich.His real time net worth is valued by Forbes at $1b,external. And it seems he spreads that money around. He's received lots of awards locally, including China's Charity Person of the Year and Brand China's Man of the Year, and his relationship with Prince William through a wildlife foundation is reasonably well documented. Yuan Yafei with Prince William at Kensington Palace in 2015 But with House of Fraser's debts mounting, would it be so surprising if the billionaire decided to just walk away? The most recent plan to try and save House of Fraser was for Nanjing Xinjiekou (the firm that's seen its stock slide nearly 70% this year), to sell up a 51% stake in the UK retail giant. But advanced talks to sell to tourist firm Wuji Wenhua fell through earlier this year.Then just last week, a deal to sell to C.banner, which owns the toy store Hamley's, fell over too. The very latest gossip on the street is that there may be three new prospective buyers for the famous High Street chain - and that if one comes through, House of Fraser and some staff might just be saved. What Mr Yuan might think about that, though, is anybody's guess. House of Fraser store closures to go ahead Reality Check: Which shops are opening and closing?

"Net migration targets should be scrapped after Brexit, the Confederation of British Industry says. Targets should be replaced with a system that ensures people coming to the UK make a positive contribution to the economy, the business group said. Schools and hospitals should receive extra funding where demand is increased by immigration, the CBI added. But the Home Office said it was committed to bringing net migration down to ""tens of thousands"". The contribution of EU workers to the UK economy was ""profoundly important and will be needed in the future"", after the free movement of EU citizens comes to an end as part of Brexit, the CBI said. It said EU citizens should be registered on arrival to the UK and restrict their visit to three months ""unless they can prove that they are working, studying or are self-sufficient"". It would be ""entirely unworkable"" to move EU nationals into the existing non-EU immigration system, which the CBI described as ""highly complex, time-consuming and expensive, particularly for small businesses"". European fruit pickers shun Britain Construction bodies warn of Brexit 'cliff edge' skills gap Carney: No-deal Brexit risk 'uncomfortably high' The CBI said immigration had been shown time and again to bring net economic benefits to the UK, yet people had legitimate concerns about the pressures immigration could have on public services and society. The answer was to shift away from numbers and instead to focus on who could benefit the UK. This need not just be high earners, but anyone who could contribute. There is an impetus to overhaul UK immigration policy after Brexit to make sure the system allows skilled people to come into the country from around the world, the CBI said. ""The stakes are high. Get it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the health service, pick food crops or deliver products to stores around the country,"" it added. ""We also risk harming our future as a global innovation hub, rooted in our longstanding ability to attract talented people the world over."" However, the Home Office said it had no plans to scrap immigration targets. The target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands was set by David Cameron in 2010. But the goal has never been met, with recent annual net migration to the UK at about 240,000. There is ""no consent in Britain for uncontrolled immigration"", the Home Office said. ""After we leave the EU, we will end free movement and put in place a system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK,"" the Home Office said. ""We are considering a range of options that will ensure that we are in control of our borders and managing migration, while continuing to attract and retain people who come here to work and bring significant benefits."" The government has asked the Migration Advisory Committee, a non-departmental public body, to assess the contribution that EU citizens make to the UK. The body has been talking to businesses, the NHS and universities, and is due to bring out a report in September.

"This video can not be played Everton signing Mina's three World Cup goals Everton, Fulham and Leicester all made big-money signings as the earliest transfer deadline in Premier League history came to life late in the day. However, the amount spent in the window by Premier League clubs fell for the first time in eight years, to Â£1.2bn. Tottenham and Manchester United made no signings on 9 August. Spurs became the first Premier League club to not make a summer signing since the current transfer window system was adopted in 2003. The deadline was moved from 31 August to the day before the Premier League season starts after a vote by clubs. Listen: Football Daily - the big transfer deadline day pod Yerry Mina's Â£27m move to Evertonfrom Barcelona was the day's big transfer. The deadline also applied to English Football League clubs - although they can still sign free agents and loan players until 31 August. Premier League and EFL clubs voted - although not unanimously - to close the transfer market earlier this season to avoid disruption to the opening weeks of the season. However, it was only introduced in England, with Spanish, German, French and Scottish clubs able to sign players until the end of the month. Italy has a deadline of Friday, 17 August - the day before Serie A starts. Players could still leave the Premier League - with Chelsea's Eden Hazard a reported target for Spanish giants Real Madrid, although the Blues would then not be able to sign a replacement. Deadline day as it happened If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please clickhere,externalto vote. As well as the earlier-than-usual date, the deadline also closed earlier in the day - 17:00 BST compared to the usual 23:00. It looked as if this was going to be the quietest final day since the window was introduced in 2003 - with only eight signings confirmed by Premier League clubs before 17:00. The highest-profile deal at that stage was midfielder Mateo Kovacic joining Chelsea on loan from Real Madrid - with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtoisgoing the other way permanently. But clubs had another two hours after the deadline to finalise paperwork - during which Everton signed Colombia defender Mina and midfielder Andre Gomes on loan from Barcelona - having signed free agent Bernard earlier in the day. The Toffees announced the loan signing of Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma the following day. Fulham announced five players, all after the deadline- Marseille midfielder Andre-Frank Anguissa in a Â£22.3m deal, Bristol City left-back Joe Bryan for Â£6m and Sergio Rico, Luciano Vietto and Timothy Fosu-Mensah on loan. That made them the first promoted team ever to spend over Â£100m in the summer. AndLeicester City confirmed the signingof Freiburg and Turkey defender Caglar Soyuncu, in a deal thought to be worth up to Â£19m. Earlier on, they had bought defender Filip Benkovic from Dinamo Zagreb for a reported Â£13m. The top 10 Premier League signings of the transfer window (based on initial transfer fees) Check out all the deadline day moves here Some other moves included Danny Ings joining Southampton from Liverpool on a loan which will become permanent next summer, Jordan Ayew moving to Crystal Palace from Swansea for a season and West Ham signing Arsenal striker Lucas Perez and Fiorentina midfielder Carlos Sanchez. This video can not be played Tottenham will be competitive - Pochettino Six clubs did not sign anybody on Thursday. Tottenham arereported,externalto be the first Premier League club to not sign a single player in a summer transfer window, although bossMauricio Pochettino said he was not disappointed,with only two youngsters leaving the club. ""It's difficult to understand for people that Tottenham didn't sign or sell a player, but sometimes in football you need to behave differently and we're happy with our squad,"" he said. Manchester United only signed three players all summer - all by early July. But they did also try to sign a centre-back and manager Jose Mourinho said on Sunday they faced a ""difficult season"" if they could not sign anyone else. They had been linked with Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld, Leicester's Harry Maguire and Bayern Munich's Jerome Boateng over the summer. And the Red Devils made a dramatic late approach for Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin - but he is now expected to sign a new deal with the Spanish club. Spurs were one of 14 clubs to vote for the earlier deadline last September, with United voting against it. Arsenal and Liverpool were among the other clubs not to sign anybody - but they were not expected to, having each made several signings earlier this summer. Club-by-club guide to Premier League transfers Figures released by Deloitte say summer spending dropped by Â£200m from last year's record of Â£1.4bn - and deadline-day spending was only just over half the 2017 total - Â£110m, down from Â£210m. But Premier League clubs spent a record Â£880m to bring in players from foreign leagues - compared to Â£770m last summer. That was 72% of all money spent by English top-flight clubs - last year's figure was 54%. Tim Bridge, director in the sports business group at Deloitte, said: ""Premier League clubs' gross player transfer expenditure of Â£1.2bn continues to demonstrate the sheer purchasing power of the most commercially successful football league in the world. ""With Premier League clubs' aggregate revenues forecast to reach Â£5bn in 2018-19, clubs can well afford to significantly invest in on-pitch talent in the quest for both success and survival."" Some other findings included: The next highest spending league is Serie A, with a reported gross spend of about Â£910m (including Â£99m Cristiano Ronaldo), followed by La Liga (Â£680m), the Bundesliga (Â£400m) and Ligue 1 (Â£350m) - but none of their windows have closed yet Championship clubs spent Â£155m on transfers - a decrease from the Â£195m spent last summer The Premier League's highest-spending clubs were Liverpool (Â£165m), Chelsea (Â£120m), Fulham (Â£105m) and Leicester City (Â£100m) Only three clubs received more transfer fees than they spent - Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and Watford * this year's figure of 25 excludes Everton's signing of Kurt Zouma which they announced on Friday The flurry of late deals took deadline day above last year's total of 17 transfers - to 26 (including Zouma's Everton move on Friday), the highest amount since 2013 - but the total number of transfers in the window fell for the fifth year in a row. Until the late rush, it had appeared it was going to the the quietest summer deadline day in Premier League history. Football finance expert Rob Wilson of Sheffield Hallam University said: ""Clubs invested heavily last year when we saw almost Â£1.5bn being spent. Without a new TV deal that increases the amount of cash available, this window was always due to plateau. ""That, plus excessive fees being quoted, has probably restricted what some clubs are prepared to pay. Manchester United, for example, have spent much more modestly and would normally contribute to the overall total. I suspect that is due to clubs increasing their prices as the world's richest club came knocking and United simply refused to be held to ransom."" Wilson thinks Neymar's Â£200m world record move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain last summer helped change the transfer market. ""It does seem to have shifted the market up, especially after Philippe Coutinho moved for Â£140m+ from Liverpool to Barcelona. It's meant fees in general have essentially doubled from what would have been expected before the last TV deal. It's indicative of fewer signings but higher fees too."" The rise in prices is backed up by the transfer fees previously paid for this summer's top 10 Premier League signings, with none of them costing more than Â£13m when they were last signed.

"Struggling department store chain House of Fraser has set a deadline of 20 August to secure fresh funding. The company is planning to close 31 of its 59 shops in January, but is also seeking fresh investment to survive. House of Fraser told the Luxembourg stock exchange,externalthat ""discussions continue"" with potential investors. The talks are ""focused on concluding as quickly as possible to enable receipt of an investment required by no later than 20 August 2018"". That is the date when the department store business needs to make payments to its concession customers. However, an agreement could be reached far sooner than that. House of Fraser employs 17,500 people - 6,000 directly and 11,500 concession staff. Who is House of Fraser's Yuan Yafei? House of Fraser store closures to go ahead In the statement in Luxembourg, where it has bond investors, House of Fraser said it would provide further updates ""as and when appropriate"". ""House of Fraser thanks all of its employees, suppliers and other stakeholders for their ongoing support,"" the statement said. Sky News reported,externalthat bidders had been told to submit their final offers on Thursday morning. Potential suitors for the chain include Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mills whose retail empire also includes Peacocks, Jane Norman, Austin Reed and Jaeger. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, also approached the chain in July over a potential investment deal. The investment fund Alteri, an offshoot of US hedge fund Apollo, is also said to be interested. In JuneHouse of Fraser announced its plan to shut storesas part of a restructuring deal agreed with its Chinese owners Nanjing Cenbest - also known as Nanjing Xinjiekou - to sell a 51% stake to the Chinese owner of Hamley's, C.banner. But earlier this month, C.banner pulledout of the dealto take the stake in the 169-year-old department store chain, leaving it and its creditors to seek alternative sources of finance. Thestore closure plan was almost derailed by a row with landlordswho had argued slashing rents on remaining stores was unfair to them. But that dispute was resolved earlier this month. More than 6,000 jobs - 2,000 from House of Fraser and 4,000 brand and concession roles - will be lost as a result of the restructuring, the company has said. Who is House of Fraser's Yuan Yafei?

"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has agreed to buy the House of Fraser department store chain for Â£90m. The deal was announced just hours after the 169-year-old chain went into administration when talks with its creditors failed to reach an agreement. Mr Ashley said his plan was to turn the 59-store chain in to the ""Harrods of the High Street"". It employs 16,000, 5,900 directly and 10,100 in concessions. Administrators said jobs could be ""preserved"". While some stores did not open on time on Friday, initial problems with the website were resolved. There were reports, though, that gift cards were not being accepted. Sports Direct said in a statement:,external""The group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business."" Sports Direct already held an 11% stake in the department store chain, which had been intending to close 31 shops under a now-abandoned restructuring plan. House of Fraser's administrators, from accountants EY, said the department store chain had been in ""a race against time to secure sufficient funding to secure its future"" ever since the Chinese firmC.banner pulled out of a rescue dealearlier this month. House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Which High Street shops are opening and closing? The Scottish retail empire struggling to fight back Before Friday's deal was announced, 6,000 roles were to have been lost. Alan Hudson, one of the four administrators from accountants EY, said the Sports Direct deal ""preserves as many of the jobs of House of Fraser's employees as possible"". ""We hope that this [deal] will give the business the stable financial platform that it requires to flourish in the current retail environment"". But union officials at Unite said staff were entering ""a period of great uncertainty and worry"". Unite regional officer Scott Lennon said: ""Sports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope that its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser."" Mike Ashley already held an 11% stake in House of Fraser Mr Ashley founded the 750-strong sports fashion chain Sports Direct in 1982.  Among the brands it owns are Slazenger, Karrimor, and the sports retailer Lillywhites. It has also encountered controversy. Areport by the Business, Innovation and Skills committeein 2016 concluded that the company did not treat its workers like humans, but Sports Direct said its policy was to treat all people with respect. He has a varied portfolio of investments, including in department store Debenhams and the retailer French Connection. In addition, he owns the lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, as well as the clothing chain Flannels, which sells brands such as Burberry London, Fendi and Sophia Webster. Mr Ashley is also the owner of Newcastle United, although he attempted to sell the football club earlier this year. Chinese firm C.banner had been poised to invest in the store after it agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors. This would have closed 31 stores and put 6,000 jobs at risk. But it could not raise the financing, leaving House of Fraser seeking new investment. On Thursday, House of Fraser had indicated time was running out whenit said it wanted to secure financing by 20 August. This was the date when concessions in the stores were scheduled to be paid. As well as problems with its owners, the chain hadtoo many stores, was slow to develop its internet shopping capability and failed to entice enough shoppers. More may stay open. Mr Ashley said: ""We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible."" ""My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street,"" he said, indicating a move upmarket. ""This is a massive step forward and further enhances our strategy of elevation across the group. This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector,"" he added. There had been speculation he might take the opportunity to expand the Sports Direct chain, which he has previously said he wants to transform into ""the Selfridges of sport"". Analysts said he would need to spend more money.  Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""To give House of Fraser the best chance of survival, Sports Direct and its owner Mike Ashley must make drastic changes to both its product proposition and store environment to entice shoppers back."" Kate Hardcastle, from the retail consultancy Insight with Passion, told the BBC a move downmarket was more likely. ""This is a big move and I'm sure lots of people will be breathing a slight sigh of relief that the name House of Fraser isn't disappearing from the High Street altogether,"" she said. ""However, I can't imagine that the business or indeed its offer are going to be similar to that people know or recognise as House of Fraser - this is someone who deals very much in the discount market."" House of Fraser has two main types of relationships with its suppliers: wholesalers, who get paid whether or not their stock is sold, or concession holders, who are paid after their items are sold. Nigel Lugg, group executive chairman of Prominent Europe, which supplies Chester Barrie menswear to House of Fraser, said it was ""good news"" that the business had been saved. But, he said, suppliers would have hoped the business would avoid administration, so they could be paid in full. ""I can't see the suppliers getting a lot of money out of the system,"" Mr Lugg told the BBC, adding suppliers often received 2p to 3p in the pound in cases of administration. His business would be fine but, he said, ""it could impact into other UK suppliers"". ""There is a lot of money trapped in the system,"" Mr Lugg said. Mr Ashley referred to some suppliers when he announced the deal. He said: ""It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands.""

"Boris Johnson's remarks about Muslim women wearing the burka were ""inflammatory and divisive"", the UK's equalities watchdog says. The former foreign secretary said people in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission said his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"". Dozens of complaints to the Tory Party are being investigated but Mr Johnson has stood by his remarks. Some Conservatives are unhappy at the party's response, and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC: ""My general view is I don't think that an internal party system should be there to shut down MPs when they speak."" Comedian Rowan Atkinson expressed support for Mr Johnson ina letter to the Times newspaper,external, saying ""no apology is required"" for ridiculing religion. But one of Mr Johnson's critics, Conservative Muslim Forum founder Lord Sheikh, told BBC Newsnight he received ""vile"" Islamophobic messages after calling for him to be thrown out of the Conservative Party. Why some Muslim women wear the veil Boris Johnson's burka remark 'insulting' The equalities commission is understood to have received a complaint from a member of the public about Mr Johnson's comments. Its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: ""The effectiveness of our democratic society depends on freedom of expression, and the expression of offensive and intolerant opinions is generally not unlawful. ""Boris Johnson's use of language in this instance, which risks dehumanising and vilifying Muslim women, is inflammatory and divisive. Political figures should lead by example, conducting debates in a responsible manner, and language such as this can inhibit legitimate dialogue."" Lord Sheikhsaid earlier this week that Mr Johnson should be kicked out of the partyfor his remarks. And speaking to Newsnight on Thursday, he added that in his view Mr Johnson had ""let the genie out of the bottle"" by inflaming tensions with his comments. Out of 75 emails he had since received about the issue, 15 were complimentary while the rest included ""offensive language"" and ""horrible things, obscene things, about the Prophet Muhammad"", Lord Sheikh told the BBC. The complaints to the Conservative Party against Mr Johnson are being looked at by an internal party team, which will decide whether any should be examined by an independent panel. Ultimately complaints can end up with the party's board, which has powers that include suspension or expulsion. This video can not be played Lord Sheikh: ""Boris Johnson has let the genie out of the bottle"" A source close to Mr Johnson offered no comment on the move while a Tory spokesman said: ""The code of conduct process is strictly confidential."" But Blackadder and Mr Bean creator Atkinson told the Times: ""I do think that Boris Johnson's joke about wearers of the burka resembling letterboxes is a pretty good one. ""All jokes about religion cause offence, so it's pointless apologising for them."" The comedian and comedy writerhas previously campaigned against legislation,externalthat made it an offence to incite religious hatred on the basis that it could stifle freedom of speech. Ex-Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell has also said Mr Johnson should not have to apologise. He said Mr Johnson had ""expressed himself in quite colourful language, but he hasn't committed any offence and we need to be very careful about our handling of this because we believe in free speech in this country"". The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. The Conservative Muslim Forum and the Muslim Council of Britain had already raised concerns before Mr Johnson's article. Protesters gathered in Mr Johnson's constituency calling for his resignation. One hundred Muslim women who wear the niqab or burka have signed a letter to Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, calling on him to withdraw the Conservative whip from Mr Johnson - whose Uxbridge constituency was targeted by around 30 protesters calling for his resignation - and launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. ""We are not forced to make these clothing choices, nor are we oppressed,"" the women wrote in their letter, which has been issued to the media by the Muslim Council of Britain.

"Protestors gathered outside the Supreme Court in San Jose this week to demand change Costa Rica's Supreme Court has ruled that the country's same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional and discriminatory. The court ruling gives the country's legislators a time limit of 18 months to change the current law. The president welcomed the ruling, saying he wants to guarantee ""no person will face discrimination for their sexual orientation"". However many lawmakers are evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage. A Supreme Court judge, Fernando Castillo, told a press conference on Wednesday that the ban will automatically cease to legally exist in 18 months, even if no action is taken by the legislature. The legislative chamber has 57 seats - 14 of which are held by evangelical members. Costa Rica country profile 'People hate us, we might move to Spain' Preacher vs Progressive in Costa Rica poll Late Wednesday's ruling complies witha judgement issued in January by the Inter-American Human Rights Courtthat said same-sex marriage should be recognised by all of its signatory members. Enrique Sanchez, the country's first openly gay legislator, told AFP that he did not believe the assembly would work out a law change between themselves. He is a member of the Citizen Action Party, led by President Carlos Alvarado who came to power on a pro-LGBT platform. Carlos Alvarado won April's presidential run-off promising to defend same-sex rights President Alvarado is a former rock singer and novelist, who won the presidential run-off in Aprilfollowing a campaign where LGBT rights became a key issue.

"This video can not be played Deaths in Charlottesville were the culmination of months of protests by white supremacists The National Park Service (NPS) has granted officials permits for a white nationalist rally and counter-protests in Washington DC on 12 August. Jason Kessler, who organised last year's deadly ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, received approval for the event in June. But NPS waited to issue the permit before finalising a security plan. The ""Unite the Right 2"" rally will be held near the White House and about 400 people are expected to attend. Charlottesville remembered: 'A battle for the soul of America' It comes on the first anniversary of last year's rally, which led to the death of one counter-protester. This video can not be played Susan Bro tells the BBC: ""Your life doesnât end just because someone you love dies"" ""Permits were issued this morning for Jason Kessler and ANSWER Coalition and will be posted on the National Park Service Freedom of Information Act website as soon as the [Freedom of Information Act] officer has reviewed them and applied any necessary redactions,"" said Mike Litterst, the chief of communications for the NPS, in a statement on Thursday. The event will take place in Lafayette Park which is adjacent to the White House. It allows for up to 400 participants, who say they plan to protest ""civil rights abuse in Charlottesville, VA/white civil rights rally"". Ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is one of the scheduled speakers. Torch-bearing white supremacists rallied at a Confederate statue in Virginia last year Speakers also include Patrick Little, Simon Roche, Kevin Cormier, Avi Horton, Corey Mahler and Tom Kawcyznki, according to the permit. Unlike last year, they are banned from holding a march or carrying open-flame torches, as they did in Virginia to protest against the removal of Confederate monuments. A reckoning in Charlottesville Why Trump's reactions shouldn't surprise us Heavily armed protesters clashed with counter-protesters last year in Virginia The group's website is advising participants to bring bodycams and US or Confederate flags, but not items like guns, pepper spray, shields or knives. Participants are also asked to ""not react with anger to anyone"". NPS has also granted permits for two counter-protests, including one for activist group ANSWER Coalition. Washington officials say they do not anticipate any violence unlike the events in Charlottesville Virginia's governor has declared a state of emergency as a safety precaution, but no events are scheduled over the weekend. Mr Kessler had sued the city after he was denied a permit to hold a second rally, but dropped the case last Friday. ""On Sunday we know that we have people coming to our city for the sole purpose of spewing hate,"" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. She added her condolences to the family of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who was killed last year after a neo-Nazi driver ploughed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters. Two Virginia State Police troopers also died when their helicopter crashed as they policed the event. Washington DC police have closed traffic in certain parts of the city ahead of the event, and are stepping up patrols as a precaution. 'Since when do we call a Nazi a good person?'

"MP Andrew Hastie with his own portrait of the Queen Australians have emailed MPs with dozens of requests for free portraits of the Queen, after the little-known entitlement was publicised this week. Under official rules, citizens may ask for ""nationhood"" material - things such as Australian flags, anthem recordings, and portraits of the head of state. One MP, Tim Watts, said most requests for images of the Queen were due to a case of ""excellent trolling"". It followed aVice story,externalthat had drawn wide attention to the entitlement. ""I can say before the story was published, I had received zero requests for portraits of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,"" Mr Watts told the ABC. ""The last 24 hours, I would say [I have received] about four dozen. I think 99% were tongue firmly in cheek."" Other lawmakers also noted the influx of requests, with some making light of it.

Mr Watts said it was more common to supply constituents with flags, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ensigns. ""Usually people request flags when they're representing Australia overseas for sport or school or community groups,"" he said. Australia is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with the Queen as its head of state. She is represented in Canberra by an appointed governor-general.

"On 12 August, the small, serene city of Charlottesville, Virginia will mark the anniversary of a deadly white nationalist rally that shocked the nation. The violence that day cost the life of a young counter-protester and scarred Charlottesville. An official report condemned city officials for failing to adequately prepare and police for standing by as confrontation turned to chaos. In the year since, some residents have attempted to reckon with the legacy of that weekend and the racial inequality that persists in the city. Others have sought to consign the violence of last summer to the past, in an effort to restore to Charlottesville a lost reputation as a peaceful, progressive place - 2014's official Happiest City in America. Here, in their own words, some of those closest to the events of that weekend tell the story of what happened, why it happened, and what it meant to a city and a nation.You may find some language offensive. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Charlottesville Daily ProgressIt's important to understand that this didn't happen in a vacuum, it didn't just pop up and surprise everybody. It felt over the course of the summer that things were building up in Charlottesville. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentPeople hadn't quite understood the level of violence or hatred or the numbers of people coming to town, but the town was very much aware. It was like a hurricane was coming. Jalane Schmidt, University of Virginia professor, Black Lives Matter activistThe propaganda that the alt-right had put out was martial in its imagery. It was a march on Charlottesville. It was very militaristic. We felt like we were going to be under siege. Dr Michael Williams, surgeon, UVA hospitalWe got a plan in place in anticipation, but I got a fair amount of push-back from my colleagues in surgery. They said ""This is going to be a big nothing."" Seth Wispelwey, local ministerIt felt to me like a profound test. But there was no question about where I belonged and what I wanted to do. Brenda Brown-Grooms, local ministerWe'd been monitoring the social media posts of the alt-right and they were detailing their hopes for the weekend, hopes for inciting a race war in the country, so we knew it was going to be dire. Jalane SchmidtThe crazy thing is we tried to warn the city. We had infiltrated chat rooms, taken screenshots. We made six dossiers, presented them to police, the city council, anyone who would listen. We said, ""This is not a First Amendment rally. They are literally coming to kill us."" Emily Gorcenski, local activistThere were explicit calls for violence there. We presented them to the city in the hope they would shut the rally down before it began. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsThe information we gave them fell on deaf ears. Emily GorcenskiWhen that failed, we knew we were in for a bad day. The statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville How it began -Manycities in America contendedwith their Confederate monumentsand the legacy of slavery, but it would be Charlottesville, near the former capital of theConfederacy, that would bear the brunt of the controversy. Jalane SchmidtIn 2016 a young teenage activist here in Charlottesville started a petition to remove the Confederate monuments. At the same time, we had the Republican primary campaign heating up with Trump winning more and more states. Local white supremacists got upset about the efforts to remove the statues and they were fuelled by the feedback nationally, saying ""This is OK, it's open season to be racist."" Zyahna Bryant, teenage activistI had to write a school paper about something I could change and I had been thinking about public spaces in Charlottesville. I thought it was important to draw attention to how Confederate imagery is violent and what it represents for people of colour. Eventually I turned my paper into a petition. Wes Bellamy, Charlottesville councillor and former deputy mayorWhen I first started talking about moving the statues, people were livid, they hated hearing about it. I started getting racist abuse - ""We're going to get you nigger,"" that kind of thing. Zyahna BryantFor me, it's hard because there are no statues in Charlottesville that depict African-American heroes. And so for that reason alone, black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces. We are not represented. Jalane SchmidtThose statues were put up in the 1920s in order to edify the white public and they are still there for the edification of white people. And now people are shifting the reason. Now it's because they don't want to forget history? Charles Weber, Charlottesville lawyer fightingthe removal of thestatuesOur view was that the city didn't have the authority to do what they proposed to do. Aside from being magnificent works of art and places of beauty for the city, the statues are a memorial to war veterans. It's not in America's DNA to deny its own history. Zyahna Bryant: ""Black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces"" Jalane SchmidtOn 29 January 2017, the mayor called a press conference in front of the city hall. And he announced that Charlottesville was now the capital of the resistance. People cheered. That resonated with a lot of people, but it put a target on our backs. Wes BellamyThe Nazis and Confederates started coming out of the woodwork. Then Jason Kessler came to light. Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rallyI wasn't really involved in local politics, I didn't find Charlottesville politics or any other politics very interesting. Then I was doing yard work one day for a friend and he happened to bring up the Robert E Lee statue and how the city was trying to tear it down. I thought it was symbolic of a lot of things happening in society. Claire GastaÃ±aga, executive director, ACLU VirginiaJason Kessler applied for a permit for a rally at Emancipation Park, some time last spring. The way the Charlottesville process works, a permit is granted automatically if there's no negative decision in 10 days. Jason KesslerShoot, the moment I put in the application didn't feel that eventful. After 10 days it was approved and I set about calling different people in the alternative media, on the internet. Some describe them as alt-right, some as alt-light. Charles WeberJason Kessler and Richard Spencer, both University of Virginia graduates, saw the argument over the statues as a way to promote their own cause. We were horrified by that. Jalane Schmidt, UVA professor and Black Lives Matter activist Nikuyah Walker, counter-protester, now Charlottesville mayorPeople like Kessler and Spencer started to get a little leery of whether white supremacy would be maintained. That's what this was about: ""How dare you, a primarily white council, vote to take down our statues?"" Jason KesslerRichard Spencer is a white nationalist. Personally I don't call myself a white nationalist. I consider myself a civil and human rights advocate, focused on the caucasian demographic. Isaac Smith, former ally of Jason KesslerKessler's idea was to try to unite the alt-right with the mainstream right, and get regular Republicans to show up. Jason KesslerThe moderate speakers did not want to be on the same stage as Richard Spencer, so it ended up being much more far right than I intended it to be. Claire GastaÃ±aga, executive director,ACLU VirginiaPeople had been calling all that week for Kessler's permit to be revoked. After a series of closed meetings, Charlottesville council sent him a letter saying it was revoked but they would consider reissuing it if he moved the rally to a different location. He tweeted us at about 2am on the Tuesday before the weekend, asking if we would be interested in giving him legal assistance. There was nothing about his political positions that we agreed with, but there are rules and governments have to follow those rules. We filed a complaint on Thursday and the judge held a hearing on the Friday night, about 9pm, and ruled that the decision to revoke Kessler's permit was an unconstitutional decision based on the content of his speech. So the permit was reissued. Walt Heinecke, University of Virginia professorWe decided to apply for permits for counter-protests. I teach a class in citizenship so I thought it was time for me to put my money where my mouth was. We are in a battle for the soul of America at this point, and I thought it was time for people to step up. White nationalists gather at the base of the Thomas Jefferson statue on the UVA campus Friday night-White nationalist ralliers gather at Nameless Fieldin Charlottesvilleand march through the University of Virginia Campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. At a statue of Thomas Jefferson, they are met by student activists who link arms around the statue's base. Emily Gorcenski, local activistWe were expecting a torch march at some point. Jason Kessler is a local and we know how he operates. And there's only a few locations something like that could go down. At some point on Friday morning we heard it would be after dark at the university campus. Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserAbout 9.45pm I was walking over to St Paul's Church, and as I stood on the corner of the park I saw Jason Kessler, Richard Spencer, and a bunch of other people walk by. Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporterMe and the managing editor had been tipped off that something was going to happen on campus. We went down there and found a lot of people with unlit torches. They were kind of in the shadows and you couldn't tell who was who, but it was shocking to see how many people were there. I turned around to listen to Jason Kessler speak and when I turned back suddenly the field was alight. It was like it had happened in an instant. Jason KesslerLighting torches is a protest tactic that has been used by all kinds of different people. To think that the KKK invented marching symbolically with torches is outrageous. The way it was explained to me was that it was a funeral march for the fallen dead of our European ancestors. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentThere was an interfaith service across the road at St Paul's and my whole family was there. My one-year-old nephew started crying inside so we went outside and fell asleep, and when we woke up there were white nationalists marching past. Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activistThe preacher came in to the church and said there were Nazis outside with torches, there were hundreds of them and they were marching on the church. There was a lot of confusion. We thought maybe they were coming to the church to torch it. I heard ""You will not replace us, Jews will not replace us."" Seeing them, by the hundreds, the torches bobbing, it was horrifying. Jason Kessler at the UVA campus torch march Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeonWe were made aware that university police were responding to an unexpected assembly, 150-200 people carrying torches. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe were on lockdown at St Paul's, and when I finally got out I was sitting on the brick wall on the corner, and I saw this line of lights coming towards me. I thought ""Oh God, these people can't come right up here."" Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserAn activist came by and said ""Your students are surrounded by Nazis."" I ran over there with a friend and what I noticed was there was no police presence, and there were 150 or so Nazis, fascists with torches, screaming racial epithets. Student activists were around the Jefferson statue, locking arms peacefully, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"". Emily GorcenskiThere was a moment when I saw them marching towards us that I would describe as the worst thing I've ever felt in my life. It was absolute terror. Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporterOne of the things that struck me was the organisation - they were calling for men over 200 pounds to stand on the outside for security, things like that. It was loud, it was chaotic, it was booming in your ears. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI could see and smell the torches. And unfortunately, as a person of colour in this country, I don't have to go back far to remember those things, to remember feeling totally unprotected, unheard, unseen, and unwanted. Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayorThere was a sense of anger that these cowards would march with torches and surround 20 college kids and try to intimidate them. That really showed me who those individuals were. And it let me know how serious it was. Walt HeineckeI waded into the crowd of Nazis with the dean of students and we were assaulted - I got pepper-sprayed, the dean got a torch thrown at him, the students and counter-protesters were being beaten by these guys. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe had been on lockdown in the church. Eventually police arrived over the road at the campus and people began to disperse. We filed out of the back door to avoid the nationalists in the street. Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeonThat was the first clue that our worst fears might come to pass. My feeling for Saturday was ""Oh God, this is really happening."" White nationalists file into Emancipation Park Saturday morning-Local religious leaders fan out across Charlottesville, some to lead prayer services and some to stand on the front line at Emancipation Park. As the morning progresses and the temperature rises, white nationalists and counter-protesters pour into the streets around the park. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe had a sunrise service at six in the morning, at First Baptist Church, Main. It was hot as blazes, as it is wont to be in Charlottesville in August. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaWe had what I call a pre-op briefing which we have before events, where we lay out the plan for the guys for the day. We were nervous. I could see it in the guys, the way they were gearing up. They knew it wasn't going to be good. When we first got to the park, about 7.30am, it was tense. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentAs soon as I got downtown I knew Charlottesville had completely transformed. Rev Seth WispelweyAbout 8am, those of us called to the front line - about 50 in all - marched from First Baptist church on Main Street to Emancipation Park. For two and a half hours, we sang, prayed, and tried to diffuse tension. We bore witness as groups of men began to march in and the temperature started to rise. EzÃ© Amos, freelance photographerAt first, everybody was singing and walking peacefully. As we walked there was a gentleman standing there with a white T-shirt. I knew the uniform and took a few photos and made him look up, and I got a nice clean shot of his face. He turned out to be the driver of the car. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressI got to Emancipation Park at 9am. The rally wasn't scheduled to begin til noon but there were already hundreds of people arriving at the park. There was so much rhetoric around the media, but I'm a white male so I didn't have it that bad. EzÃ© is from Africa, he was much more of a target. EzÃ© AmosI saw the first wave of alt-right guys march up, led by Eli Mosley. They said some things to me, called me a nigger. An alt-right guy in a Hitler and swastika T-shirt punched me in the face in front of the police. The police did absolutely nothing. Rev Seth Wispelwey, centre, locks arms with other clergy members at the entrance to the park Rev Seth WispelweyWe were linking arms at the entrance to the park, just like John Lewis and his people did in Selma. We saw a wave coming over the hill, and I thought ""This is what we prepared for."" Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaThe alt-right filed in carrying clubs and shields. They had their baseball batting helmets, chanting ""White is right"", screaming ""History not heritage"" and things like that. Rev Seth WispelweyThey battered through the line of clergy. Then about 500 members of the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement - literal Nazis - came over the crest of Market Street. Christian YinglingEverybody came together at the same point in the street out in front of the park. The city of Charlottesville knew who was coming to town, they did their homework, so why would you funnel group after group, right and left, right through each other? It made no sense. Ryan KellyThere were barriers in the park to keep people separate but as people went in everyone got mixed up with everyone else. People were throwing bottles, there was pepper spray burning people's eyes. Claire GastaÃ±aga, ACLU VirginiaI was on the corner of Second and Market St. It was clear there was no effort to separate the two sides - there was almost permission to engage in violence. Brennan GilmoreIt was pretty clear to me it was not going to end well. The place was awash with weapons and you didn't know who was legitimate security or who was from a militia. Christian YinglingThirty-two guys walking down the street in full body armour with semi-automatic weapons, sure, it's going to intimidate people. Was that our intention? No. We are a really community-minded organisation and we are trying to get out of that stereotype that militias are fat guys hiding out in the woods waiting for the government. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressThe militia groups claimed they were just maintaining the peace, but they were all wearing camo and military gear and carrying rifles and handguns. It added to the sense of hostility. Emily Gorcenski, local activistThe militia didn't do anything to keep the peace. I think they wanted to stand there and roleplay. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot MilitiaThe reason for us to be there had nothing to do with white supremacy - I completely disagree with their message. But they had the right to say whatever they wanted, and the counter-protesters had that right too, and that's why we were there. Emily GorcenskiWhen you look at what these militia groups are saying, it's very rarely in the defence of black people, for example. It's very rarely in the defence of liberals or progressives or socialists. It only seems to be in defence of forces in our society that continue to oppress minorities. Christian Yingling of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia, at Emancipation Park Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI was at the First United Methodist Church. We kept being locked down in the building. There were Nazis shouting outside, Antifa trying to combat them. People in the church were trying to sing over the din. The helicopters were hovering overhead, their rotor blades wapping. We looked at one another and started praying hard. Dr Michael WilliamsAs the only physician here at UVA who was involved in 9/11 - I was in DC - the feeling of dread I had was exactly the same. That feeling you were being targeted from the outside by people who were outright evil. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsThere was a narrative that people came to town to stir up trouble, but we have to take that back. Certainly people came to town, but they were also already here. They live here. I see them all the time. Ryan KellyThere were hundreds, if not thousands, of people around the park at this point. It was tough to keep track. Rev Seth WispelweyThere were roving groups of men, most in polo shirts, many carrying sticks, bats, all in the street. What was surreal was seeing all the monuments around the city surrounded by hundreds of people intending to cause violence. When we got face to face with these white supremacists, all the slurs were anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic - we didn't hear anything anti-black or anti-Muslim. It was even more primitive. Christian YinglingOver five and a half hours, we had bricks thrown, people being hurt by clubs, paint and faeces tossed at my people. The majority were from hate groups - they came organised, they had a plan, you could tell by the way they marched. Antifa had their plan too, because they came with coolers full of stuff to throw at people. Isaac Smith, former Jason Kessler allyLook at who was going to be there, you are putting large radical armed groups - actual Nazis - with actual Communists and you are giving them all guns. That was a recipe for disaster. There were definitely alt-right groups I could see were armed to the teeth. And then you also had the far-left, Redneck Revolt. Most of Charlottesville who were counter-demonstrating were peaceful, but there were a lot of out-of-towners who had wanted to punch a Nazi for their whole lives and finally they had an opportunity. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressIt was really strange because it was all happening with this giant police presence around the outer edges of the park. Claire GastaÃ±agaNobody predicted that the police would have been as incompetent as they were. It never occurred to us that they wouldn't keep the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators separate. Nikuyah Walker, counter-protesterPeople were yelling at officers, asking them 'Why didn't you protect us, why didn't you help us?' Ryan KellyIt got worse and worse until the police finally stepped in and said it was an unlawful assembly, and people started to disperse. Dr Michael WilliamsAt the hospital we'd had a trickle of people who were faint from the heat, but in the morning we were mainly just watching the TV and listening to the radio communication. Then I heard on the police radio, ""Pedestrians struck, multiple victims, potentially as many as 40."" A memorial to Heather Heyer at the place where she died Saturday afternoon-At the corner of Water Street and Fourth, a white nationalist rally-goer ploughs into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters in his car, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring19others. James A Fields, 20, is later arrested and charged with murder. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressI was taking photos on Fourth Street and it was calm, it was the calmest I'd felt all day. It was at that exact second when a car sped past me down the street. Out of instinct I grabbed my camera. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHeather went off with her friends that day to say ""This is our town, get out, this is what we believe, if you don't like it, leave"" and to stand strong with her friends in the community to say black lives do matter. Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville residentI heard the acceleration of a car behind and looked around and saw a vehicle flying down the street. It was immediately apparent what was going on by the manner he was driving. The visual was horrifying, the sound of it was revolting. Jack Basile, gave CPR to Heather HeyerAt first I thought it was an explosion, because all I could see was people flying through the air and people screaming and people running towards me. I have an audio recording and it's hard to listen to. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsWe were watching the live news inside the building, and we screamed when we saw the car hit. The spit fired in my mouth. Emily Gorcenski, local activistWe had been tracking threats of violence online so I knew right away it was an attack, not an accident. My thought at that moment was that he was going to pop out and start shooting at people. My instinct was to run towards the car, towards the attacker. I briefly drew my gun so I was ready in case he did come out shooting. Thankfully he didn't. Ryan Kelly took 80 pictures as the car sped past. He won the Pulitzer Prize for this frame Jack BasileI saw the car backing up the street then I saw Heather lying on her side. I reached around Heather's head and realised instantly it was bad. Then time just seemed to stop. Brennan GilmoreIt was a terrible, terrible moment and all hell broke loose. People were lying in various states of distress, a woman collapsed in front of me. It occurred to me I had been filming it. I debated whether or not to share it, and my first instinct was not to. Emily GorcenskiWe decided at that point was to leave the scene, because some of us had guns and the best thing to do in that scenario was to get the guns out of the situation. Jack BasileWe pulled Heather out from underneath another guy and she took a deep breath and relaxed. There was a critical care nurse who had arrived beside me. I couldn't feel a pulse, she couldn't feel a pulse, and she said let's start CPR. She was doing compressions and I was using a one-way valve mask to help Heather breathe. After a few minutes the police finally showed up. Then paramedics arrived and took over. I walked across the street and sat on the corner in a state of complete and utter shock. Dr Michael WilliamsWe were watching the news and saw the car fly through. When Heather Heyer came in, CPR was in progress and then 14 others came in. We occasionally see blunt force trauma victims, but it's never or rarely intentional. And it's very rare that we'd get 10 at once, from the same incident. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHeather's best friend called me to tell me that the hospital was looking for the next of kin and I knew if he called me, there was something wrong because he never calls unless something's wrong. Dr Michael WilliamsPeople were brought in covered in swastikas and other symbols I would equate with hate. But in the moment we were just taking care of the patients. You don't see the swastikas. I'm African-American, and afterwards, you realise you have got a person here who literally would just as sooner see you dead. But you remind yourself of why you got into the profession. Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily ProgressIt wasn't until I looked at the pictures in full size that the gravity of it hit me. There was one photo specifically that I thought was the most telling, and that was the one we have all seen, the one that went viral and won the Pulitzer. We didn't publish it initially. I talked to my editor and the other photographer, they went to the company and the lawyer and they said ""Let's publish it."" Brennan GilmoreI thought that showing [what I had filmed] was necessary to tell people in Charlottesville ""stay away, stay home, the stakes are fatal."" It never entered my mind that I would be targeted for sharing it. It wasn't until a day later that I heard about the conspiracy theory, that everything I had seen was a set-up, a propaganda operation. These far-right boards had listed my family members. I went through a hellish week of being targeted by these conspiracy theorists. I had friends I'd grown up with who were accusing me. Susan BroI can't begin to tell you how horrendous that day was. They walked me up to the room and the detective told me that she was pronounced dead. I just put down my head and let out an ungodly sound. Jack BasileI had a really, really difficult time afterwards and it is still with me. I still have my press pass from that day, in a bag, and it still has blood on it. Susan BroAfter Heather died there was a period of time, probably three months at least, and it still happens occasionally, where I'd be walking through town and someone would come up to me and say ""I knew Heather and she touched my life."" Three hours after the attack, a Virginia State Police helicopterwhich was monitoring the rally crashed outsideCharlottesville, killingLieutenant H Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M M Bates. People draw on a sidewalk near a memorial to Heather Heyer, ahead of the anniversary Tuesday afternoon, New York - President Trump has already made two statements on Charlottesville, first stating on Saturday, to the dismay of many watching, that there was violence ""on many sides"", before delivering prepared remarks on Sunday in which he condemned white nationalism. At a press conference in New York on Tuesday, he makes his third statement on the violence. Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The HillThe press conference was billed as an announcement on infrastructure and we were told he wasn't planning on taking questions. You never know what's going to happen with him, but we weren't expecting him to wade back into this. He started to wrap up and a reporter shouted out a question and he answered it, and it was off to the races. Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activistI was watching TV and I heard Trump say there were ""good people on both sides"". Jordan FabianAs he made those remarks, the atmosphere at the press conference got more and more heated. I remember, there was a lot of staff in the lobby of Trump Tower. John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, was off to one side rubbing his temples. I looked at Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary, and she was standing there silently. They looked shocked at how it was playing out. Christine Emba, opinion editor, The Washington PostThe hope was that surely, surely the President of the United States would say something appropriate. Say ""This is not who we are."" Or ""Racism is bad"", perhaps? That we are against white supremacy? The fact that he could not bring himself to do that was a shocking confirmation that we were in a newly bad place. Zyahna Bryant,Charlottesvillehigh school studentI was in Charlottesville near downtown and I was watching him on the TV with some friends and we were all just like, what? Twitter was blowing up, Facebook and Instagram were blowing up. Jordan FabianJust judging from the body language, I think a lot of his staff were uncomfortable with what he was saying. Gary Cohn appeared to be gesturing to the president to wrap it up. Of course the president just kept talking and talking. Jalane SchmidtThere was dismay. To have your president say that - it was mortifying that anybody could dare make any moral equivalency between counter-protesters and these white supremacist haters bent on murder. It was just insulting. Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Lightfoot MilitiaI was standing in the kitchen and I remember the moment he said ""There are good people on both sides and bad people on both sides"", and then he threw in a little nugget about the one good group that was there. That really caught my ear. I looked at my wife, ""Did I just get a nod from the president?"" ""I think you did,"" she said. Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rallyIn the environment of sensationalism, and blaming only one side, it was good to hear the president mention that we had a permit. People don't know that. This video can not be played Trump's Tuesday press conference at Trump Tower Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherTrump's office called while I was at the funeral and I had my phone turned off. I turned my phone on at 10pm and I saw that there had been three voicemails from the president's office. They sounded increasingly frantic. I turned on the news and heard him say that there were good people on both sides and I thought, I don't want to talk to him. Christian YinglingIt was really like any other protest - there were good people on both sides. Not all the people who went up to the park that day were white supremacists. Isaac Smith, former Kessler allyIt was relatively clumsy, but not fundamentally incorrect. There are better ways he could have made the same point.. There were people on both sides who energetically participated in violence: it's not as simple as 'one side attacked the other and one side defended themselves'. Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The HillIf you compare to previous administrations, I don't think there would be situation where you would have a soft-pedalling reaction to any kind of white supremacist violence. But the president had said what he said the first time, and sort of taken it back. Then when he doubled down on his first response at that press conference at Trump Tower, in such a vehement way, I think that let a lot of people know that's what he truly felt about the situation. Christine Emba, Washington PostAs an African American person living in America, it felt like a double betrayal. First, he couldn't bring himself to admit that it was not ""both sides"" - that there's a difference between white supremacists and people pushing back against them. Then we had to wait for him to be reined in by a trained communications professional, but he still couldn't stick to that.In the end, he said what he really wanted to say. He was addressing aid and comfort to the people he wanted to reassure, and that was white supremacists and his more racist supporters. He put himself on the side of an America we had hoped we were leaving behind. Zyahna BryantWhat he said really created a ripple effect. I've heard people all over, even within our community, say we have to pay attention to the violence on both sides. Jordan FabianI think that still a year later stands out as one of the lowest moments of President Trump's time in office. Christine EmbaAnd he hasn't done very much since to make anyone feel better. He went from that to deriding the NFL protesters who took a knee, to calling African nations shithole countries, to calling MS-13 members animals. It hasn't gotten better. A Confederate battle flag flies over the I-64 highway, outside Charlottesville, August 1, 2018 Today-Charlottesville has elected Nikuyah Walker, who was among the counter-protesters in August, as the city's first black woman mayor, andmany in the citysee progress wrought from the wounds of that weekend. Others see a deep racial inequality laid bare but barely changed by what happened. TheConfederate statues still stand, and the city has declared a state of emergency ahead of the anniversary. Rev Brenda Brown-GroomsI was born in Charlottesville in the basement of the University of Virginia, among the lead-dripping pipes, because that's where the coloured babies were born. I could not have been born at Martha Jefferson hospital. Even if my mother had been crowning with me she would not have been allowed in. There is an ugly truth in Charlottesville and in America, and it is the legacy of white supremacy. Nikuyah Walker, mayor of CharlottesvilleCharlottesville has always been a pretty segregated area. I grew up like many black families in the community: working-class families, parents working every day, multiple jobs, attempting to make ends meet. It's a very different experience from the Charlottesville in our brochures and the ""world-class city"" designation we attempt to give ourselves. Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayorWe used to think we were somehow better than the other communities and cities in which you saw overt white supremacy. Ours was always much more covert and underhanded, it wasn't directly in your face. Nikuyah WalkerI know previous generations - my parents' generation, grandparents - learned to stay out of the way, learned to do what you need to do to get by. Jalane SchmidtLocal white folks tend to think of this as a liberal place but black people - and I am African American - we see a lot of contradictions. The police stopping and frisking black people. The gentrification. The lack of affordable housing. The struggle to get living wage. Zyahna Bryant, student who wrote the original statue petitionThere are still unspoken boundaries in Charlottesville, places where people of colour are not welcome. The downtown mall is not a very welcoming space. Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's motherHave things changed in Charlottesville? It depends on who you ask. If you ask a wealthy white person, the town is wonderful and it has always been wonderful. If you ask someone who is not wealthy and not white, you would get a different perspective. August 12 was not the beginning or the end of the situation here. Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, standing ahead of the anniversary at the place her daughter was killed Zyahna BryantAugust 12 was only a reflection of the history of Charlottesville and how racist it really is. August 12 is every day. A lot of people want us to move into this ""August 13"" phase where we move past everything, but we are still in this paralysis of August 12. We are still there. EzÃ© Amos, photographerSome things have started to change, in the sense that people talk about the racial divide, inequality. More white people are being outspoken about it, which I really appreciate. Claire GastaÃ±aga, ACLU VirginiaWhat happened provoked a sense that we haven't really had the conversations about race in America that we need to have. There's a great need for that. Whether there's the will for it remains an important question. Wes BellamyWe just took 120 people from Charlottesville on a pilgrimage to Montgomery, Alabama, to learn about civil rights and the history of lynching. We have finally recognised John Henry James, a man who was lynched here in 1898. We put a lynching marker up and gave him his proper due. Those things would not have happened were it not for what occurred that weekend. The legacy is not just about statues and park names, those are ultimately superficial things. There are things happening on the ground that are changing the landscape of the community. Ryan Kelly, photographerI love this city, but what happened was a scar on Charlottesville. The fact the whole world now knows this place now because of one attack is depressing. Rev Seth WispelweyOutside of town, I feel Charlottesville had a really positive impact. But it's been hard to face here because we are continuing to live under the threat of white supremacist violence. Susan BroThe hate does not seem to disappear, it just keeps changing forms. Charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, on a recent summer day Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiserThe community in Charlottesville is pretty much ready for whatever happens on the anniversary. Susan BroJason Kessler says he isn't going to do anything here but I wouldn't count on people not showing up. Jason KesslerI was originally hoping to do something in Charlottesville but we had to drop those plans. I don't think Charlottesville has a commitment to public safety. I think it's better for me and the citizens of Charlottesville to have parted ways, and they can heal from whatever mental wounds they've had from this sordid affair and I can do the same. Christine Emba, Washington PostI think people of colour were really affected by Charlottesville, by seeing that historical violence dredged into the present. I think many felt isolated by it. You might be surrounded by white neighbours and friends who say, ""I'm so sorry for you, but we should move on,"" and it's a very isolating feeling. Zyahna BryantThere are people here who continue to deny that racism is even a thing, or that white supremacy is a thing. But white supremacists keep coming to town. Some of them live right here in Charlottesville. We are at a point where it's time to choose a side: either you are going to be on the right side or the wrong side of history. Wes BellamyI still get abuse every day. You think white supremacists are going to stop calling me nigger because of something that happened one weekend last year? Or because now I have a doctorate? Now they call me doctor nigger.

"Bonobos are the non-human primates with the most extensive vocal repertoire Our primate cousins have surprised and impressed scientists in recent years, withrevelations about monkeys' tool-using abilitiesand chimps'development of complex sign language. But researchers are still probing the question: why are we humans the only apes that can talk? That puzzle has now led to an insight into how different non-human primates' brains are ""wired"" for vocal ability. A new study has compared different primate species' brains. It revealed that primates with wider ""vocal repertoires"" had more of their brain dedicated to controlling their vocal apparatus. That suggests that our own speaking skills may have evolved as our brains gradually rewired to control that apparatus, rather than purely because we're smarter than non-human apes. Humans and other primates have very similar vocal anatomy - in terms of their tongues and larynx. That's the physical machinery in the throat which allows us to turn air into sound. So, as lead researcher Dr Jacob Dunn from Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge explained, it remains a mystery that only human primates can actually talk. ""That's likely due to differences in the brain,"" Dr Dunn told BBC News, ""but there haven't been comparative studies across species."" That comparison is exactly what Dr Dunn and his colleague Prof Jeroen Smaers set out to do. They ranked 34 different primate species based on their vocal abilities - the number of distinct calls they are known to make in the wild. They then examined the brain of each species, using information from existing, preserved brains that had been kept for research. ""It turns out there's this signature within the brains of primates that relates directly to their vocal repertoire,"" said Dr Dunn. Proboscis monkeys have only four known vocalisations Bottom of his ranked list of primates was the proboscis monkey, with four known distinct calls. The apes - led by the bonobo - were at the top; bonobos make 38 distinct calls and it has been suggested that theiruse of vocalisations are a glimpse of the early evolution of language. These more vocally adept apes, the study revealed, had relatively large areas of the brain known as cortical association areas - essentially brain regions which receive sensory input and decide what to do with it. ""They're a kind of filter to control the decision-making process,"" explained Dr Dunn. Also, and perhaps most importantly, bonobos and the other more vocal apes - including chimpanzees - had much larger parts of the brain dedicated to control of the tongue. This suggests, the researchers say, that while our primate cousins may well be sufficiently smart to develop and understand complex ways of communicating, the voluntary control of their ""vocal apparatus"" - rather than their intelligence - is the limiting factor. Since we cannot study our extinct human ancestors, scientists all over the world still look to our closest primate cousins to fill the gaps in our knowledge about the evolution of something as complex and crucial to humanity as language. Understanding how the brain is wired in these different primate species and how that relates to vocal ability, could, suggested Dr Dunn, ""go some way to helping us understand how the complex voluntary control over vocal production may have evolved in humans,"" ultimately leading to our own ability to speak. But researchers studying the origins of speech and language still have questions. Prof Zanna Clay from Durham University is currently in Congo continuing her extensive study of bonobos. She told BBC News that this particular study was interesting, but cautioned that a much more basic understanding of how exactly primates themselves use and understand their vocalisations was needed before conclusions like these could be confirmed. ""We do not even really understand how the primates themselves classify their own vocal repertoires - this needs to come first before correlations are made,"" she said. ""We [also] know that many primates and other animals can escape the constraints of a relatively fixed vocal system by combining calls together in different ways to create different meanings. ""The extent to which call combinations might map on to [brain anatomy] would be a promising avenue to explore."" Follow Victoria on Twitter,external.

"Ryanair pilots are striking in five European countries, forcing the cancellation of a sixth of the firm's flights during the holiday season peak. The 24-hour walk-out involves staff in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers are understood to have been told of cancellations on 400 flights. The action is the largest in a series of strikes over pay and conditions. Ryanair says it has made every effort to resolve the dispute. The company says 85% of its scheduled flights will operate as normal on Saturday and the majority of customers affected have been given places on other Ryanair flights. The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, averted widespread strikes before Christmas byagreeing to recognise unions for the first timein its 30-year history. But there have been protests ever since over the negotiating of collective labour agreements. About 300 Ryanair flights were cancelled in July when cabin crews in Belgium, Portugal and Spain went on strike for 48 hours. Emily Dutton was due to fly to Gothenburg in Sweden for a wedding, with her boyfriend Craig. But the ""once in a lifetime experience"" of being at her best friend Justine's wedding seems impossible now, after Ryanair cancelled her flight with two days' notice. The 27-year-old project manager from Letchworth was due to fly from Stansted Airport, and was told there were no alternative flights for the rest of the day. Emily Dutton and her boyfriend Craig were due to fly to Gothenburg for a best friend's wedding ""The only reason I found this out was through a reminder email about checking in being sent to my email account. ""Had I not checked, I would have arrived at the airport only to find my flight being cancelled. ""I spent about four hours [yesterday] calling them and trying to find my own travel options to see how to get to Sweden. ""They couldn't find us any alternative flights until Sunday. Great news, the wedding is on Saturday so that was absolutely no use."" She tried to find any other flights to Sweden from other UK airports, and even asked if she could fly to Copenhagen in Denmark, and get a train to Gothenburg instead. ""My only options were to get a refund or to go down the route - which I have done - to claim compensation."" The airline in recent days announced the cancellations of 250 flights in and out Germany, 104 to and from Belgium and another 42 affecting Sweden and Ireland. A Dutch court on Thursday evening rejected a case from Ryanair seeking to block pilots in the Netherlands from joining the strike, affecting about 22 flights. But at about the same time Ryanair issued a statement saying there would be no cancellations. The unions want the contracts of Ryanair employees to be governed by the laws of the nation where they are based, not by Irish legislation. Ryanair has described the strike action as ""regrettable and unjustified"", claiming its pilots are paid more than other budget airlines. It said it has taken every step to minimise the disruption,,externaladding: ""The majority of customers affected have already been re-accommodated on another Ryanair flight."" The airline hasmaintained that strikes qualify as ""extraordinary circumstances""and are therefore exempt from EU compensation rules. But the Civil Aviation Authority says that, in the case of strikes by an airline's employees, the airline is responsible for compensation. Consumer group Which? said affected passengers should lodge a claim with the airline. Which? travel editor Rory Boland said the dispute resolution service used by Ryanair had already confirmed it would uphold a previous European ruling that crew strikes are not usually considered ""extraordinary circumstances"".

"""We'll be there for you..."" It's been 14 years since Friends ended, but we love Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe as much as always. The sitcom has beaten recent releases to top a list of the UK's most popular shows on paid-for streaming services. Netflix UK added Friends in January and twice as many episodes were streamed in the first three months of 2018 than its nearest rival, Amazon's The Grand Tour. Services like Netflix and Amazon don't publish viewer figures, but this data has been released by TV watchdog Ofcom. The list inOfcom's Media Nations report,external, based on a survey of 2,500 viewers, ranks the most-watched programmes on subscription streaming services. Although Netflix is pumping huge sums into its original programming - spending about $6.8bn (Â£5.3bn) this year alone - a show that ran from 1994-2004 has come out on top. The popularity of Friends probably has something to do with many fans binge viewing after 234 episodes were added to Netflix UK at the start of the year. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video & Now TV, January-March 2018. Source: GfK/Ofcom While many Friends fans were delighted when it arrived on Netflix UK, it sparked a debate after some people found parts of the humour were now unpalatable. Still Friends? The trouble with old sitcoms Friends' baby Emma twins are now 16 and are going to Hollywood Writer Rebecca Reidtold BBC Radio 5 live in Januaryshe ""couldn't believe how badly it has aged"". ""The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian,"" she said. ""The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."" She did acknowledge, however, that ""she did sort of love it"". There is still huge interest in the show, and Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel, recently saidshe ""fantasises"" about the show being brought back. As well as being on Netflix, the show is broadcast on Comedy Central daily in the UK. The channel has also enjoyed success with FriendsFest - a live touring event where fans can walk into recreations of Central Perk and the characters' apartments. Tickets have sold out in four of the six cities it is visiting this summer. We went to FriendsFest in Manchester to ask fans why the show still appeals. Sue Kemp, 48, from Liverpool, has been watching since the first episode, and daughter Rose, 21, is now a big fan too. ""Even my younger daughter watches it as well and she's 15, and she finds it just as funny as I do and I'm nearly 50,"" Sue says. ""It's good fun, it's light-hearted, it makes you feel good. You can easily watch two or three episodes a night. Come in from work, cook the tea, put Friends on."" Rose has been bingeing on the show since it appeared on Netflix at the start of the year. ""I've watched it start to finish twice. Maybe three times,"" she says. Should it ever return? ""I'd love to see a sequel,"" she says. ""Even just a movie catching up with them where they are now. Did Ross and Rachel ever really get together and live together? Did Monica and Chandler last?"" For sisters Cara Templeman (left, in the recreated Central Perk) and Jamie Sutcliffe, from Halifax, watching the show reminds them of when they were growing up. ""The jokes are still funny now. We were probably 10 or 11 when we first watched it,"" says Cara, 29. Jamie, 27, adds: ""A lot of the jokes probably went over our heads when we first watched it but now you watch it back and you find new things funny that you didn't find funny the first time."" Her sister continues: ""It's not offensive or anything like that is it? Sometimes you watch old programmes and you think, ooh, that wouldn't work now. There's not much in it like that."" Jamie says she recently watched all the episodes again to educate her husband. ""When it came on Netflix. I was like, 'Right, start to finish, we're watching it.' So we did, and he got into it. ""It only took us just over a month. I've just finished my PhD so I needed some wind-down time!"" Husband and wife Ben and Sarah Sloan, from Bolton (pictured in replicas of Joey and Chandler's chairs) can relate to different things as they've got older. ""Chandler's sarcasm and the stuff Ross gets himself into - I see myself getting into those situations sometimes,"" says Ben, 34. Sarah, 33, adds: ""I've read a lot lately about how it doesn't appeal to millennials, but we are millennials, I think. I love it just as much now as I did when I was younger, but now I see different things that I find funny. ""Now we're married and have kids there are other things we appreciate. As we've got older and they've got older we can understand the stresses and things, and how it's brought to a humorous light."" The couple mainly watch on Comedy Central. ""There's been this period in the last few years where it's always on the telly when you turn it on,"" Sarah says.

"This video can not be played Footage from the arresting officer's bodycam has been shown to the jury at Mr Stokes' trial. England cricketer Ben Stokes told a court he ""stepped in"" to defend two gay men before an alleged brawl. The Durham all-rounder is one of two men accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub on 25 September. Mr Stokes, 27, denies affray and says he acted in self defence. He said he had drunk up to three pints and six vodka and lemonades but was not drunk. Ryan Ali, 28, has also denied affray while Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted at Bristol Crown Court of affray earlier. Giving evidence for the first time, Mr Stokes told the court he intervened when he heard Mr Hale and Mr Ali ""shouting homophobic comments"" at two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. He told the jury: ""I stepped in and said 'you shouldn't be saying these things to these two men'."" The prosecution has accused Mr Stokes of mimicking the voices and mannerisms of Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor in what was described as ""a derogatory way"". Mr Stokes was asked by his barrister Gordon Cole QC if any of his actions towards the two gay men outside Mbargo nightclub were homophobic. The cricketer told the court: ""Definitely not. The only comments between myself and this gay couple was about what we was wearing that night."" Prosecutors previously told the court Mr Ali, who they say had been holding a glass beer bottle, and Mr Hale were knocked unconscious by Mr Stokes. Ben Stokes has begun giving evidence in his defence in court When asked what was ""the first action in any violence"" Mr Stokes replied: ""Mr Ali turning the bottle he had. He took the neck of the bottle."" Mr Stokes said he had been ""protecting himself"" and the people around him when he got involved in the fight. He said: ""I took the decision for what I did very quickly. As soon as this episode started I knew not just myself but other people could be a target of these two men. He added: ""As soon as I decided to get involved, everything I did was under self-defence. I did what I could to keep myself and those around me safe."" When asked if he had become ""enraged"" at any point during the incident, Mr Stokes replied it was a ""difficult question to answer"". The 6ft 2in tall sportsman added: ""I didn't know they could be carrying more weapons on them. ""They could decide to attack me at any time if I was to turn my back on either of these two. ""At all times I felt under threat from these two."" Mr Stokes, who was dressed in court in a blue suit, white shirt and blue tie, said that after a win against the West Indies he had celebrated at the ground then had two or three pints with a meal. After the meal, Mr Stokes and some of his England teammates went to Mbargo, where they drank five or six vodka and lemonades. Mr Cole asked: ""Were you drunk?"" ""No,"" Mr Stokes replied. The cricketer said a large group then decided to go to the Pryzm nightclub instead. Mr Cole showed the jury a photograph of Mr Stokes and teammates James Anderson, Jake Ball and Alex Hales taken outside Pryzm. He then returned to Mbargo in a taxi with Mr Hales. Mr Stokes said there was nothing unusual in how he had behaved in his dealings with nightclub doorman Andrew Cunningham. When asked by Mr Cole if he had become enraged at some point, Mr Stokes said: ""No."" He also said he did not remember flicking his cigarette at the gay couple outside the club. Ryan Hale has been found not guilty of affray The court heard earlier that former soldier Mr Hale told police in a formal interview he believed Mr Stokes could have killed him. He added: ""I'm a dad. He could have killed me. I don't know why he didn't stop."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, and Mr Ali, of Bristol, both deny a joint charge of affray. The trial continues.
