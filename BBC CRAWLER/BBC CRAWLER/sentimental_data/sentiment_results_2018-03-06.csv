"Gary Cohn was director of the National Economic Council under President Trump US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn is resigning, the White House has said. It is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from President Trump's team. There has been speculation that Mr Cohn, a supporter of free trade, was angered by Mr Trump's plans to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. In a statement released by the White House, Mr Cohn said it had been ""an honour to serve my country"". The 57-year-old former president of the Goldman Sachs bank had helped Mr Trump push through his sweeping tax reforms late last year. The people around Donald Trump Why Trump is hanging tough on trade EU condemns US tariff plans Gary Cohn and President Trump were never believed to be close. Mr Cohn wasn't specific about the reasons, saying in a statement it had been ""an honour to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform"". Once that mission had been achieved, a number of differences may have prompted the departure, including the possible looming trade tariff war and his differences on that issue with trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Cohn had reportedly set up a meeting between Mr Trump and business executives who opposed the tariffs move. But Mr Trump pulled out of that meeting and on Tuesday reportedly asked Mr Cohn in the Oval Office to back the tariffs publicly. Mr Cohn did not answer, sources told Bloomberg. In August last year, Mr Cohn had also criticised Mr Trump over his reaction to a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying the administration ""can and must do better"".He was reported to have drafted a resignation letter after the event,external. An official said: ""For several weeks Gary had been discussing with the president that it was nearing time for him to transition out."" The exact departure date had yet to be determined.

In a statement, Mr Trump said: ""Gary... did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. ""He is a rare talent and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people."" Analysts were pointing to the resignation of Mr Cohn, a free market advocate, as one reason behind a drop in shares across Asia on Wednesday. The Nikkei closed 0.77% down and the Hang Seng 1.03%. Rick Meckler of LibertyView Capital Management told Reuters that Mr Cohn was ""very credible"" and the resignation announcement ""certainly causes short-term downward pressure"". The dollar continued its retreat against the yen, down from 113 at the start of the year to 105.6 on Wednesday. European stocks also opened lower, the FTSE 100 and pan-Europe STOXX 600 falling about 0.5% after opening. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Gary Cohn was a bit of a stranger in a strange land. He was a Democrat in a Republican White House; an economic globalist working for a president who campaigned on economic nationalism. Now, it seems, Donald Trump's protectionist bent has pushed the top administration economic adviser to the exit. This was not an unexpected development. By many accounts, there had been a contentious White House fight over whether to impose sweeping sanctions on US steel and aluminium imports - a tug-of-war that was settled, precipitously, by the president himself last week. There were the rumours that Mr Cohn was only sticking around to see last year's tax bill over the finish line, after his extreme discomfort following the president's warm words about some of the white nationalist marchers involved in violent clashes in Charlottesville last August. Mr Cohn was reportedly viewed by many Trump loyalists in the White House as an unwelcome interloper. Some on the outside, particularly in the financial world, welcomed him as a moderating influence - along with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Now the former is leaving and the latter two seem greatly weakened. All this could mark a sharp new direction in White House policy. Last week, Mr Trumpannounced he would be imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports- 25% and 10% respectively. He is yet to sign them into effect. He has regularly argued that other countries have been ""taking advantage of"" the US on trade for decades. Trading partners reacted angrily. The EU, which says the steel and aluminium tariffs could cost it â¬2.8bn ($3.48bn; Â£2.5bn) a year, has now drawn up a $3.5bn hit list of retaliatory tariffs. These include higher import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel and industrial products,EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. There are now fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump said on Tuesday: ""When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad."" But there is disquiet at his proposals even among members of Mr Trump's Republican party. House Speaker Paul Ryan was one of those urging Mr Trump to have a ""smarter"" plan that was ""more surgical and more targeted"" and avoided the ""unintended consequences"" of a trade war. Mr Trump tweeted,externalthat he would pick Mr Cohn's replacement ""soon"". ""Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!"" he added. This video can not be played Trump: 'Everybody wants to work in the White House' Possible candidates mooted by US media include Peter Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and 2016 campaign adviser. President Trump tweeted that there was no chaos at the White House but there were ""still... some people that I want to change"". A piece in Bloomberg carries the concerns of Wall St operators,externalthat the White House is losing experienced financial experts. Kathy Wylde, who runs the Partnership for New York City, says: ""Gary was one that we counted on."" A Washington Post article headlined,external""Gary Cohn didn't get much done. But it could be worse - and it probably will"" says the adviser was an ""odd duck"" but that it is hard to fault him, given ""the Trump administration has been too understaffed and unfocused to get much done"". An editorial in the New York Times,externalsays Gary Cohn was ""supposed to be among the sensible adults in the room. Now, he is leaving after failing repeatedly to be the stabilising influence that the Trump administration sorely needed"". Bill Powell in Newsweek,externalsays there are two things Donald Trump really likes - a rising stock market and tariffs. But one thing the resignation of Gary Cohn makes abundantly clear, he says, is that ""you can't have both... the world just doesn't work that way"".

"Myprotein is owned by Northwich-based The Hut Group A man has admitted to lying about buying a pack of protein powder containing a dead mouse. Adam Brenton tweeted criticism of Myprotein Impact Diet Whey seller The Hut.com Ltd and contacted local press with his claims. The story was widely republished but ""unequivocal"" evidence proved the mouse was not present at delivery. At the High Court, Brenton, of Manchester, apologised to The Hut.com Ltd and the manufacturer Cend Ltd. Their advocate, Mathilde Groppo, told Mr Justice Nicklin that Brenton had been a regular satisfied customer since 2009. He contacted The Hut.com Ltd in April last year to report he had found a mouse carcass in a packet of the Myprotein powder. Brenton agreed to hand over the items for testing but criticised The Hut.com Ltd's ""awful"" and ""inept"" customer service on Twitter. A newspaper article, which alleged his health had been put at risk, was picked up by the national press and republished in print and on the internet, Ms Groppo said. CCTV from the time of production was reviewed but nothing out of the ordinary was found, she added. Brenton said the bag was opened for three weeks before the mouse was discovered. The animal was tested by Ecolab, a food safety expert endorsed by the University of Liverpool. Ms Groppo said evidence was ""categorical and unequivocal"" that it could not have entered the product during production and was not present at delivery. She said: ""The suggestion that the complainants were at fault for allowing the mouse to enter the protein powder during the production process, thereby potentially causing harm to Mr Brenton and other customers' health, was false."" Brenton told the judge in London he agreed with the evidence and that The Hut.com Ltd's customer service was ""beyond criticism"". He will also pay The Hut.com Ltd and Cend Ltd unspecified damages and legal costs.

"Peter Hall and his wife Claire Hall have both been sentenced to prison A group of fraudsters who conned UK consumers out of Â£37m by selling passports and driving licences through copycat websites have been sentenced to more than 35 years in jail. The six people, led by Peter Hall and including his wife Claire, operated websites that impersonated official government services. They then sold key documents to people for inflated prices. The illegal profits were used to fund luxury holidays and cars. Mike Andrews, lead co-ordinator of the eCrime team at National Trading Standards, which investigated the fraud, said: ""This was a crime motivated by greed. This group defrauded people so they could enjoy a luxury lifestyle. ""They showed no regard for the unnecessary costs they imposed on their victims - I would say they treated them with contempt."" National Trading Standards said that the defendants set up copycat websites between January 2011 and November 2014 that mimicked government services such as applying for or renewing passports, visas, birth or death certificates, driving licences and tests, car tax discs and the London Congestion Charge. The group also set up sites that copied the American, Turkish, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan official visa sites where people could apply and pay for electronic visas to visit those countries. National Trading Standards said that in all cases the sites offered little or no additional value to consumers using them, adding that it is believed Indian, Turkish and US citizens have also been defrauded. It said that the ""illegal profits funded a glamorous lifestyle for the defendants"". At one point, Claire Hall was preparing to buy a house for Â£1.4m when the authorities intervened. Mr and Mrs Hall were arrested on 27 June 2014. The National Trading Standards eCrime team and the police raided properties across Hampshire. Mr Hall, aged 47, was sentenced to a total of 15 years following two trials which took place in July 2017 and March this year. In the first trial, His Honour Judge Sean Morris said: ""Mr Hall was a highly manipulative and controlling individual and it was a determined, sophisticated long running fraud. He was a charming man but did not charm the jury. ""We live in a computer age, and crime is developing to meet that age. People live by their computers and need to know that the services they purchase online are genuine services."" Peter Hall, 47, sentenced to a total of 15 years in prison. Disqualified as a company director for 10 years Claire Hall, 41, sentenced to four years in prison Syed Bilal Zaidi sentenced to six years in prison in his absence. Whereabouts unknown Collette Ferrow, 50, sentenced to four years in prison Liam Hincks pleaded guilty at July 2017 trial, sentenced to three years. He has pleaded guilty at the March 2018 trial and will be sentenced at a later date Kerry Mills, 49, sentenced to five years. Disqualified as a company director for eight years Mr Andrews said: ""I would urge people to always use the GOV.UK website when looking to apply for any kind of government service such as a passport, driving licence or EHIC card. ""Search engines may seem the easiest route but searching using the GOV.UK website is the safest way of ensuring you do not fall victim to a copycat website."" Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: ""I would urge members of the public to report any copycat websites they spot to the Citizens Advice consumer service by calling 03454 04 05 06.""

"This video can not be played John Ford: ""I did their bank accounts, I stole their rubbish"" An ex-private investigator who was used by The Sunday Times has spoken about the criminal activity he was involved in to obtain information for the paper. John Ford said he targeted politicians such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when they were in government. He said his methods included ""blagging"" or pretending to be a bank or utilities account holder to get information. The Sunday Times said it ""strongly rejects"" the claim that it had ever commissioned anyone to act illegally. Mr Ford claims he was contracted by the paper between 1995 and 2010, during which time he said he targeted members of the Labour government elected in 1997 and members of the public. Asked to describe the nature of his attacks on members of the cabinet, he responded: ""Aggressive, unprincipled. Fishing expeditions often."" Talking about the techniques he used to get information, he said: ""I did their phones, I did their mobiles, I did their bank accounts, I stole their rubbish. ""Hundreds of telephone interceptions, hundreds of bank interceptions. ""Utilities. I've been through mortgages. I've stolen rubbish. I'm afraid the list is endless."" John Ford said Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were among the politicians he targeted A spokesperson for The Sunday Times said the paper had ""a strong record of investigative journalism over decades and has employed many contributors and researchers to work on stories, or parts of stories. ""The paper strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally. ""Some allegations related to the research work of John Ford have been aired previously and we cannot comment on the specifics of these new allegations which all predate 2011."" Gordon Brown 'targeted by Sunday Times' Sunday Times rejects Gordon Brown 'criminal' claims The Sunday Times has also said it has always been its expectation and practice that its contractors work within the law. Mr Ford said he went after 15-20 members of the cabinet during the New Labour era. This video can not be played Prescott: I am a Sunday Times 'blagging' victim John Prescott, who was deputy prime minister between 1997-2007, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believes he was targeted. ""I'll be taking legal advice,"" Mr Prescott said, adding he wanted to find out: ""Are these stories true? Did the Sunday Times act in the way that [Ford] now said he did?"" Mr Prescott admitted some stories may be in the public interest, but questioned whether it was right for papers to use private information illegally accessed by private investigators to find them out. Referring to Ford's admission of using illegal methods to get stories, Mr Prescott said: ""He said he did it. I want to know what the truth is - the Sunday Times denied it all the time."" ""There are public interest issues [in some stories] - there clearly are. Have they a right, then, to go into the banks? Have they a right to pay somebody as an investigator - not a journalist, an investigatorâ¦ just to get a news source?"" ""Would you have them go into your bank accounts to find how much you get paid?"" he asked. Mr Ford's admissions come just days after the government scrapped the second phase of the Leveson Inquiry. The first phase of the inquiry looked into the broad area of press ethics and the relationship between the press, politicians, police and the public. The second phase was withheld in order to avoid prejudicing criminal trials which are now complete. Leveson Inquiry: Proposed second stage axed Explaining his decision to the Commons last week, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said the second stage should not go ahead because it would be costly and deal with past failures. Instead, he argued, the more urgent task was to sustain newspapers - particularly local titles - at a time when they are under immense strain. Victims of press abuse argue that they were promised the second phase by David Cameron when he was prime minister.

"Alzheimer's disease brain (left) compared to normal (right) Four dementia scientists have shared this year's 1m Euro brain prize for pivotal work that has changed our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Profs John Hardy, Bart De Strooper, Michel Goedert, based in the UK, and Prof Christian Haass, from Germany, unpicked key protein changes that lead to this most common type of dementia. On getting the award, Prof Hardy said he hoped new treatments could be found. He is donating some of his prize money to care for Alzheimer's patients. Much of the drug discovery research that's done today builds on their pioneering work, looking for ways to stop the build-up of damaging proteins, such as amyloid and tau. Alzheimer's and other dementias affect 50 million people around the world, and none of the treatments currently available can stop the disease. Prof Hardy's work includes finding rare, faulty genes linked to Alzheimer's disease. These genetic errors implicated a build-up of amyloid as the event that kick-starts damage to nerve cells in Alzheimer's. Profs Hardy and De Strooper discussed how they would spend the prize money This idea, known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, has been central to Alzheimer's research for nearly 30 years. Together with Prof Haass, who is from the University of Munich, Prof Hardy, who's now at University College London, then discovered how amyloid production changes in people with rare inherited forms of Alzheimer's dementia. How one woman and her family transformed Alzheimer's research Prof Goedert's research at Cambridge University, meanwhile, revealed the importance of another damaging protein, called tau, while Prof De Stooper, who is the new director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, discovered how genetic errors that alter the activity of proteins called secretases can lead to Alzheimer's processes. Dr David Reynolds, Chief Scientific Officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Our congratulations go to all four of these outstanding scientists whose vital contributions have transformed our understanding of the complex causes of Alzheimer's disease. ""The fact that three of these researchers work in the UK reflects the country's position as a global leader in dementia research."" Prof Hardy said he would be donating around 5,000 euros of his share of the 1m euros from theLundbeck Foundation,externalto help campaigns to keep Britain in the EU, and called Brexit a ""unmitigated disaster"" for scientific research. He also pledged his thanks to all the people with Alzheimer's who, over the years, have volunteered to help with dementia research.

"Peter Hall and his wife Claire Hall have both been sentenced to prison A group of fraudsters who conned UK consumers out of Â£37m by selling passports and driving licences through copycat websites have been sentenced to more than 35 years in jail. The six people, led by Peter Hall and including his wife Claire, operated websites that impersonated official government services. They then sold key documents to people for inflated prices. The illegal profits were used to fund luxury holidays and cars. Mike Andrews, lead co-ordinator of the eCrime team at National Trading Standards, which investigated the fraud, said: ""This was a crime motivated by greed. This group defrauded people so they could enjoy a luxury lifestyle. ""They showed no regard for the unnecessary costs they imposed on their victims - I would say they treated them with contempt."" National Trading Standards said that the defendants set up copycat websites between January 2011 and November 2014 that mimicked government services such as applying for or renewing passports, visas, birth or death certificates, driving licences and tests, car tax discs and the London Congestion Charge. The group also set up sites that copied the American, Turkish, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan official visa sites where people could apply and pay for electronic visas to visit those countries. National Trading Standards said that in all cases the sites offered little or no additional value to consumers using them, adding that it is believed Indian, Turkish and US citizens have also been defrauded. It said that the ""illegal profits funded a glamorous lifestyle for the defendants"". At one point, Claire Hall was preparing to buy a house for Â£1.4m when the authorities intervened. Mr and Mrs Hall were arrested on 27 June 2014. The National Trading Standards eCrime team and the police raided properties across Hampshire. Mr Hall, aged 47, was sentenced to a total of 15 years following two trials which took place in July 2017 and March this year. In the first trial, His Honour Judge Sean Morris said: ""Mr Hall was a highly manipulative and controlling individual and it was a determined, sophisticated long running fraud. He was a charming man but did not charm the jury. ""We live in a computer age, and crime is developing to meet that age. People live by their computers and need to know that the services they purchase online are genuine services."" Peter Hall, 47, sentenced to a total of 15 years in prison. Disqualified as a company director for 10 years Claire Hall, 41, sentenced to four years in prison Syed Bilal Zaidi sentenced to six years in prison in his absence. Whereabouts unknown Collette Ferrow, 50, sentenced to four years in prison Liam Hincks pleaded guilty at July 2017 trial, sentenced to three years. He has pleaded guilty at the March 2018 trial and will be sentenced at a later date Kerry Mills, 49, sentenced to five years. Disqualified as a company director for eight years Mr Andrews said: ""I would urge people to always use the GOV.UK website when looking to apply for any kind of government service such as a passport, driving licence or EHIC card. ""Search engines may seem the easiest route but searching using the GOV.UK website is the safest way of ensuring you do not fall victim to a copycat website."" Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: ""I would urge members of the public to report any copycat websites they spot to the Citizens Advice consumer service by calling 03454 04 05 06.""

"Mr Trump held a press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven on Tuesday US President Donald Trump has said European Union trade rules make it ""impossible"" for American firms to do business with the bloc. Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had ""taken advantage of"" the US for decades. Shortly afterwards it was announced that White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, would quit. The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. Key Trump economy adviser Cohn resigns Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. This video can not be played Trump: 'Everybody wants to work in the White House' ""The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,"" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. ""They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,"" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a ""loving, loving way"". ""They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,"" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. This video can not be played Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, EU Commissioner for Trade Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. ""When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Swedish PM Stefan Lofven said: ""I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run."" Mr Lofven is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party have voicing disquiet at his proposal. Just before Mr Trump spoke, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: ""There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasise into sort of a larger trade war."" Earlier on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the tariffs were too broad. He urged Mr Trump ""to be more surgical"" when selecting which countries to target ""so we do not have unintended consequences"". Congressman Mark Meadows, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers had told him they did not support the president's decision. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country was planning its own tariffs on US goods. He said they would issue them in a way that is most politically damaging to Mr Trump. ""We would have to target our response at the things they export that are most politically sensitive and hit exactly those goods,"" he told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said ""the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive"", but also said it might be a ""false hope"". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. However previous talks with North Korea have come to nothing. There has also been no immediate comment from Pyongyang itself. Further news that the leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, came via the leader of the South's delegation, Chung Eui-yong. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics ""We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,"" Mr Trump said. ""The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world."" President Trump warned of a ""false hope"" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a ""false hope"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While the US president said he believed Pyongyang's offer to hold denuclearization talks was ""sincere"" he said it was ""also because of the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea."" Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the US remained ""committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program"". All options were on the table, he said, and US posture towards the regime would not change ""until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation"". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. It is difficult to be certain. Since the South made the announcement, there has been no comment from North Korea. Some US and South Korean officials have said that Pyongyang may simply be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes. There have also been suggestions that Mr Kim is trying to soften the impact of biting sanctions on the impoverished country, seeking food and other aid from overseas. Another factor may be growing diplomatic pressure from North Korea's neighbours, particularly from China - the regional superpower and Pyongyang's only real ally. A series of six-party talks have been held since North Korea decided to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have repeatedly failed. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watches the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile In 2009, North Korea pulled out of the talks and expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country, in response to UN Security Council criticism of a rocket launch. Pyongyang also vowed to resume its nuclear activities. A number of bids to restart the talks collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a ""leap day"" agreement with the US. The North said it was commemorating the birth of its founding father, with a new satellite, but it was condemned by others as a provocative test of missile technology. Throughout 2017 Mr Kim ordered a series of incendiary ballistic missile tests, significantly raising the stakes. In response the UN implemented increasingly tough sanctions.

"BrewDog has made a mock ""beer for girls"", saying ""enough is enough with stereotypes"". Pink IPA - a spoof of their beer Punk IPA - has a pink label and will be sold to women for a lower price than men.

"The Mayflower Hotel in Kensington was evacuated and remains closed A Spanish tourist has died after a suspected carbon monoxide leak in a west London hotel. The Mayflower Hotel in Kensington was evacuated after emergency services were called at about 13:50 GMT on Monday. One man was pronounced dead at the scene. Another Spanish man in his 30s, thought to have been staying in the same room, is in a critical condition in hospital. Scotland Yard said initial carbon monoxide tests showed high readings. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus carried out a sweep of the hotel to check levels of the deadly gas, the London Fire Brigade said. A spokesman added: ""Crews isolated the gas supply and ventilated the building."" Police said initial tests found the readings were high, although the investigation run by police and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea's environmental health department has not yet concluded. Some 29 people were evacuated from the hotel, which remains closed although the scene is now safe, police added. A spokesman from Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its London consulate is helping the victims' families. Scotland Yard said a post-mortem examination is yet to be held and the death is being treated as ""unexplained"". The hotel did not respond to a request for comment.

"Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has a mystery illness The parents of a seriously ill toddler have lost their appeal against a High Court decision to end his life support. A judgeruled last monththat doctors at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool can stop treating 21-month-old Alfie Evans against the wishes of his parents Kate James and Tom Evans. They want to take him abroad for treatment for his mystery illness but doctors said it would be ""futile"". Judges at London's Court of Appeal said they could appeal at the Supreme Court. Alfie's parents, from Bootle, Merseyside, were not at the hearing in London but Mr Evans said afterwards he would challenge the decision at the Supreme Court. This video can not be played Tom Evans says: ""Alfie's not ready so we're not ready to let go"" He said: ""Some people might think why didn't they just end it there? ""But how can you end it when you've got a two-year-old boy who's fighting as hard as you could ever picture him. ""At this moment, Alfie's not ready so we're not ready to let go."" Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Announcing the decision at the Court of Appeal, Mrs Justice King said Alfie's parents were ""unable to accept what movements in Alfie they see are not positive responses"". Medical evidence showed that Alfie was ""deeply comatose"" and ""to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings"", she said. Mrs Justice King said Alfie's father wanted to move him to a hospital in Rome then, if necessary, to a hospital in Munich. She added he was passionate and wanted to ""fight on with Alfie's Army"" but she said he had ""no clear plan"". Alder Hey Children's Hospital said in a statement: ""Today the Court of Appeal upheld the judgement from the High Court that continued active treatment is not in Alfie's best interest. ""We understand that this is a very difficult time for Alfie's family and we will continue to work with them to agree the most appropriate palliative care plan for Alfie."" Mr Justice Anthony Hayden said following a hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was ""futile"" and gave doctors permission to provide palliative care only for Alfie. The hospital was set to withdraw ventilation on 23 February before his parents challenged the decision. Alfie's parents want to take him to a hospital in Rome Mrs Justice King said Mr Justice Hayden had considered all evidence presented to him and he ""could not have done more to ensure father and mother had every opportunity to express their views and have them taken into consideration"". She said his approach had been gentle and he could not have given the couple greater respect. But she said the best interests of the child had to prevail. She added he had been ""meticulous and thorough"" and had weighed all arguments raised. Barrister Stephen Knafler QC, who is leading Alfie's parents' legal team, had said ""the state"" had wrongly interfered with ""parental choice"". He said Alfie's parents wanted to move him to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome but Mr Justice Hayden's ruling had prevented them from doing that.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials Donald Trump has reacted cautiously to news that North Korea is willing to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons if it did not feel threatened. The US president said ""the statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive"", but also said it might be a ""false hope"". South Korea earlier said the subject was raised when its officials met the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, on Monday. Seoul said Mr Kim was also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. However previous talks with North Korea have come to nothing. There has also been no immediate comment from Pyongyang itself. Further news that the leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, came via the leader of the South's delegation, Chung Eui-yong. It would be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea in 2011. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics ""We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,"" Mr Trump said. ""The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world."" President Trump warned of a ""false hope"" The US leader also praised Pyongyang for its decision to take part in the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. But he earlier posted a cautious tweet, warning about a ""false hope"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While the US president said he believed Pyongyang's offer to hold denuclearization talks was ""sincere"" he said it was ""also because of the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea."" Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the US remained ""committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program"". All options were on the table, he said, and US posture towards the regime would not change ""until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearisation"". The US has maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office issued earlier on Tuesday said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. It is difficult to be certain. Since the South made the announcement, there has been no comment from North Korea. Some US and South Korean officials have said that Pyongyang may simply be trying to buy time to develop weapons programmes. There have also been suggestions that Mr Kim is trying to soften the impact of biting sanctions on the impoverished country, seeking food and other aid from overseas. Another factor may be growing diplomatic pressure from North Korea's neighbours, particularly from China - the regional superpower and Pyongyang's only real ally. A series of six-party talks have been held since North Korea decided to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have repeatedly failed. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watches the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile In 2009, North Korea pulled out of the talks and expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country, in response to UN Security Council criticism of a rocket launch. Pyongyang also vowed to resume its nuclear activities. A number of bids to restart the talks collapsed, including in 2012 when North Korea launched another rocket, two weeks after announcing a ""leap day"" agreement with the US. The North said it was commemorating the birth of its founding father, with a new satellite, but it was condemned by others as a provocative test of missile technology. Throughout 2017 Mr Kim ordered a series of incendiary ballistic missile tests, significantly raising the stakes. In response the UN implemented increasingly tough sanctions.

"Alzheimer's disease brain (left) compared to normal (right) Four dementia scientists have shared this year's 1m Euro brain prize for pivotal work that has changed our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Profs John Hardy, Bart De Strooper, Michel Goedert, based in the UK, and Prof Christian Haass, from Germany, unpicked key protein changes that lead to this most common type of dementia. On getting the award, Prof Hardy said he hoped new treatments could be found. He is donating some of his prize money to care for Alzheimer's patients. Much of the drug discovery research that's done today builds on their pioneering work, looking for ways to stop the build-up of damaging proteins, such as amyloid and tau. Alzheimer's and other dementias affect 50 million people around the world, and none of the treatments currently available can stop the disease. Prof Hardy's work includes finding rare, faulty genes linked to Alzheimer's disease. These genetic errors implicated a build-up of amyloid as the event that kick-starts damage to nerve cells in Alzheimer's. Profs Hardy and De Strooper discussed how they would spend the prize money This idea, known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, has been central to Alzheimer's research for nearly 30 years. Together with Prof Haass, who is from the University of Munich, Prof Hardy, who's now at University College London, then discovered how amyloid production changes in people with rare inherited forms of Alzheimer's dementia. How one woman and her family transformed Alzheimer's research Prof Goedert's research at Cambridge University, meanwhile, revealed the importance of another damaging protein, called tau, while Prof De Stooper, who is the new director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, discovered how genetic errors that alter the activity of proteins called secretases can lead to Alzheimer's processes. Dr David Reynolds, Chief Scientific Officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Our congratulations go to all four of these outstanding scientists whose vital contributions have transformed our understanding of the complex causes of Alzheimer's disease. ""The fact that three of these researchers work in the UK reflects the country's position as a global leader in dementia research."" Prof Hardy said he would be donating around 5,000 euros of his share of the 1m euros from theLundbeck Foundation,externalto help campaigns to keep Britain in the EU, and called Brexit a ""unmitigated disaster"" for scientific research. He also pledged his thanks to all the people with Alzheimer's who, over the years, have volunteered to help with dementia research.

"Myprotein is owned by Northwich-based The Hut Group A man has admitted to lying about buying a pack of protein powder containing a dead mouse. Adam Brenton tweeted criticism of Myprotein Impact Diet Whey seller The Hut.com Ltd and contacted local press with his claims. The story was widely republished but ""unequivocal"" evidence proved the mouse was not present at delivery. At the High Court, Brenton, of Manchester, apologised to The Hut.com Ltd and the manufacturer Cend Ltd. Their advocate, Mathilde Groppo, told Mr Justice Nicklin that Brenton had been a regular satisfied customer since 2009. He contacted The Hut.com Ltd in April last year to report he had found a mouse carcass in a packet of the Myprotein powder. Brenton agreed to hand over the items for testing but criticised The Hut.com Ltd's ""awful"" and ""inept"" customer service on Twitter. A newspaper article, which alleged his health had been put at risk, was picked up by the national press and republished in print and on the internet, Ms Groppo said. CCTV from the time of production was reviewed but nothing out of the ordinary was found, she added. Brenton said the bag was opened for three weeks before the mouse was discovered. The animal was tested by Ecolab, a food safety expert endorsed by the University of Liverpool. Ms Groppo said evidence was ""categorical and unequivocal"" that it could not have entered the product during production and was not present at delivery. She said: ""The suggestion that the complainants were at fault for allowing the mouse to enter the protein powder during the production process, thereby potentially causing harm to Mr Brenton and other customers' health, was false."" Brenton told the judge in London he agreed with the evidence and that The Hut.com Ltd's customer service was ""beyond criticism"". He will also pay The Hut.com Ltd and Cend Ltd unspecified damages and legal costs.

"President Putin met FSB special forces in troubled Chechnya in 2011 FSB. The letters are not just familiar to fans of spy thrillers. They have come to symbolise Vladimir Putin's grip on power in Russia. Russia's secretive security agency has gained notoriety around the world with its intelligence and counter-terror operations. But with roots in the Soviet Union's KGB secret police, allegations of state-sanctioned killings and close ties to the president, it faces questions about its true nature and ambitions. What does the FSB do? The Federal Security Service (FSB) was set up in 1995,external, and is tasked with tackling perceived threats to the Russian state. Mr Putin ran the agency before he came to power. It co-operates with foreign police forces in fighting jihadists and some organised crime gangs. FSBs vehicles near a supermarket following an explosion in St Petersburg in December The FSB poured resources into fighting separatist rebels from Chechnya in two wars, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Russia has tense relations with several of its ex-Soviet neighbours. Part of the FSB's job is to prevent any pro-Western ""colour"" uprisings in Russia like Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution and Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution. In 2015 the FSB was involved in a Cold War-style spy swap with Estonia.A Nato member, Estonia accused Russia of having kidnapped Eston Kohver, the security official exchanged for a jailed Russian spy. In 2002 the assassination of an Arab jihadist commander in Chechnya, known as Khattab, was attributed to the FSB. His Chechen comrades said he had received a letter laced with poison. But the Alexander Litvinenko murder case really put the FSB in the international spotlight. Litvinenko (right) publicly accused fellow FSB officers of corruption in 1998 The ex-FSB officer, bitterly critical of President Putin, was poisoned in London with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006.Litvinenko, given asylum in the UK, had been branded a ""traitor"" in Russia. The official UK inquiry concluded that the killers probably had approval from Mr Putin,externaland the then FSB chief, Nikolai Patrushev. Russia rejected the charges and made the main suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, an MP and national hero. Litvinenko had accused the FSB of running a top-secret hit squad called URPO for assassinating enemies. One of its targets, he said, was the powerful oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who died in the UK years after Litvinenko in 2013 in an apparent suicide. Just weeks before Litvinenko died, Russia passed a law giving the FSB authority to act against ""extremists"" and ""terrorists"" abroad. Is Russia really interfering in European states? Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Russia and the art of 'kompromat' Putin friend in 'money laundering ring' Putin's formative German years Some other prominent opponents of Mr Putin, including journalists, have died mysteriously, fuelling speculation about FSB ""hits"". Often the victims had other enemies, however, who could have targeted them. The FSB can officially warn individuals against ""creating the conditions"" for crimes.Critics see that as a KGB-style power of intimidation, enabling the state to stifle dissent. The TV thriller McMafia links Russian spies to organised crime James Norton stars in McMafia,a TV drama based on Misha Glenny's 2008 non-fiction book exploring global crime networks. In their book on the FSB, called The New Nobility, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan say Mr Putin expanded the FSB's powers by enabling it to send agents abroad for special operations, including intelligence gathering. But Russia's equivalent of the British MI6 - the main overseas spy service - is the External Intelligence Service (SVR). Agents of the military spy service GRU also gather intelligence abroad. The FSB is integral to Russia's new doctrine of information warfare, which includes shaping public opinion abroad via social media. US officials believe the Russian state was linked to hacking and disinformationthat targeted voters in the 2016 US presidential election. In March 2017 US authorities accused two FSB officers - Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin - of hacking Yahoo accounts,externaland stealing the data of millions of users. The FSB has powerful legal tools to monitor internet traffic. A technology called Sorm lets it snoop on emails and phone calls; data has to be kept for 12 hours, by law, for possible inspection;virtual private networks (VPNs) and other anonymisation tools are restricted. The Lubyanka - infamous during the Soviet terror - is now the FSB headquarters Mr Soldatov says Russian telecoms providers have to give the FSB direct access to data. The real scope of FSB surveillance at any one time is not clear. The journalist says that, as with the Communist KGB, the fear of being spied on is a powerful weapon in itself. The headquarters in central Moscow is the Lubyanka - a symbol of FSB power. The KGB interrogated political prisoners there in Soviet times. The FSB's head Alexander Bortnikov reports directly to President Putin. In 2000, Mr Bortnikov's predecessor Nikolai Patrushev called his FSB operatives ""modern nobles"". On becoming president, Mr Putin gave top posts to former spies from St Petersburg. Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a leading Russian sociologist, says that ""we are witnessing a restoration of the power of the KGB"" under Mr Putin. During his first term as president, about one-third of government officials were ""siloviki"" - or ""security guys"", she said. Most of the elite - including Mr Bortnikov - are now subject toEU and/or US sanctions because of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.Most have acquired huge fortunes and control key Russian resources. The FSB's vintage car collection includes a 1922 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost In the 1990s Mr Putin oversaw foreign trade in St Petersburg and some of his associates from that time have been linked to organised crime. Those links are documented by US researcher Karen Dawisha in her book Putin's Kleptocracy. The allegations also surfaced in the Litvinenko inquiry and ina major Spanish police investigation into the Russian mafia. The Spanish prosecutor, Jose Grinda, told US officials that Russia's security services ""control OC (organised crime) in Russia"" and ""the FSB is 'absorbing' the Russian mafia"".,external Reporting by the BBC's Laurence Peter.

"This video can not be played Former England rugby league international Scott Moore charged at officers after a high-speed chase A professional rugby player, Tasered six times after driving at 150mph in a police chase, has been jailed. Scott Moore crashed into a house in Leigh and fought officers, threatening one with a Taser he stole from them. The ex-England rugby league star, 30, used ""his size and experience on the rugby field"" to evade arrest, Greater Manchester Police said. He was jailed for 23 months at Bolton Crown Court after admitting dangerous driving and assault. Moore, of Ranworth Drive, Lowton, Wigan, was disqualified from driving for two years. Moore became the youngest player to appear in Super League, playing for St Helens at 16 years old Police spotted Moore in the early hours of 14 October 2016 driving a black Mercedes at speed along Chaddock Lane towards the East Lancashire Road. He refused to pull over, sparking a pursuit during which he overtook a lorry at 100mph on a stretch of roadworks which had a speed limit of 30mph. He then accelerated at more than 150mph into a housing estate in Leigh and crashed into the wall of a house before stopping at a dead end, police said. Moore elbowed an officer and ""violently resisted arrest in a struggle lasting 50 minutes"" during which he was Tasered six times but ""kept rising to his feet to fight and charge at officers"". At one point, the former St Helens, Widnes and Wakefield hooker grabbed the Taser's wires after being stunned and removed them from his body. He then grabbed the Taser in a ""tug of war"" with the officer, shouting: ""You're getting it now!"" while pointing it at the officer's face, police said. The terrified officer fought with Moore to release it from his hand and the other officer struck him numerous times. Moore eventually dropped the Taser and, following a further struggle, was detained. The officers had never in their careers ""been so scared nor witnessed such a violent individual"", Det Con Lynsey Watson-Perry said. One officer had to undergo surgery. ""Whatever level of force he is used to displaying on the pitch, this was not a game - people's lives were in danger"", she added.

"The An-26 - like this one in an archive photo - is a twin-engine turboprop civilian and military transport aircraft A Russian military transport plane has crashed in Syria killing more than 30 people, the defence ministry says. The An-26 plane crashed during landing at Hmeimim airbase, near the coastal city of Latakia, the ministry is quoted as saying by Russian media. It says all 39 military personnel on board died, not 32 as earlier reported. The plane was not fired upon, the ministry says, and preliminary data suggests a technical malfunction could have caused the crash. An investigation is now under way. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Meanwhile, medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. In a separate development, UN war crimes investigators say air strikes in Syria by both Russia and the US-led coalition killed large numbers of civilians last year. Why is there a war in Syria? The Russian defence ministry says the An-26 crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT). It says the plane went down about 500m (1640ft) from the runway. A special commission is to be set up to investigate the crash. On 7 January,Russian forces said they had foiled a drone attack on Hmeimim. This was just a week after Russian warplanes were damaged at the airbase in a rebel mortar attack. Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces to recover much lost ground. Russia launched its military operation in September 2015, saying it was acting upon a request by President Assad. Images said to show the wreckage of Russia's Sukhoi-25 plane shot down over Idlib on 3 February Here are the confirmed air force losses: Feb 2018:A Sukhoi-25 warplane is shot down in a rebel-held area in north-western province of Idlib.The pilots ejects but later dies in a ground fight Dec 2017: Shelling damages several planes at the Hmeimim airbase, with two Russian servicemen killed Dec 2016:A Tu-154 carrying 92 people - including army musicians - crashes into the Black Seaafter taking off for Syria from Sochi, killing all on board Aug 2016: All five people on board a helicopter are killed when it is shot down over Idlib Nov 2015:Turkish warplanes shoot down a Sukhoi-24. One pilot is killed, the other rescued. The incident sparks a severe deterioration of bilateral relations The attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Local medics said they were treating a number of people who had breathing problems. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Meanwhile, Russia - a key ally of the Syrian government - offered rebels safe passage out of the area. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space They said they found that an attack by the US-coalition on a school near the city of Raqqa last March killed 150 local residents - many times more than Washington had admitted to. The investigators also said Russian air strikes on a market in Atareb, west of Aleppo, killed at least 84 people last November. Their report talked too of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces, and war crimes allegedly committed by their rebel opponents.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 last August A lorry driver has been convicted of causing the deaths of eight people in a crash on the M1. Ryszard Masierak, 31, was at twice the drink-drive limit and had stopped in the inside lane when he was involved in the crash with a minibus and another lorry near Newport Pagnell. He was found guilty of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The jury at Reading Crown Court is still deliberating charges against the other lorry driver, David Wagstaff. Masierak was also convicted of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving after the crash last August. Wagstaff, 54, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, denies the same charges. Ryszard Masierak stopped in the inside lane of the M1 at about 02:57 on 26 August The trial heard Masierak's vehicle was stopped in the carriageway for about 12 minutes - an act described by prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC as ""as flagrant as it was dangerous"". The eight people killed were all travelling in the minibus, which was carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris. The six men and two women were driver Cyriac Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. Four other passengers - including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the crash - spent weeks in hospital afterwards. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak, a Polish national, stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. He admitted he had consumed alcohol. He told the court he stopped becausehe was sweating, felt weak and had a headacheand had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from  what he described as a ""small coma"" when the crash happened. Wagstaff has been released on continuing bail.

"Ms Schiappa told French media the government had decided to set the age of consent at 15 France plans to fix the legal age of sexual consent at 15, meaning sex with someone younger than that would be considered rape. Equality Minister MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa welcomed the move, which follows advice from doctors and legal experts. Currently, prosecutors must prove sex with someone under 15 was forced in order to bring rape charges. The change comes amid uproar over two recent cases of men accused of having sex with 11-year-old girls. Under the existing legislation, if there is no violence or coercion proved,offenders may only be charged with sexual abuse of a minor and not rape,external. This has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of â¬75,000 (Â£66,000; $87,000). Sentences are the same for sexual assaults of minors and non-minors,external, but rape convictions carry much harsher punishments. One French woman in eight has been raped, study says French plans for anti-street harassment law The government is to approve the new age limit as part of a package of other laws against sexual violence and harassment in the coming weeks. It had been discussing whether to set the age as 13 or 15, which is what groups fighting violence against children had campaigned for. Ms Schiappa told AFP news agency that she was ""very glad"" that the higher age was chosen. The limit is also supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Minister of Solidarity and Health AgnÃ¨s Buzyn saidsetting a legal age of sexual consent would allow a ""collective awareness"",externaland that everyone would see what was ""legal and illegal"", Le Figaro newspaper reports (in French). President Macron has expressed support to setting 15 as the age of consent Last November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of rape after a court determined his 11-year-old victim had not been subjected to ""constraint, threat, violence or surprise"". In another case, a court initially said a 28-year-old man should face charges of sexual assault, and not rape, after saying the victim was not physically forced to have sex. But the same court reversed its decision last month, saying the accused should indeed face rape charges. Legislation varies across Europe, withcountries setting different legal ages of consent,external: 14 years old: Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal 15: Greece, Poland, Sweden 16: Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Russia 17: Cyprus In the UK the age of sexual consent is 16, but children under the age of 13 have additional legal protections that declare they can never consent to sexual activity.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. The United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The World is watching and waiting!"" ""May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vice-President Mike Pence added: ""All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization."" Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea's take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea's apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. ""While the dialogues continue,"" the South says, ""the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations."" (Surely not Pyongyang's words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. These were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had ""somewhat shared"" views on some issues.

"Former BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull has revealed he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The 62-year-old said it was found in November and cancer has spread to his legs, hips, pelvis and ribs. Turnbulltold the Radio Times,externalhe wanted to encourage people to get tested, saying: ""Maybe if I'd got it earlier and stopped it at the prostate, I'd be in a much better state."" He said he had put long-term aches and pains down to ""old age"". The interview was conducted bySian Williams, Turnbull's former colleague on the Breakfast sofa,who had a double mastectomy for breast cancer in 2014.

Turnbull said in his interview he had had prostate tests when he was aged 40 and 50. But he said he was ""cross"" for having prided himself on not visiting a GP in four years and only sought help when his pains could no longer be alleviated with pills. How to talk to family about prostate cancer Awareness 'dangerously low' in British men Warning signs to look out for The father of three said after being diagnosed the ""first few days were probably the worst days of my life"". ""The GP said, 'It's clear you have prostate cancer and that it's spread to the bone'. And all of a sudden you're in this dark chasm."" Turnbull said it ""saddens me that I'm not going to be around as much as I thought with my wife and family... I realised if things progress as they do on average, I can't plan beyond 12 years"". He said he was diagnosed while recording an episode of The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer on Channel 4. ""I had the disease and didn't know it,"" he said.

"The ousted former leader of the UK Independence Party, Henry Bolton, says he is setting up a new political party. Mr Bolton, who was voted out last month at a meeting of UKIP members, said his new party would ""campaign unceasingly for our full independence from the EU"". He said ""there is an urgent need for a new way of doing politics that truly involves communities"". TheOneNation,externalparty's structures and management ""mirror some of the changes that I sought to bring to UKIP"". UKIP members voted to sack Mr Bolton as leader last month at an emergency general meeting after controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. Henry Bolton sacked as UKIP leader Gerard Batten has taken over as interim leader, with a UKIP leadership election due within 90 days. Henry Bolton was leader less than five months Mr Bolton was elected in September in the wake of UKIP's disastrous performance in last year's general election. He was the party's fourth leader in 18 months. He had replaced Paul Nuttall, who quit after the 2017 general election - which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015. In an explanation of the need for a new party, Mr Bolton said: ""There is a need for a truly professional political party that believes in Britain, that preserves our national identity, culture, heritage and confidence and talks our great nation up rather than down; a party dedicated to the full independence of the UK in all areas of law, government and public administration."" He added that UKIP had held that position until the 2016 referendum.

"Hamilton opened last year with Jamael Westman (centre) in the title role Hit hip-hop musical Hamilton has made Olivier awards history by receiving a record 13 nominations. The West End show received two more nominations than the 11 Hairspray and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child received in 2008 and 2017 respectively. Two of its nominations are in the best actor in a musical category, where Giles Terera and Jamael Westman are both recognised. The Ferryman gets eight nominations, including one for best new play. Catherine Tate will host this year's awards, to be held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 8 April. Giles Terera (centre) has received one of the show's 13 Olivier nominations Hamilton uses rap and hip-hop to tell the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, played by Jamael Westman in London. Terera plays Hamilton's nemesis Aaron Burr in the show, which opened in London last year after enjoying huge success in New York. Three of the show's Olivier nominations come in the same category - best supporting actor in a musical - meaning that the most awards it can actually win is 10. Hamilton's creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has expressed delight in a tweet paying tribute to his musical's London team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Public Health England has not said what the substance was A Russian man convicted of spying for Britain and his daughter are critically ill after apparently being exposed to a mystery substance in Wiltshire. The incident has drawn comparisons to thecase of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London after being poisoned by a radioactive substance. So how will officials find out what Sergei and Yulia Skripal were exposed to and whether they were poisoned? Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said in a case like this hospitals and other agencies would be working together to find out what happened. Doctors will assess the pair's symptoms and carry out tests on them. Blood tests will assess liver and kidney function, while urine may provide clues for substances excreted more rapidly, he said. Some of these tests may be done in the hospital where they are being treated, but labs at Guy's Hospital, in London, and in Birmingham, could also be used because they are specially equipped to screen for a wide range of substances. And there is also the government's chemical defence laboratory at Porton Down - coincidentally also in Wiltshire - which has state-of-the-art equipment to help detect trace amounts of chemicals. But some of the tests could take several days to complete. Russia 'has no information' on collapsed spy Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Prof Hay said at this stage it was too early to speculate on what the substance might be. But he said the fact that Public Health England had said there was no wider risk to the public suggested there might have been ""some very specific contact with the substance and limited spread"". Part of the investigation will look at where this contact may have taken place. A number of city-centre locations in Salisbury have been cordoned off, including a nearby Zizzi restaurant that police said had been closed ""as a precaution"". Teams in protective gear have also been hosing down the street. Prof Hay said knowing what had been used to decontaminate the streets could give clues to what officials suspected the substance was. An ex-radiation biologist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was unlikely the substance was radioactive - as in the case of Mr Litvinenko - because the symptoms developed too quickly. Instead, a chemical source was more likely, but a biological contamination of food or the environment was also possible. But if it was chemical this would leave a wide range of possibilities: from drugs designed for chemical warfare to artificial highs. ""We could be looking at self-inflicted accidental overdoses or a targeted attack."" A nearby Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury has been closed as a precaution The fact police have declared the case a ""major incident"" also raises questions, Prof Hay said. ""Was it... because of who was affected or because of the rate of onset of symptoms?"" And the circumstances in which the pair were found could also shed light on what happened, he said. ""Ideally it would help to question someone about this, but if they have collapsed you have to test for substances. ""In the end it will be signs and symptoms and specific blood, saliva or sputum, urine, and possible faecal testing that will tell us what it was."" But could their condition have been caused by something other than a substance - perhaps a bacterial or viral infection? Prof Hay said given the apparent speed of the symptoms, this seemed less likely. But it was still not known how the pair were feeling hours earlier. ""So a microbiology lab may well do a range of screening tests to check for a bacterial cause. But this will depend on what the clinical team feels is appropriate,"" he said. The case has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko In the case of Mr Litvinenko it took weeks to establish that the cause of his death was deliberate poisoning, believed to have been administered in a cup of tea. At first hospitals were unable to detect any radiation poisoning. It was eventually scientists at Britain's top-secret nuclear research site at Aldermaston in Berkshire who discovered he was poisoned by polonium-210. And it was close to a decade later that apublic inquiry in 2016 concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has said it has ""no information"" about what Mr Skripal and his daughter were exposed to but says it is willing to co-operate in any investigation. UK police are not yet saying a crime has been committed. It is likely to be a while before we know what happened and why. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"A tent has been erected around the bench where the pair was found unconscious It is a city known mostly for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge. But as it finds itself at the centre of a modern-day mystery, what do the residents of Salisbury make of its new-found fame? Quiet. Normal. Quintessentially English. Words like these make medieval Salisbury seem an unlikely home for a former Russian spy. And yet on Sunday, this small city in Wiltshire found itself the topic of global conversation when current resident Sergei Skripal became ill near the main shopping centre. It would probably not have been newsworthy in itself, except it transpiredhe was once a military intelligence colonelwho was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK's intelligence service, MI6. When the 66-year-old and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripa were found unconscious on a bench near The Maltings, police soon revealed they believed the pair had been exposed to an ""unknown substance"". Now, around the seat where they were found, a tent has been erected. The nearby branch of Zizzi is closed - a tight-lipped police officer guarding the door. The Mill pub, about 200m from the restaurant, is also shut. Salisbury is home to about 40,000 people The city is typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge But far from perturbed by the activity unfolding around them, residents and workers simply zigzag around the cordons. People are more worried about the local pie shop being closed, says Leuene Jackman, peering over the police tape at the forensics team. ""Quite a few shops have been closed, it won't be good for business,"" she remarks. ""You just think this sort of thing happens in other parts of the country. ""This is such a quiet city."" Stall holder Amanda Barlow says it's ""business as usual"" Typically known for its cathedral and proximity to Stonehenge, the city is one of the UK's smallest with a population of about 40,000 people. It has been home to many celebrities with Sting, Madonna and Guy Ritchie among those living in nearby villages. The late author Terry Pratchett and former prime minster Edward Heath also called Salisbury home. Now a far less famous resident has given the city the dubious honour of making it an unwitting backdrop to an unfolding mystery that has the hallmarks of a spy novel. ""It's just weird,"" says Janice Parks on one of the main shopping thoroughfares. ""Salisbury is just so quintessentially English."" Salisbury's market was bustling despite the drama She hurries on, rejoining the other shoppers navigating the narrow alleys and busy marketplace. ""It's business as usual really,"" says stall holder, Amanda Barlow. ""People have been looking up into the sky a bit more than normal, watching the circling helicopter. ""It's such a sleepy, tight-knit place. We were quite surprised but it hasn't put people off visiting."" The hot topic of conversation in the cafes and shops has certainly been about ""that Russian spy"" - who despite the close-knit community clichÃ©, seems relatively unknown to those milling around the streets. ""It goes to show we don't know who we live next door to,"" muses Penny Muxworthy, who lives just outside the city. ""People have jobs that might necessitate them [keeping from] people what it is that they do. ""It could happen anywhere."" The world's media has camped out around the police cordons Penny Muxworthy said ""it goes to show we don't know who we live next door to"" Outside the Mill pub, Frank Carter, agrees. ""Salisbury is out of the way isn't it,"" says the 87-year-old, who has lived there his whole life. ""You wouldn't expect it here."" But many remain seemingly unruffled by the news. ""I'm not nervous for my own safety,"" says Sue Doe, smoking a cigarette a stone's throw from the closed Zizzi restaurant. ""I'm just interested to know what's happened."" Others are less keen about the attention it has attracted. ""You're not from the telly are you? I don't want to be on the telly,"" said a man who did not want to be named. ""There's cameramen and [media] on every street corner, you can't move for them."" For others, the publicity is a welcome moment in the spotlight. ""Well, it's definitely put Salisbury on the map,"" quips Doris Bright, before going about her day. Ex-Russian spy collapsed with daughter Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel?

"Public Health England has not said what the substance was A Russian man convicted of spying for Britain and his daughter are critically ill after apparently being exposed to a mystery substance in Wiltshire. The incident has drawn comparisons to thecase of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London after being poisoned by a radioactive substance. So how will officials find out what Sergei and Yulia Skripal were exposed to and whether they were poisoned? Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said in a case like this hospitals and other agencies would be working together to find out what happened. Doctors will assess the pair's symptoms and carry out tests on them. Blood tests will assess liver and kidney function, while urine may provide clues for substances excreted more rapidly, he said. Some of these tests may be done in the hospital where they are being treated, but labs at Guy's Hospital, in London, and in Birmingham, could also be used because they are specially equipped to screen for a wide range of substances. And there is also the government's chemical defence laboratory at Porton Down - coincidentally also in Wiltshire - which has state-of-the-art equipment to help detect trace amounts of chemicals. But some of the tests could take several days to complete. Russia 'has no information' on collapsed spy Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Prof Hay said at this stage it was too early to speculate on what the substance might be. But he said the fact that Public Health England had said there was no wider risk to the public suggested there might have been ""some very specific contact with the substance and limited spread"". Part of the investigation will look at where this contact may have taken place. A number of city-centre locations in Salisbury have been cordoned off, including a nearby Zizzi restaurant that police said had been closed ""as a precaution"". Teams in protective gear have also been hosing down the street. Prof Hay said knowing what had been used to decontaminate the streets could give clues to what officials suspected the substance was. An ex-radiation biologist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was unlikely the substance was radioactive - as in the case of Mr Litvinenko - because the symptoms developed too quickly. Instead, a chemical source was more likely, but a biological contamination of food or the environment was also possible. But if it was chemical this would leave a wide range of possibilities: from drugs designed for chemical warfare to artificial highs. ""We could be looking at self-inflicted accidental overdoses or a targeted attack."" A nearby Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury has been closed as a precaution The fact police have declared the case a ""major incident"" also raises questions, Prof Hay said. ""Was it... because of who was affected or because of the rate of onset of symptoms?"" And the circumstances in which the pair were found could also shed light on what happened, he said. ""Ideally it would help to question someone about this, but if they have collapsed you have to test for substances. ""In the end it will be signs and symptoms and specific blood, saliva or sputum, urine, and possible faecal testing that will tell us what it was."" But could their condition have been caused by something other than a substance - perhaps a bacterial or viral infection? Prof Hay said given the apparent speed of the symptoms, this seemed less likely. But it was still not known how the pair were feeling hours earlier. ""So a microbiology lab may well do a range of screening tests to check for a bacterial cause. But this will depend on what the clinical team feels is appropriate,"" he said.

"Thousands of homes are without water for a third day in parts of the UK after a sudden rise in temperature caused frozen pipes to burst. Companies have been supplying bottled water while they reconnect customers in London, Kent, Sussex and Wales. South East Water says about 1,000 homes and businesses still have no supply. The industry regulator Ofwat said it understood the recent weather was an issue but added suppliers had ""fallen well short"" on forward planning. London Mayor Sadiq Khan also criticised the companies after thousands were left without water in London and schools were forced to close on Monday. No water? Can you claim compensation? MPs have called for a public inquiry into the matter and compensation for those who have been affected. This video can not be played Mum in South London: ""Five kids and no water"" Water companies say a thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks.  Many have set up bottled water banks. In Wales, 1,500 properties remain without water,Welsh Water said. The company warned water could be discoloured when supplies are reconnected. Thames Water, which supplies water to London, says around 5,000 customers are still cut off.

"Ms Huby said wading through snowdrifts was ""dangerous"" Villagers cut off by snow have been forced to walk through 12ft snowdrifts to get food. Deb Huby, of Nenthead, near Alston, Cumbria, has been snowed in for six days and without heating for three. She said she and her partner Tim Gallagher had to walk three miles, often sinking waist-high in snow, to get food as supplies were running low. The 46-year-old said conditions had been horrific and she feared her cottage would be ""buried"". Ms Huby, who suffers from anxiety and had run out of her medication, said: ""I've been in this area 20 years and I've seen some bad winters but nothing like this. ""We couldn't even get out of the door and at one point the snowdrifts were 20ft high. There seemed no end to it."" Deb Huby said some snowdrifts could have buried her cottage She said there were nine people, including two young children, cut off in the three cottages on her road but there was ""a real community spirit"". ""The communication has been brilliant and we wouldn't let anybody be stuck. ""As the snow piled up I was starting to think it could cover the house."" Villagers have had to ""wade"" through snowdrifts to get food parcels Ms Huby said she had no choice but to ""wade"" through 12ft snowdrifts as they were running short of supplies. She said: ""It did get to points when it was dangerous"".

"The portion sizes of some of Britain's most popular foods are to be cut, with health officials telling the public it is time ""to get on a diet"". Public Health England is targeting pizzas, ready meals, processed meat and takeaways, in a new obesity drive. The government agency has also urged the food industry to start using healthier ingredients and encourage the public to opt for lower calorie foods. It is all part of a drive to cut calorie consumption by 20% by 2024. The target will apply to 13 different food groups, responsible for a fifth of the calorie intake of children. It comes on top of: the sugar reduction programme, launched last year, which is targeting nine different food groups the sugar drinks levy, which comes into force next month Combined, these three measures mean health officials are taking direct action to influence the consumption of foods responsible for half of children's calories. Public 'tricked' into buying unhealthy food Third of adults 'underestimate calories' Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate But PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie said the steps were as much about influencing the diets of adults. ""Britain needs to go on a diet. Children and adults routinely eat too many calories, and it's why so many are overweight or obese."" Food manufacturers, supermarkets, takeaways and fast-food outlets have been told to reduce the calories in the following foods: savoury biscuits and crackers speciality breads, such as ciabatta with olives cooking sauces and dressings crisps and savoury snacks egg products potato products meat products, such as pies, pastries, sausages and burgers pasta, rice and noodles ready meals and takeaways dips pizza food-to-go, such as sandwiches soups If action is not taken, PHE said, it would be prepared to ask the government to legislate. It would be strictly monitoring progress by looking at which products people were buying and would be prepared to ""name and shame"" individual companies not pulling their weight. The agency is also launching a campaign encouraging adults to consume 400 calories at breakfast and 600 each at lunch and dinner. It is being seen as a rough guide for consumers to follow when they buy meals away from home. A quarter of food is now bought from cafes, restaurants, takeaways or as food-to-go from shops. This video can not be played Sophie said: ""Before that app I didn't care how many calories I ate a day"" PHE said major groups such as McDonald's, Subway and Greggs would be promoting foods that kept people within these guidelines. Currently adults consume between 200 and 300 calories more than they should each day. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said the 400-600-600 tip would make it easier for ""people to make healthier choices"" by being able to judge what they should be eating in each sitting. ""To get traction on this, the big-selling things need to change,"" she said. ""A few healthy options on the end of a menu won't help solve the nation's obesity problem - we need the regular, everyday products to change."" It is recommended that women should eat no more than 2,000 calories a day, while men should limit their intake to 2,500. Cheese festival runs out of cheese Populists vie for power after Italy vote The killer disease with no vaccine For children, it varies depending on age. A four-year-old should consume no more than 1,300, while for males aged 17 and 18 it is about 3,000, but overweight and obese children are consuming up to 500 calories more than that. The move has been backed by experts. Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it was a ""bold and necessary"" move. He said over the past 40 years there had been a ""creep"" in portion sizes, with pizzas and hamburgers ""simply much bigger than they were in our parents' time"". ""The availability of fast food at pocket money prices and the advertising of unhealthy food and drinks to children add to the problem,"" he added. Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright said it was the right approach and industry was fully supportive. ""The FDF and its members take their responsibility in tackling obesity seriously,"" he said.

"The woman was found dead at the family home in Twickenham A woman has been found dead with stab wounds, an hour after the bodies of her husband and two sons were discovered at the foot of cliffs in East Sussex. Police found the woman, in her 40s, at the family home in Twickenham, south-west London, shortly before 18:00 GMT on Monday. Her death is being treated as murder. Sussex Police were called after three bodies - thought to be the woman's sons, aged seven and 10, and husband, 57 - were found at Birling Gap beach. Scotland Yard said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. The woman's husband and two sons were found at Birling Gap in East Sussex Detectives were called to South Road in Twickenham after concerns were raised for the welfare of the occupants. Post-mortem examinations will take place in due course, they said. Sussex Police said it recovered a vehicle near to where the three bodies were found at about 17:00 on Monday. Forensic officers are carrying out investigations at the house The house in Twickenham has been sealed off as forensic officers carry out their investigations.

"The An-26 - like this one in an archive photo - is a twin-engine turboprop civilian and military transport aircraft A Russian military transport plane has crashed in Syria killing more than 30 people, the defence ministry says. The An-26 plane crashed during landing at Hmeimim airbase, near the coastal city of Latakia, the ministry is quoted as saying by Russian media. It says all 39 military personnel on board died, not 32 as earlier reported. The plane was not fired upon, the ministry says, and preliminary data suggests a technical malfunction could have caused the crash. An investigation is now under way. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Meanwhile, medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. In a separate development, UN war crimes investigators say air strikes in Syria by both Russia and the US-led coalition killed large numbers of civilians last year. Why is there a war in Syria? The Russian defence ministry says the An-26 crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT). It says the plane went down about 500m (1640ft) from the runway. A special commission is to be set up to investigate the crash. On 7 January,Russian forces said they had foiled a drone attack on Hmeimim.

"Danish toymaker Lego has reported its first sales decline in 13 years Too many Lego bricks is a problem many parents will sympathise with, but now the toy firm itself has admitted it has made too many. The company said sales and profits had fallen for the first time in 13 years, blaming the weak performance on having to sell off excess stock cheaply. A Lego spokeswoman said it had ""too much"" stock in warehouses and shops. ""There wasn't enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness,"" she added. The Danish toymaker said dealing with the stock issue, as well as a drop in sales in Europe and North America, had dragged down its performance last year. This video can not be played Kristiansen family archive Lego Group chief executive Niels Christiansen said there was ""no quick fix"" and it would take the firm ""some time"" to grow long-term. Why is Lego not clicking with customers? Lego goes green with sugarcane plastic 'Let children play to learn work skills' The weak performance comes afterLego cut 1,400 jobs worldwide in September, saying its business needed a ""reset"". Revenue for 2017 dropped by 8% to 35bn Danish kroner (Â£4.2bn; $5.8bn), compared to 37.9bn kroner in 2016. Pre-tax profits slid 18% to 10.4bn kroner in 2017. ""During the year, revenues declined, however consumer sales - or sales in stores - remained flat. This shows that consumers (kids and their parents) are continuing to buy from retailers,"" said Lego's spokeswoman.

However, he said the firm's performance had improved towards the end of the year, with sales growing in seven of its 12 largest markets in December. The company has been increasing sales in new markets, particularly in Asia. Lego said that it saw ""strong potential"" in its business in China, where sales enjoyed double digit growth last year. ""However, to reduce retail inventories, we shipped less to our retailers than what the consumers are buying."" Lego opened its first Asian factory in China in 2016 ""We started 2018 in better shape and during the coming year we will stabilise the business by continuing to invest in great products, effective global marketing and improved execution,"" said Mr Christiansen. In September, Lego said its half-year results had suffered because it had stretched itself too thin by diversifying into products that were not toys, such as the Lego movies. Lego chairman Jorgen Knudstorp said at the time that adding complexity to the company had made it harder for the toymaker to grow further. He said that the firm had pressed ""the reset button"" for the group with the aim of building ""a smaller and less complex organisation"".

"Charlie Pope was described as a ""lovely young man"" by the head of his former school Ponteland High The father of a student who was found dead in a Manchester canal has called for safety railings to be built alongside waterways in the city. Charlie Pope's bodywas found after an underwater search of the Rochdale Canalin Manchester city centre on 1 March. The 19-year-old, of Ponteland in Northumberland, had left the Zombie Shack on New Wakefield Street at 02:30. His father Nick Pope has backed a petition calling for railings which has so far been signed by 15,000 people. Charlie, a Manchester University social sciences student who was living in West Didsbury, went missing after becoming separated from friends. His father told BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are not going to stop - we don't want anyone to go through we have been through."" Charlie Pope's body was found in the Canal Street close to Whitworth Street West Police took Mr Pope to the spot where Charlie's body had been found. ""It was icy and there were no barriers. I was astonished how dangerous it was,"" he said. ""I had no idea - people are stumbling out of bars and falling into canals. We could put up barriers in key areas where all the bars are."" He added: ""If this was a company the Health and Safety Executive would have shut it years ago."" Manchester city councillor Pat Karney said certain safety measures could be introduced along the canal Manchester city councillor Pat Karney said the whole canal network could not be fenced off but certain measures could be introduced. He said: ""We have done it at the top of the village area as we had a particular problem and so far it has stopped fatalities up there. ""But I will look at the petition and talk to them and see what measures we can come up with.""

"Public Health England has not said what the substance was A Russian man convicted of spying for Britain and his daughter are critically ill after apparently being exposed to a mystery substance in Wiltshire. The incident has drawn comparisons to thecase of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London after being poisoned by a radioactive substance. So how will officials find out what Sergei and Yulia Skripal were exposed to and whether they were poisoned? Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said in a case like this hospitals and other agencies would be working together to find out what happened. Doctors will assess the pair's symptoms and carry out tests on them. Blood tests will assess liver and kidney function, while urine may provide clues for substances excreted more rapidly, he said. Some of these tests may be done in the hospital where they are being treated, but labs at Guy's Hospital, in London, and in Birmingham, could also be used because they are specially equipped to screen for a wide range of substances. And there is also the government's chemical defence laboratory at Porton Down - coincidentally also in Wiltshire - which has state-of-the-art equipment to help detect trace amounts of chemicals. But some of the tests could take several days to complete. Russia 'has no information' on collapsed spy Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Prof Hay said at this stage it was too early to speculate on what the substance might be. But he said the fact that Public Health England had said there was no wider risk to the public suggested there might have been ""some very specific contact with the substance and limited spread"". Part of the investigation will look at where this contact may have taken place. A number of city-centre locations in Salisbury have been cordoned off, including a nearby Zizzi restaurant that police said had been closed ""as a precaution"". Teams in protective gear have also been hosing down the street. Prof Hay said knowing what had been used to decontaminate the streets could give clues to what officials suspected the substance was. An ex-radiation biologist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was unlikely the substance was radioactive - as in the case of Mr Litvinenko - because the symptoms developed too quickly. Instead, a chemical source was more likely, but a biological contamination of food or the environment was also possible. But if it was chemical this would leave a wide range of possibilities: from drugs designed for chemical warfare to artificial highs. ""We could be looking at self-inflicted accidental overdoses or a targeted attack."" A nearby Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury has been closed as a precaution The fact police have declared the case a ""major incident"" also raises questions, Prof Hay said. ""Was it... because of who was affected or because of the rate of onset of symptoms?"" And the circumstances in which the pair were found could also shed light on what happened, he said. ""Ideally it would help to question someone about this, but if they have collapsed you have to test for substances. ""In the end it will be signs and symptoms and specific blood, saliva or sputum, urine, and possible faecal testing that will tell us what it was."" But could their condition have been caused by something other than a substance - perhaps a bacterial or viral infection? Prof Hay said given the apparent speed of the symptoms, this seemed less likely. But it was still not known how the pair were feeling hours earlier. ""So a microbiology lab may well do a range of screening tests to check for a bacterial cause. But this will depend on what the clinical team feels is appropriate,"" he said. The case has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko In the case of Mr Litvinenko it took weeks to establish that the cause of his death was deliberate poisoning, believed to have been administered in a cup of tea. At first hospitals were unable to detect any radiation poisoning. It was eventually scientists at Britain's top-secret nuclear research site at Aldermaston in Berkshire who discovered he was poisoned by polonium-210. And it was close to a decade later that apublic inquiry in 2016 concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has said it has ""no information"" about what Mr Skripal and his daughter were exposed to but says it is willing to co-operate in any investigation. UK police are not yet saying a crime has been committed. It is likely to be a while before we know what happened and why. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Vauxhall boss warns of Brexit risk to Ellesmere Port The head of Vauxhall has said lack of clarity over Brexit threatens the future of its Ellesmere Port operation. Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen, said clarity over the terms of the UK's departure was ""a big concern"". He told the BBC that uncertainty undermined Ellesmere Port's chances of getting more work after 2021. ""We cannot invest in a world of uncertainty,"" he said. He added: ""No one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome."" Speaking to the BBC at the Geneva Motor Show, Mr Tavares said the decision on whether or not to give Ellesmere more work would need to be taken ""very soon"". A spokesperson for the government's Business Department said: ""The Business Secretary [Greg Clark] has met with Vauxhall's senior management team on a number of occasions to understand their plans for their Ellesmere Port plant. ""The government is continuing to engage with PSA on their future strategic plans for the UK. "" The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said: ""Of course, the government position on Brexit is creating uncertainty for major manufacturing companies but this should not be used by Mr Tavares to raise the fear of closure of Ellesmere Port. ""The UK market is vitally important to Peugeot and if he wants to protect that market share he should openly commit to new models in both Ellesmere Port and Luton. ""Our Vauxhall plants are among the most productive in the PSA family, and the products our members make are among the most popular vehicles in the country."" Vauxhall chief warns over Brexit Mr Tavares said: ""I would like to praise our UK people in terms of their efficiency, but at the same time we need clarity. ""This is not a problem for the PSA Group, this is a problem for the whole UK automotive industry."" PSA said last year it was committed to keep making the Astra at Ellesmere Port, but it has also said that manufacturing costs at Ellesmere are higher than other plants it owns. However, it said in January that it was cutting another 250 jobs at Ellesmere Port on top of 400 cuts it announced in October. Vauxhall employs about 4,500 people in the UK, with about 1,800 at Ellesmere Port. The company also has a factory at Luton, which makes vans. In August last year, PSA became Europe's second-biggest carmaker, after Volkswagen, when it completed the purchase of Vauxhall and German brand Opel from General Motors.

"Charlie Pope was described as a ""lovely young man"" by the head of his former school Ponteland High The father of a student who was found dead in a Manchester canal has called for safety railings to be built alongside waterways in the city. Charlie Pope's bodywas found after an underwater search of the Rochdale Canalin Manchester city centre on 1 March. The 19-year-old, of Ponteland in Northumberland, had left the Zombie Shack on New Wakefield Street at 02:30. His father Nick Pope has backed a petition calling for railings which has so far been signed by 15,000 people. Charlie, a Manchester University social sciences student who was living in West Didsbury, went missing after becoming separated from friends. His father told BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are not going to stop - we don't want anyone to go through we have been through."" Charlie Pope's body was found in the Canal Street close to Whitworth Street West Police took Mr Pope to the spot where Charlie's body had been found. ""It was icy and there were no barriers. I was astonished how dangerous it was,"" he said. ""I had no idea - people are stumbling out of bars and falling into canals. We could put up barriers in key areas where all the bars are."" He added: ""If this was a company the Health and Safety Executive would have shut it years ago."" Manchester city councillor Pat Karney said certain safety measures could be introduced along the canal Manchester city councillor Pat Karney said the whole canal network could not be fenced off but certain measures could be introduced. He said: ""We have done it at the top of the village area as we had a particular problem and so far it has stopped fatalities up there.

"Experts confirmed the bottle was jettisoned as part of a German oceanographic experiment in 1886 A Perth family has found the world's oldest known message in a bottle, almost 132 years after it was thrown into the sea, Australian experts say. Tonya Illman picked up the bottle while going for a walk around sand dunes on a remote beach in West Australia. Her husband Kym Illman told the BBC they found some paper in the bottle but had ""no idea"" what it was until they took it home and dried it in the oven. Experts have confirmed it is an authentic message from a German ship. The note in the bottle, which was dated 12 June 1886, was jettisoned from the German ship Paula, as part of an experiment into ocean and shipping routes by the German Naval Observatory. Previously, the Guinness world record for the oldest message in a bottle was 108 years,external, between it being sent and found. The Illman family were driving through a beach north of Wedge Island on 21 January when the car became bogged down in the sand, and Mrs Illman and her friend decided to go for a walk. ""Tonya saw a whole lot of rubbish on the ground, and thought she'd help pick up some rubbish,"" Mr Illman told the BBC. She found and picked up the bottle, thinking it would be nice for her bookshelf, he added. Mr Illman said his wife passed the bottle ""to our son's girlfriend, who saw what she thought was a rolled-up cigarette, and tipped it out with the sand"". ""Tonya tried to untie the string around the paper, but it was rather fragile, so we took it home and put it in the oven for five minutes to dry up the moisture. ""Then we unrolled it and saw printed writing. We could not see the hand written ink at that point, but saw a printed message that asked the reader to contact the German consulate when they found the note."" Later, they also noticed faint handwriting on the note, with a date of 12 June 1886 and the name of the ship, Paula. When they saw the date they thought it was ""too far-fetched"" to be real, Mr Illman said - but they researched the bottle online and took it to experts at the Western Australian Museum. Kym and Tonya Illman have loaned the find to the Western Australian Museum Dr Ross Anderson, Assistant Curator Maritime Archaeology at the WA Museum,external, confirmed the find was authentic after consulting with colleagues from Germany and the Netherlands. ""Incredibly, an archival search in Germany found Paula's original Meteorological Journal and there was an entry for 12 June 1886 made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard. The date and the coordinates correspond exactly with those on the bottle message,"" Dr Anderson said. The handwriting on the journal, and the message in the bottle, also matched, he added. The bottle was jettisoned in the south-eastern Indian Ocean while the ship was travelling from Cardiff in Wales to Indonesia, and probably washed up on the Australian coast within 12 months, where it was buried under the sand, he wrote in his report.,external Thousands of bottles were thrown overboard during the 69-year German experiment but to date only 662 messages - and no bottles - had been returned. The last bottle with a note to be found was in Denmark in 1934. The bottle found on Wedge Island was found ""mostly exposed without any form of cork or closure, and was about a quarter full of damp sand"", and the bottle appeared to have lain ""buried or mostly buried"", partially filled with damp sand, Dr Anderson added. This video can not be played Over the last two decades, Harold Hackett has sent out over 4,800 messages in a bottle from the Canadian coast. Sand dunes in the area are quite mobile during storm events and heavy rain, so the bottle could have been subject to ""cyclical periods of exposure"" which could have led to the cork in the bottle drying out and becoming dislodged, ""while the tightly rolled paper along with a quantity of sand remained inside preserved"". ""The narrow 7mm bore of the bottle opening and thick glass would have assisted to buffer and preserve the paper from the effects of full exposure to the elements, providing a protective microenvironment favourable to the paper's long-term preservation,"" the report added. Sunken US WW2 warship found under Coral Sea Feline sighting sparks HK 'tiger' scare Last rhino of his kind improves slightly The Illman family have loaned the find to the Western Australian Museum for the next two years, and it will be on display to the public from Wednesday. WA Minister for Culture and the Arts David Templeman said he was ""delighted"" with the loan, adding: ""It is truly an impressive find and thanks to the wonderful international and interdisciplinary cooperation of science and research, it can now also be shared with the world."" Writing online, Mrs Illman described the find as ""the most remarkable event in my life"",external. ""To think that this bottle has not been touched for nearly 132 years and is in perfect condition, despite the elements, beggars belief. I'm still shaking."" Reporting by the BBC's Helier Cheung.

"The pair were escorted from a train in Perth on Monday A 45-year-old man and 17-year-old girl have been arrested after sustaining injuries during an incident in a police vehicle in Perth. Stuart Lymer and the teenager, both from Staffordshire, had been escorted from a train in the city on Monday. The pair - who had previously been reported missing - are being treated in hospital, although their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. The incident is understood to have involved a bladed weapon. Police Scotland has referred the matter to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc). Police in Staffordshire had previously issued an appeal to trace the pair, who are undergoing treatment in Dundee. Assistant Chief Constable John Hawkins said: ""Following an incident yesterday within a police vehicle in Perth, a 45-year-old man and 17-year-old woman have been arrested. ""Both are currently undergoing treatment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee as a result of injuries sustained during the incident at Perth.

"Ms Schiappa told French media the government had decided to set the age of consent at 15 France plans to fix the legal age of sexual consent at 15, meaning sex with someone younger than that would be considered rape. Equality Minister MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa welcomed the move, which follows advice from doctors and legal experts. Currently, prosecutors must prove sex with someone under 15 was forced in order to bring rape charges. The change comes amid uproar over two recent cases of men accused of having sex with 11-year-old girls. Under the existing legislation, if there is no violence or coercion proved,offenders may only be charged with sexual abuse of a minor and not rape,external. This has a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of â¬75,000 (Â£66,000; $87,000). Sentences are the same for sexual assaults of minors and non-minors,external, but rape convictions carry much harsher punishments. One French woman in eight has been raped, study says French plans for anti-street harassment law The government is to approve the new age limit as part of a package of other laws against sexual violence and harassment in the coming weeks. It had been discussing whether to set the age as 13 or 15, which is what groups fighting violence against children had campaigned for. Ms Schiappa told AFP news agency that she was ""very glad"" that the higher age was chosen. The limit is also supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Minister of Solidarity and Health AgnÃ¨s Buzyn saidsetting a legal age of sexual consent would allow a ""collective awareness"",externaland that everyone would see what was ""legal and illegal"", Le Figaro newspaper reports (in French). President Macron has expressed support to setting 15 as the age of consent Last November, a 30-year-old man was acquitted of rape after a court determined his 11-year-old victim had not been subjected to ""constraint, threat, violence or surprise"". In another case, a court initially said a 28-year-old man should face charges of sexual assault, and not rape, after saying the victim was not physically forced to have sex. But the same court reversed its decision last month, saying the accused should indeed face rape charges. Legislation varies across Europe, withcountries setting different legal ages of consent,external: 14 years old: Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal 15: Greece, Poland, Sweden 16: Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Russia 17: Cyprus In the UK the age of sexual consent is 16, but children under the age of 13 have additional legal protections that declare they can never consent to sexual activity.

"Home Office officials have been asked to convince the European Parliament the system for EU citizens in the UK will not become a ""bureaucratic nightmare"". The parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said he had invited the officials to Brussels, after meetings with  David Davis and other ministers. Mr Verhofstadt said he wanted to ensure the rights of UK citizens in the EU as well as EU citizens in the UK. The European Parliament has a veto on any eventual UK-EU Brexit deal. UK can 'set example to world' on Brexit - PM Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan 'Hard facts' for both Brexit sides - May Mr Verhofstadt met Brexit Secretary David Davis in 9 Downing Street, before moving to 10 Downing Street for meetings with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The former Belgian prime minister, who last week called on Mrs May to come up with ""credible proposals"" for Brexit after her Mansion House speech on Friday, was briefed about plans for citizens' rights, and the Northern Ireland border. He said Home Office officials had accepted his invitation to explain how the new application system for settled status would work before the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee. MEPs, he said, needed to be ""100% sure"" that the process would be simple and effective and the future of EU nationals in the UK and their British counterparts on the continent would be secured as soon as possible. On the UK's future relationship with the EU, he warned against a web of agreements and arrangements on issues ranging from aviation to fishing which was not underpinned by some form of basic ""architecture"". ""How many (agreements) are we going to make without some global concept covering all this?"" he said. ""Otherwise we cannot go forwards in these negotiations, certainly not in the second phase, and defining the future relationship."" The MEP suggested the ""best way forward"" for the UK was to stay ""very near"" to the EU's rules and standards, which he said would protect jobs. The European Parliament will finalise its latest draft proposal on the framework of the future relationship between the European Union and the UK on Wednesday, ahead of a vote next week in Strasbourg, where the Parliament meets when it is not in Brussels. Mr Davis told MPs that the UK had among the highest standards in Europe when it came to financial and environmental regulation. Appearing before the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, he said should Parliament take the ""ridiculous decision"" to undercut European standards at some point in the future, it would do so in the knowledge there would be a ""price"" to be paid in terms of market access or tariffs. Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has poured cold water on a suggestion by Theresa May that the customs arrangements on the US-Canada border could provide a model for the Irish border after Brexit. ""I visited it back in August, and I saw a hard border with physical infrastructure with customs posts, people in uniforms with arms and dogs and that is definitely not a solution that is one that we can possibly entertain,"" said Mr Varadkar. Meanwhile, the DUP has stressed its opposition to the EU's ""fallback"" position - which would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the single market if no other solution could be found - in talks in Brussels with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. The United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The World is watching and waiting!"" ""May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vice-President Mike Pence added: ""All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization."" Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea's take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea's apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. ""While the dialogues continue,"" the South says, ""the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations."" (Surely not Pyongyang's words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. These were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had ""somewhat shared"" views on some issues.

"The former chairman of the Co-operative Bank, Paul Flowers, has been banned from the financial services industry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Mr Flowers was chairman of the bank at the time of its near collapse in 2013 when itrevealed a Â£1.5bn black hole in its accounts. The FCA found he had used his work email for sexually explicit messages, and to discuss illegal drugs. He left amid concerns about expenses and in 2014 admitted drug possession. Using the email provided by the Co-op for such communication was in breach of its workplace guidelines and Mr Flowers continued such usage despite having been warned not to previously. He also used his Co-op mobile phone to call premium rate chat lines. The FCA said he had ""demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services"" and consumers would lose faith in the industry if he was allowed to continue in it. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company's culture, values and behaviours. ""Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals."" The FCA said its investigation had taken so long partly because of its need to be thorough, but also because, in this case, it had to wait until other investigations into the collapse of the bank itself and the conduct of other executives were well under way. In 2016, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority banned two former Co-operative Bank executives from holding senior banking positions. It also fined them. The Treasury has now also announced it has launched a new independent review into the way the Co-op Bank was supervised between 2008 and 2013. It said its investigation had had to wait until the FCA's one had ended. Its independent review will look at the ""actions, policies and approach"" of the former City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, and the current one, the Prudential Regulation Authority. In the period under review, the bank changed dramatically. It merged with the Britannia building society in 2009. That deal was later held responsible for the near collapse of the bank. In 2013, it tried and failed to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. Co-op Bank wins Â£700m rescue deal Former Co-op Bank executives banned How did Flowers bloom at Co-op Bank?

"The pair were escorted from a train in Perth on Monday A 45-year-old man and 17-year-old girl have been arrested after sustaining injuries during an incident in a police vehicle in Perth. Stuart Lymer and the teenager, both from Staffordshire, had been escorted from a train in the city on Monday. The pair - who had previously been reported missing - are being treated in hospital, although their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. The incident is understood to have involved a bladed weapon. Police Scotland has referred the matter to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc). Police in Staffordshire had previously issued an appeal to trace the pair, who are undergoing treatment in Dundee. Assistant Chief Constable John Hawkins said: ""Following an incident yesterday within a police vehicle in Perth, a 45-year-old man and 17-year-old woman have been arrested. ""Both are currently undergoing treatment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee as a result of injuries sustained during the incident at Perth. ""They are expected to appear at court from custody over the coming days, after being released from the hospital."" A spokesman for the PIRC said: ""We can confirm that we have received a referral from Police Scotland in relation to the serious injury of a 17-year-old woman and 45-year-old man who were being transferred in a police vehicle to Perth Police Office on 5 March, 2018.

"The USS Lexington was scuttled during the Battle of the Coral Sea The wreck of a US aircraft carrier that was sunk during World War Two has been found off the coast of Australia. The USS Lexington was found 3km (2 miles) underwater in the Coral Sea, about 800km off Australia's east coast. The ship was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, fought with Japan from 4-8 May 1942. More than 200 crew members died in the fighting. The US Navy confirmed the ship had been discovered by a search team led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Pictures showed the wreck to be well preserved. The discovery of the Lexington, along with 11 of its 35 aircraft, was made by Mr Allen's company Vulcan on Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

Adm Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, praised the discovery. ""As the son of a survivor of the USS Lexington, I offer my congratulations to Paul Allen and the expedition crew of Research Vessel (R/V) Petrel for locating the 'Lady Lex',"" he said on Tuesday. The ship was sunk along with 35 aircraft on board The Battle of the Coral Sea is considered a key moment in halting Japan's advance in the Pacific during the war. The Lexington was scuttled by US forces after being struck by several Japanese torpedoes and bombs during the battle. The US Navy said 216 crew members died after the ship was attacked. More than 2,000 others were rescued. One of Lexington's anti-aircraft guns ""Lexington was on our priority list because she was one of the capital ships that was lost during WWII,"" Vulcan spokesman Robert Kraft said. Pictures from the seabed taken by the Petrel show the Lexington's nameplate and guns. Some of the ship's aircraft are also shown in remarkably good condition. The ship will not be retrieved because the US Navy considers it to be a war grave. Mr Kraft said it had taken about six months of planning to locate the ship. Last year,Vulcan discovered the wreck of the USS Indianapolis, which sank in July 1945. It has found other vessels including a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the same era.

"Myanmar has not stopped its ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state, a United Nations human rights official said on Tuesday. The UN envoy's assessment of a continued ""campaign of terror and forced starvation"" comes six months after a military crackdown caused a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims. Some 700,000 people have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since August. They have since told of murder, rape and arson by soldiers and vigilantes. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians in Rakhine state. What you need to know about the crisis Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? Bangladesh 'to return 300 Rohingya a day' Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? ""The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Myanmar continues,"" said the UN's assistant secretary-general for human rights, Andrew Gilmour. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts ""I don't think we can draw any other conclusion from what I have seen and heard in Cox's Bazar,"" he added, referring to a district in southern Bangladesh which is home to most of the refugees. ""The nature of the violence has changed from the frenzied blood-letting and mass rape of last year to a lower intensity campaign of terror and forced starvation,"" Mr Gilmour said after speaking with recently arrived Rohingya in packed refugee camps, according to AFP. Bangladesh and Myanmar authorities had been in talks over repatriating refugees in the coming months buta build up of Myanmar military on the border last week sparked concern. The UN envoy said it was ""inconceivable"" for any Rohingya to return to Rakhine state in the near future in a ""safe, dignified and sustainable"" way. ""The government of Myanmar is busy telling the world that it is ready to receive Rohingya returnees, while at the same time its forces are continuing to drive them into Bangladesh,"" Mr Gilmour said. This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage from the DEC shows the extent of sprawling camps on the Bangladesh border By Anbarasan Ethirajan, Balukhali refugee camp, near Cox's Bazar In the months since they arrived, most of the 700,000 Rohingya refugees now appear to be in camps with a roof over their heads and food provided by aid agencies. They are no longer living on roadsides or in the jungle. But a walk through Balukhali, one of the largest refugee camps in the world, is a staggering and intense experience. More than 300,000 men, women and children are cramped in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheeting. There are rivulets of sewage running through the camps. Most of the shacks are sitting precariously on hill terraces. I could see dozens of men, women and even children carrying their weekly food rations. The refugees may feel safer, but the real challenge will start once the monsoon begins in a couple of months.

"Danish toymaker Lego has reported its first sales decline in 13 years Too many Lego bricks is a problem many parents will sympathise with, but now the toy firm itself has admitted it has made too many. The company said sales and profits had fallen for the first time in 13 years, blaming the weak performance on having to sell off excess stock cheaply. A Lego spokeswoman said it had ""too much"" stock in warehouses and shops. ""There wasn't enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness,"" she added. The Danish toymaker said dealing with the stock issue, as well as a drop in sales in Europe and North America, had dragged down its performance last year.

Revenue for 2017 dropped by 8% to 35bn Danish kroner (Â£4.2bn; $5.8bn), compared to 37.9bn kroner in 2016. Pre-tax profits slid 18% to 10.4bn kroner in 2017. ""During the year, revenues declined, however consumer sales - or sales in stores - remained flat. This shows that consumers (kids and their parents) are continuing to buy from retailers,"" said Lego's spokeswoman.

However, he said the firm's performance had improved towards the end of the year, with sales growing in seven of its 12 largest markets in December. The company has been increasing sales in new markets, particularly in Asia. Lego said that it saw ""strong potential"" in its business in China, where sales enjoyed double digit growth last year. ""However, to reduce retail inventories, we shipped less to our retailers than what the consumers are buying."" Lego opened its first Asian factory in China in 2016 ""We started 2018 in better shape and during the coming year we will stabilise the business by continuing to invest in great products, effective global marketing and improved execution,"" said Mr Christiansen. In September, Lego said its half-year results had suffered because it had stretched itself too thin by diversifying into products that were not toys, such as the Lego movies. Lego chairman Jorgen Knudstorp said at the time that adding complexity to the company had made it harder for the toymaker to grow further. He said that the firm had pressed ""the reset button"" for the group with the aim of building ""a smaller and less complex organisation"".

"The University of London is to announce a fully fledged undergraduate degree course completely taught online for Â£5,650 per year over three years. It is aimed at encouraging more part-time, working students, following a fall in their numbers after the increase in tuition fees in England. There are plans for 3,000 students to take the computer science course. It comes as the prime minister's review of tuition fees aims to encourage more flexible and cheaper ways to study. The review follows concerns about the high cost of university, with average graduate debts of more than Â£50,000. The University of London claims to have been the first university in the world to offer distance learning - with correspondence courses in the 1850s. But it is announcing its first online BSc course, to run from next year, with the content produced by academics at Goldsmiths, University of London. This will be the University of London's first online BSc degree The university's deputy chief executive, Craig O'Callaghan, says it expects to attract ""people who are working and need a more flexible approach"". Part-time student numbers fell by more than 40% after fees increased in 2012 - and the current review of university funding has to find ways to reverse this trend. There have been other online undergraduate degree courses - such as those pioneered by the Open University. But the University of London says its entry into this market is the beginning of a ""step change"" in its approach to using online courses to reach more undergraduate students. The course is being produced in a partnership with one of the world's biggest online university companies, the California-based Coursera. The computing course content will be from academics at Goldsmiths This US company, which has 31 million registered students, has developed many free online courses - known as massive open online courses (Moocs) - but these are not accredited degrees. The deal with the University of London will be Coursera's first fully fledged BSc degree. It will have group work, live video and individual tuition, all delivered online. But students will go to exam centres for final, invigilated exams. Jeff Maggioncalda, the chief executive of Coursera, said the new course would be a ""game changer"" for a ""different type of student"". Adults might want to get a degree, but ""they're not going to quit their jobs to go back to class"",  he says. An online degree will let them stay in work and not have the extra cost of university accommodation, says Mr Maggioncalda. ""So expect a lot of students who are older and working."" The course will begin with a few hundred students, but it is intended to be scaled up to having about 3,000 students - much bigger than a conventionally taught degree course. This ""totally changes the equation"" in terms of the finances of delivering university degrees, says Mr Maggioncalda. ""It's so compelling that other universities will have to follow,"" he says. Postgraduate courses have become more frequently available online - and Coursera will be announcing a number of other partnerships, including a postgraduate public health degree from Imperial College, London. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says that so far technology has not made the impact once predicted for higher education. Younger students have continued to sign up for traditional courses, regardless of the price, he says. But there is ""definitely scope for new initiatives that do things differently"" and the success of online degrees will depend on being able to ""tap deeply into the market for non-traditional students, like mature learners"".

"The DUP delegation met Michel Barnier in Brussels on Tuesday morning The Democratic Unionist Party has told the EU's chief Brexit negotiator that Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK. DUP leader Arlene Foster, her deputy Nigel Dodds, MEP Diane Dodds and East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson met Michel Barnier in Brussels. The party told him the EU must show greater flexibility in Brexit talks. Mrs Foster said it was a ""constructive meeting"" and that Mr Barnier had ""listened to our point of view"". UK can 'set example to world' on Brexit - PM Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan Brexit: All you need to know The DUP, the UK and Irish governments and the EU have all said they want to avoid a ""hard border"" with physical checkpoints on the island of Ireland. The delegation discussed adraft legal text published by the EU last week,external, which proposed a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs Foster said the draft legal text went beyond thejoint report agreed by the UK and the EU during a breakthrough in the talks in December. She said the text had omissions in some areas and overreached in others. Mr Barnier had been ""receptive to that tone"", said Mrs Foster, and she urged the UK government to come forward with alternative text for the controversial protocol on Ireland. The DUP told the EU negotiator that greater flexibility must be shown by Brussels The DUP leader repeated acomment made by Theresa May last week, saying that ""no British Prime Minister could ever accept the draft legal text"". ""It is important that the text accurately and fully reflects December's joint report,"" Mrs Foster said. ""The fundamental problem as it currently stands is that it challenges the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" The DUP leader also warned Mr Barnier that a 'no deal' scenario would be ""more damaging for the Republic of Ireland than for any other EU country"". Mr Wilson said the Irish government was playing Russian roulette because of the risk to their economy if a deal was not reached. However, Mrs Foster said ""sensible solutions"" to the post-Brexit Irish border were possible and pointed out: ""There already is a border with different VAT rates, fuel duties, currencies and animal health policies."" ""Solutions for the Irish border can be found.  Importantly though, we need to establish the overall relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the UK exits the EU. It is vital the discussions on trade get underway."" ""We will work with Her Majesty's government and the EU27 in delivering a sensible Brexit that everyone wants to see. Today's meeting was a useful part of that process."" Mrs Foster said there were 'sensible solutions' to the border question Their meeting came afterSinn FÃ©in held talks with Mr Barnier on Monday. Mr Barnier met Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, vice president Michelle O'Neill and MEPs Martina Anderson and Matt Carthy. Ms McDonald said the discussions were a ""meeting of minds"" and the issue of Brexit was now in ""Mrs May's court"". She said the British government had to come up with ""Plan A and Plan B"". The Sinn FÃ©in leader added that there could be no overall agreement on Brexit unless the issue of the Irish border was solved. She said her party was ""not looking for a border down the Irish Sea"".

"There has been a significant drop in the number of child marriages worldwide, the United Nations children's agency says. Unicef estimates that 25 million child marriages have been prevented in the past decade,external. One in five girls are now married before they are 18, compared with one in four a decade ago. South Asian countries have seen the biggest reduction in child marriages, Unicef says. In India this was achieved by better education for girls and by publicising the harm child marriage causes. The agency said the problem was now most severe in Africa but even so, Ethiopia had cut child marriage rates by a third. India Supreme Court rules sex with child bride is rape Is a child bride really married every seven seconds? Indian teenager's plea to annul her child marriage Anju Malhotra, Unicef's principal gender adviser, said that given the life-changing impact child marriage had on a girl's life, ""any reduction is welcome news - but we've got a long way to go"". ""When a girl is forced to marry as a child she faces immediate and lifelong consequences,"" she said. ""Her odds of finishing school decrease while her odds of being abused by her husband and suffering complications during pregnancy increase. There are also huge societal consequences, and higher risk of intergenerational cycles of poverty."" Helping girls to study rather than become child brides What is it like to be a child bride? The report said that the burden of child marriage was shifting to sub-Saharan Africa, where more progress was needed to offset population growth. Unicef said nearly one in three child marriages were now in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with one in five a decade ago. World leaders have vowed to end child marriage by 2030 under the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

"The former chairman of the Co-operative Bank, Paul Flowers, has been banned from the financial services industry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Mr Flowers was chairman of the bank at the time of its near collapse in 2013 when itrevealed a Â£1.5bn black hole in its accounts. The FCA found he had used his work email for sexually explicit messages, and to discuss illegal drugs. He left amid concerns about expenses and in 2014 admitted drug possession. Using the email provided by the Co-op for such communication was in breach of its workplace guidelines and Mr Flowers continued such usage despite having been warned not to previously. He also used his Co-op mobile phone to call premium rate chat lines. The FCA said he had ""demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services"" and consumers would lose faith in the industry if he was allowed to continue in it. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company's culture, values and behaviours. ""Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals."" The FCA said its investigation had taken so long partly because of its need to be thorough, but also because, in this case, it had to wait until other investigations into the collapse of the bank itself and the conduct of other executives were well under way. In 2016, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority banned two former Co-operative Bank executives from holding senior banking positions. It also fined them. The Treasury has now also announced it has launched a new independent review into the way the Co-op Bank was supervised between 2008 and 2013. It said its investigation had had to wait until the FCA's one had ended. Its independent review will look at the ""actions, policies and approach"" of the former City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, and the current one, the Prudential Regulation Authority. In the period under review, the bank changed dramatically. It merged with the Britannia building society in 2009. That deal was later held responsible for the near collapse of the bank. In 2013, it tried and failed to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. Co-op Bank wins Â£700m rescue deal Former Co-op Bank executives banned How did Flowers bloom at Co-op Bank?

"The University of London is to announce a fully fledged undergraduate degree course completely taught online for Â£5,650 per year over three years. It is aimed at encouraging more part-time, working students, following a fall in their numbers after the increase in tuition fees in England. There are plans for 3,000 students to take the computer science course. It comes as the prime minister's review of tuition fees aims to encourage more flexible and cheaper ways to study. The review follows concerns about the high cost of university, with average graduate debts of more than Â£50,000. The University of London claims to have been the first university in the world to offer distance learning - with correspondence courses in the 1850s. But it is announcing its first online BSc course, to run from next year, with the content produced by academics at Goldsmiths, University of London. This will be the University of London's first online BSc degree The university's deputy chief executive, Craig O'Callaghan, says it expects to attract ""people who are working and need a more flexible approach"". Part-time student numbers fell by more than 40% after fees increased in 2012 - and the current review of university funding has to find ways to reverse this trend. There have been other online undergraduate degree courses - such as those pioneered by the Open University. But the University of London says its entry into this market is the beginning of a ""step change"" in its approach to using online courses to reach more undergraduate students. The course is being produced in a partnership with one of the world's biggest online university companies, the California-based Coursera. The computing course content will be from academics at Goldsmiths This US company, which has 31 million registered students, has developed many free online courses - known as massive open online courses (Moocs) - but these are not accredited degrees. The deal with the University of London will be Coursera's first fully fledged BSc degree. It will have group work, live video and individual tuition, all delivered online. But students will go to exam centres for final, invigilated exams. Jeff Maggioncalda, the chief executive of Coursera, said the new course would be a ""game changer"" for a ""different type of student"". Adults might want to get a degree, but ""they're not going to quit their jobs to go back to class"",  he says. An online degree will let them stay in work and not have the extra cost of university accommodation, says Mr Maggioncalda. ""So expect a lot of students who are older and working."" The course will begin with a few hundred students, but it is intended to be scaled up to having about 3,000 students - much bigger than a conventionally taught degree course. This ""totally changes the equation"" in terms of the finances of delivering university degrees, says Mr Maggioncalda. ""It's so compelling that other universities will have to follow,"" he says. Postgraduate courses have become more frequently available online - and Coursera will be announcing a number of other partnerships, including a postgraduate public health degree from Imperial College, London. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says that so far technology has not made the impact once predicted for higher education. Younger students have continued to sign up for traditional courses, regardless of the price, he says. But there is ""definitely scope for new initiatives that do things differently"" and the success of online degrees will depend on being able to ""tap deeply into the market for non-traditional students, like mature learners"".

"The DUP delegation met Michel Barnier in Brussels on Tuesday morning The Democratic Unionist Party has told the EU's chief Brexit negotiator that Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK. DUP leader Arlene Foster, her deputy Nigel Dodds, MEP Diane Dodds and East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson met Michel Barnier in Brussels. The party told him the EU must show greater flexibility in Brexit talks. Mrs Foster said it was a ""constructive meeting"" and that Mr Barnier had ""listened to our point of view"". UK can 'set example to world' on Brexit - PM Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan Brexit: All you need to know The DUP, the UK and Irish governments and the EU have all said they want to avoid a ""hard border"" with physical checkpoints on the island of Ireland. The delegation discussed adraft legal text published by the EU last week,external, which proposed a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs Foster said the draft legal text went beyond thejoint report agreed by the UK and the EU during a breakthrough in the talks in December. She said the text had omissions in some areas and overreached in others. Mr Barnier had been ""receptive to that tone"", said Mrs Foster, and she urged the UK government to come forward with alternative text for the controversial protocol on Ireland. The DUP told the EU negotiator that greater flexibility must be shown by Brussels The DUP leader repeated acomment made by Theresa May last week, saying that ""no British Prime Minister could ever accept the draft legal text"". ""It is important that the text accurately and fully reflects December's joint report,"" Mrs Foster said. ""The fundamental problem as it currently stands is that it challenges the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" The DUP leader also warned Mr Barnier that a 'no deal' scenario would be ""more damaging for the Republic of Ireland than for any other EU country"". Mr Wilson said the Irish government was playing Russian roulette because of the risk to their economy if a deal was not reached. However, Mrs Foster said ""sensible solutions"" to the post-Brexit Irish border were possible and pointed out: ""There already is a border with different VAT rates, fuel duties, currencies and animal health policies."" ""Solutions for the Irish border can be found.  Importantly though, we need to establish the overall relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the UK exits the EU. It is vital the discussions on trade get underway."" ""We will work with Her Majesty's government and the EU27 in delivering a sensible Brexit that everyone wants to see. Today's meeting was a useful part of that process."" Mrs Foster said there were 'sensible solutions' to the border question Their meeting came afterSinn FÃ©in held talks with Mr Barnier on Monday. Mr Barnier met Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, vice president Michelle O'Neill and MEPs Martina Anderson and Matt Carthy. Ms McDonald said the discussions were a ""meeting of minds"" and the issue of Brexit was now in ""Mrs May's court"". She said the British government had to come up with ""Plan A and Plan B"". The Sinn FÃ©in leader added that there could be no overall agreement on Brexit unless the issue of the Irish border was solved. She said her party was ""not looking for a border down the Irish Sea"".

"The USS Lexington was scuttled during the Battle of the Coral Sea The wreck of a US aircraft carrier that was sunk during World War Two has been found off the coast of Australia. The USS Lexington was found 3km (2 miles) underwater in the Coral Sea, about 800km off Australia's east coast. The ship was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea, fought with Japan from 4-8 May 1942. More than 200 crew members died in the fighting. The US Navy confirmed the ship had been discovered by a search team led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Pictures showed the wreck to be well preserved. The discovery of the Lexington, along with 11 of its 35 aircraft, was made by Mr Allen's company Vulcan on Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

Adm Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, praised the discovery. ""As the son of a survivor of the USS Lexington, I offer my congratulations to Paul Allen and the expedition crew of Research Vessel (R/V) Petrel for locating the 'Lady Lex',"" he said on Tuesday. The ship was sunk along with 35 aircraft on board The Battle of the Coral Sea is considered a key moment in halting Japan's advance in the Pacific during the war. The Lexington was scuttled by US forces after being struck by several Japanese torpedoes and bombs during the battle. The US Navy said 216 crew members died after the ship was attacked. More than 2,000 others were rescued. One of Lexington's anti-aircraft guns ""Lexington was on our priority list because she was one of the capital ships that was lost during WWII,"" Vulcan spokesman Robert Kraft said. Pictures from the seabed taken by the Petrel show the Lexington's nameplate and guns. Some of the ship's aircraft are also shown in remarkably good condition. The ship will not be retrieved because the US Navy considers it to be a war grave. Mr Kraft said it had taken about six months of planning to locate the ship. Last year,Vulcan discovered the wreck of the USS Indianapolis, which sank in July 1945. It has found other vessels including a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the same era.

"Measures to clamp down on violence and the smuggling of drugs, phones and weapons in prisons have been unveiled by Justice Secretary David Gauke. A unit to tackle serious and organised crime in jails in England and Wales is also being set up. A review of where prisoners are held could see those inmates who pose a risk of committing crime behind bars moved to higher-security jails. The National Crime Agency says one in 13 inmates have organised crime links. It estimates some of these 6,500 offenders continue to be involved in criminality behind bars, including controlling the supply of banned items like phones, and illegal items like drugs and weapons, which are blamed for fuelling instability. 'More' prisoners to be freed with tags Drone smugglers caught on camera Jail drug trade linked to organised crime In his first major speech since being appointed justice secretary in January, Mr Gauke said new technologies had empowered gangs to be more ""sophisticated and brazen"". He said Spice and other drugs could be ""ordered with a 'Deliveroo-style' responsiveness on tiny mobile phones from prison cells and delivered by drones direct to cell windows"". Gangs engineered situations where released prisoners deliberately breached their licence conditions so they were sent back to smuggle in more drugs, he said. Mr Gauke said he was ""shocked and sickened"" by videos posted on social media which showed the ""terrifying"" impact of Spice on prisoners and he said the drug had been linked to attacks on prison staff. To help prevent contraband going into prisons, technology that allows officers to instantly download data from mobile phones seized from prisoners - meaning the phones do not have to be sent away to be processed - will be installed at 30 jails. David Gauke used his first major speech to unveil measures to clamp down on violence and the smuggling of drugs, phones and weapons in prisons Mr Gauke also announced an overhaul of the prisoners' incentives and privileges scheme to encourage inmates to ""play by the rules"". Prisoners would get extra family contact via Skype and could be released temporarily, if they behaved well behind bars, he said. ""I know that incentives work and I want to put them to work in prisons,"" said Mr Gauke. He added that it was his ""aspiration"" to cut the prison population, but said there would be no ""artificial target"". Mr Gauke also promised to ""remove the influence"" of gangs so prisons can become ""places of hope not despair"". Under current rules, inmates can be moved during their sentence if their categorisation changes. A proposal being examined by the government would see the risk of continuing criminality in prison taken into account. Offenders who pose a risk of crime in jail could be moved to prisons with more restrictive regimes. Many of these prisoners are currently held in lower-security prisons because they are serving short sentences and are not assessed as likely to escape. Mr Gauke said: ""We are taking action to bolster our defences at the prison gate and going after the organised criminal gangs. ""I want them to know that as a result of the action we are taking, they have no place to hide."" But Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon criticised Mr Gauke's speech and said the Conservatives had ""nothing to offer"" to address the prison crisis. ""Tory cuts to staff and budgets have created the dire situation in our prisons,"" he said. ""With even greater budget cuts planned over the coming years, there is a real danger that our prisons will move beyond crisis to a full-blown emergency.""

"Sam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year A US lawmaker investigating alleged Russian election meddling says an ex-Trump aide should testify on wild claims he has made about the president. Mr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware of a 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian lawyer, and may have ""done something"" during the campaign. Democrat Adam Schiff responded by saying his congressional panel ""needs to explore"" Mr Nunberg's allegation. Mr Nunberg is the latest figure to become embroiled in the Russia inquiry. ""Certainly if Mr Nunberg has light to shed about what the president knew about the Trump Tower meeting, we would like to find out,"" Mr Schiff said, referring to his House Intelligence Committee's investigation on Monday night. US President Donald Trump has denied any knowledge of that meeting, which has become a central focus of a separate inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Congressman Mike Conway, who serves as leading chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed the idea of calling Mr Nunberg to testify, saying of the Trump Tower meeting: ""I think we've pretty much explored that to death."" All you need to know about Trump Russia story What does the special counsel do? The tactics of a Russian troll farm Mr Nunberg told the New York Daily News on Tuesday he is contemplating seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, a day after his extraordinary series of interviews on live television. He complained to US media on Monday about being asked to share his email conversations with a long list of ex-campaign aides in response to a subpoena from Mr Mueller's team. The political operative, who helped launch Donald Trump's presidential campaign before losing his job in 2015, said in a round of media interviews at first he would not comply with Mr Mueller's demand to testify before a grand jury. But he later told the Associated Press he would probably end up complying. ""I think it would be really, really funny if they wanted to arrest me because I don't want to spend 80 hours going over emails,"" he told MSNBC. While he thought investigators believed they had something on Mr Trump, he argued that the subpoena was unfair and added he would like Robert Mueller's team to narrow its scope of inquiry. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the investigation that hangs over the Trump presidency White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders would not be drawn on Mr Nunberg's remarks, saying: ""I'm not going to weigh in on somebody that doesn't work at the White House."" Sam Nunberg worked on the Trump campaign in 2015 until he was fired in August that year over racially charged Facebook posts. He was later sued by Mr Trump for $10m (Â£7.2m) for breach of confidentiality. The lawsuit was ""amicably settled"" out of court, a lawyer for the Trump Organization said at the time. Mr Nunberg said Mr Trump was aware at the time of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when a group of Russians offered his campaign staff damaging information about Hillary Clinton. ""You know he knew about it,"" Mr Nunberg told CNN. ""He was talking about it a week before. I don't know why he went around trying to hide it."" The White House has repeatedly denied Mr Trump knew anything about that meeting. During Monday's interviews with US media, Mr Nunberg said he had met Mr Mueller's team for five-and-a-half hours over the weekend. He said he would not appear before a grand jury to testify on Friday. ""I'm not co-operating. Arrest me,"" Mr Nunberg said on live television. ""You want to arrest me? Arrest me."" At times during the interviews, Mr Nunberg appeared to contradict himself. He said: ""Trump may very well have done something during the election with the Russians. If he did that, I don't know."" But Mr Nunberg also told CNN's Jake Tapper: ""It's the biggest joke to ever think Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.""

"This video can not be played Russian spy attack: What we know so far A man who is critically ill after being exposed to an unknown substance in Wiltshire is a Russian national convicted of spying for Britain, the BBC understands. Sergei Skripal, 66, was granted refuge in the UK following a ""spy swap"" between the US and Russia in 2010. He and a woman, 33,were found unconscious on a bench at a shopping centrein Salisbury on Sunday. Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury has been closed by police ""as a precaution"". The substance has not been identified, but Public Health England said there was no known risk to the public's health. Wiltshire Police are investigating whether a crime has been committed. They said the pairhad no visible injuries,externalbut had been found unconscious at the Maltings shopping centre. They have declared a ""major incident"" and multiple agencies are investigating. They said it had not been declared as a counter-terrorism incident, but they were keeping an ""open mind"". Col Skripal, who is a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006 for spying for Britain. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Russia said Col Skripal had been paid $100,000 for the information, which he had been supplying from the 1990s. He was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 US spies in 2010, as part of a swap. Col Skripal was later flown to the UK. He and the woman, who police said were known to each other, are both in intensive care at Salisbury District Hospital. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" A number of locations in the city centre were cordoned off and teams in full protective gear used hoses to decontaminate the street. The hospital advised people to attend routine operations and outpatient appointments unless they were contacted. It said its A&E department was open but busy because of the weather. Populists vie for power after Italy vote The killer disease with no vaccine Big thaw leaves thousands without water On the restaurant closure, police said Public Health England had reiterated the advice that there was no known risk to the wider public, but as a precaution advised that if people felt ill they should contact the NHS on 111. ""If you feel your own or another's health is significantly deteriorating, ring 999,"" police said. Neighbours at Sergei Skripal's home in Salisbury say police arrived around 17:00 GMT on Sunday and have been there ever since. They said he was friendly and in recent years had lost his wife. This video can not be played Temp Asst Chief Constable Craig Holden: ""We are unable to ascertain whether or not a crime has taken place"" Eyewitness Freya Church told the BBC it looked like the two people had taken ""something quite strong"". She said: ""On the bench there was a couple, an older guy and a younger girl. She was sort of leant in on him, it looked like she had passed out maybe. ""He was doing some strange hand movements, looking up to the sky... ""They looked so out of it I thought even if I did step in I wasn't sure how I could help."" Public Health England has not confirmed what the substance was The hospital's A&E was closed on Monday while two people were treated The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident died in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in the UK, when asked for comment on the incident, said: ""Neither relatives nor legal representatives of the said person, nor the British authorities, have addressed the embassy in this regard."" By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The parallels are striking with the 2006 case of Alexander Litvinenko. He, too, was a former Russian intelligence officer who had come to the UK and was taken ill for reasons that were initially unclear. In that case, it took weeks to establish that the cause was deliberate poisoning, and it took close to a decade before a public inquiry pointed the finger of blame at the Russian state. Officials are stressing that it is too early this time to speculate on what happened here or why. The police are not even yet saying a crime has been committed, but if the similarities do firm up and Moscow is once again found to be in the frame there will be questions about what kind of response might be required - and whether enough was done in the past to deter such activity being repeated. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the police approach to the Salisbury incident suggested there could be a ""very sinister background"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, he said: ""It could indeed potentially have been the FSB (Russian intelligence services) or the Kremlin could have been behind it. ""It could have been some form of criminal response for other reasons, or it could be some form of personal grievance some individual had against these two people or either of them. ""We don't know at this stage and it is not going to be useful to speculate beyond that,"" he added. Col Skripal was convicted of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court in August 2006. He was stripped off all his titles and awards. He was alleged by the Russian security service FSB to have begun working for the British secret services while serving in the army in the 1990s. He had been passing information classified as state secrets and been paid for the work by MI6, the FSB claimed. Col Skripal pleaded guilty at his trial and co-operated with investigators, reports said at the time. Were you in the area at the time? Have you been affected by the incident?

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. The United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The World is watching and waiting!"" ""May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vice-President Mike Pence added: ""All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization."" Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea's take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea's apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. ""While the dialogues continue,"" the South says, ""the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations."" (Surely not Pyongyang's words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. These were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had ""somewhat shared"" views on some issues.

"The shop and flat above were both destroyed in the blast An explosion that killed five people in Leicester was caused by petrol being spread through a shop, a court has heard. A Polish supermarket and the flat above in Hinckley Road were destroyed in the blast on the evening of 25 February. Three men have appeared in court for the first time charged with arson and manslaughter over the explosion. The store's owner Aram Kurd, 33, is charged along with Hawkar Hassan, 32, and Arkan Ali, 37. Prosecuting solicitor Zoe Lee told Leicester Magistrates' Court: ""It has been established that the explosion was caused by petrol and the petrol was spread throughout the shop."" The men were all remanded in custody and will appear at Leicester Crown Court on 3 April via video link. Store owner Aram Kurd is among the three men charged with arson and manslaughter Mary Ragoobar lived in a flat above the shop with her sons Sean and Shane The defendants are: Aram Kurd, 33, of Hillary Place, Leicester Hawkar Hassan, 32, of no fixed address Arkan Ali, 37, of Drake Close, Oldham They each face five counts of manslaughter and one count of arson with intent or being reckless as to whether life was endangered. The court heard that Mr Ali's partner was 22-year-old shop worker Viktorija Ijevleva, who died in the explosion. The explosion killed shop worker Viktorija Ijevleva, who was the partner of one of the men accused of arson and manslaughter A married couple and their three sons lived in the two-storey flat above the shop. Two of the sons - Shane Ragoobeer, 18, and Sean Ragoobeer, 17 - have been named as among the dead. Their mother Mary Ragoobar, 46, is also thought to have died but has not been formally identified.

"Forget leading actor and actress, here are some alternative award categories from Sunday evening's ceremony that deserve an honourable mention. Nothing to see here...Just Jimmy Kimmel and a giant Oscar. The opening monologue is always the biggest part of the Oscar host's job, as it has to spin several plates: be funny, but not gratuitously offensive; address politics, but not alienate a mass audience. It's tricky enough in an easy year - in 2013, Seth McFarlane's We Saw Your Boobs song went down like a Â£3.99 Londis Merlot and has aged just about as well - but this year host Jimmy Kimmel had a monster challenge, with the #MeToo movement dominating Hollywood, several stars with allegations hanging over their heads, and also the matter of the Moonlight / La La Land mistake that marred last year's event. Kimmel tackled them head-on - ""this year, when you hear your name called, don't get up right away"" - and he mentioned Weinstein by name. There was no joke, just a straight, ""we can't let bad behaviour slide anymore. the world is watching us, we need to set an example."" Frances McDormand expanded our vocabularies with ""inclusion rider"". After a barnstorming few minutes on stage after accepting her long-predicted best actress Oscar, Frances McDormand left with two words: ""Inclusion rider"". Many covering the event thought she had said ""inclusion writer"", but actually she was referring to a proposal circulating that, where appropriate, actors include a clause in their contract that their films feature a cast that broadly represents the actual social make-up of their society. Google even retweeted a graphic showing the surge in interest in the term, which can't only have come from journalists writing pieces like this. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Moreover, McDormand's speech is likely to be remembered as the highlight of the whole evening. She began by saying she was ""hyperventilating,"" but added that if she fell down, ""pick me up because I have things to say."" And say them she did - asking every woman in the audience who had been nominated to stand up. What was very clever was that she left it ambiguous as to what point she was making. While obviously it celebrated the achievements of those who stood, many were captured on camera looking around at the empty air around them when, if society in general were reflected,  a larger proportion of the room should have been on its feet. So what actually is an inclusion rider? Why is everyone talking about this outfit? 'I stopped writing this movie 20 times' - Get Out director, Jordan Peele Kimmel ultimately wrapped up by suggesting McDormand should win an Emmy for her moment - and it wouldn't be a bad call. Emma Stone's best director monologue went down....not very well. Though it had been touted beforehand that #MeToo would have its own section and that Kimmel would not directly reference it, nevertheless some pointed references to it still crept through. Not all of them worked, though. There was subdued laughter when Dame Helen Mirren remarked that an ""older man and a younger woman"" was an unusual coupling in Hollywood, while presenting the best actor nominees. But when introducing best director, Emma Stone spoke about ""the four men and Greta Gerwig"" who were nominated. Doing so, pointed to the gender imbalance, but many watching felt it also discredited the achievements of Guillermo del Toro and Jordan Peele as people of colour. Gary Oldman gave an emotional acceptance speech for leading actor. There were not that many sobs on the Oscar stage this year, but a great many would have been shed on the sofas of a bleary-eyed British public as best actor Gary Oldman thanked Winston Churchill and then his mum - ""99-years-young next year."" ""Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I'm bringing Oscar home,"" he added. Bless him. Producer David Fialkow, director Dan Cogan, producer James R. Swartz, and director Bryan Fogel accept best documentary feature. Staying in the UK, many noted that Icarus - a film about doping in cycling - won best documentary within two hours of a report being published by the DCMS into drug use in British cycling. That DCMS report concluded that ""drugs were being used by Team Sky, within World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) rules, to enhance the performance of riders, and not just to treat medical need."" The film's directors declared: ""We hope Icarus is a wake-up call, yes about Russia but more than that about the importance of telling the truth"". Icarus' win prompted probably the best off-the-cuff line from Kimmel of the evening: ""Well, at least we know Putin didn't rig this election."" Kobe Bryant wins for best animated short. Who is the only person to win MVP in basketball's NBA and an Oscar? It's not Michael Jordan for his turn in Space Jam, or (sadly) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for his role as the co-pilot in Airplane (robbed by Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People, Abdul-Jabbar wasn't even nominated. Outrageous). No, it's Kobe Bryant, one half of the team that made the best animated short, Dear Basketball. And, unlike the one about Al Gore - who didn't actually win the Oscar himself, this bit of trivia is true. As an aside, a special mention to the person who remotely operates the mic stand, which glided perfectly up the extra two feet to meet Bryant's lips as he took over. Guillermo del Toro is one of a number of successful Mexican film directors. Speaking of trivia, a fact many have picked up on is that four of the last five best director winners have been Mexican - Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (twice) and now Guillermo del Toro for The Shape Of Water. The Shape Of Water - a film about ""the year men screwed up so badly, women started dating fish,"" as Kimmel put it - is also by some measures the first science fiction film ever to win best film, something sure to be remembered in the same way that The Silence Of The Lambs was the first horror to take that prize. Not only that, but Coco's Remember Me - which won best song - was probably the best of the night's musical performances, all of which were fantastically staged and, as opposed to when they're often rather dull, real stand-out moments of the show. The glittering, multi-coloured skulls of the backdrop will live long in the memory. Aptly. What a beautiful jet ski you've got there Mark Bridges... Here's an incentive to keep those notoriously long Oscar speeches trim - shortest speech won a jet ski worth $17,999, demonstrated by Helen Mirren (who was not included). ""Why waste precious time thanking your mum, when you could take her for the ride of her life?"", Kimmel asked. It looked like Best Supporting Actress Alison Janney would take it when she arrived at the podium and said, ""I did it all myself"" - getting the biggest laugh of the night - but then blew it by actually thanking a load of people after all. So going home on the water tonight - and modelling a lifejacket at the end - was costume designer Mark Bridges. Incidentally, you'll notice we haven't mentioned the bit when Kimmel, Gal Gadot, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Mark Hamill and others went over the road to patronise an audience to death with hot dog guns.

"One gown is never enough at the Academy Awards, especially for those stars who followed the ceremony with a visit to Vanity Fair's post-awards shindig. Here are the contrasting looks chosen by seven A-listers on Sunday - plus one who managed to find three dresses for the occasion. Shape of Water and McDormand rule Oscars Four key themes from this year's Oscars Why's everyone talking about this outfit? Oscars 2018 pictures: Red carpet glamour Britain'sEmily Bluntwas demureness personified at the ceremony in a powder blue gown with a high collar, puffy sleeves and a regal train. By the time she rocked up at the Vanity Fair party, though, she'd traded it for a figure-hugging gold number with floral and avian detailing. The sequins and tassles of her Givenchy gown ensured Wonder Woman starGal Gadotsparkled on the red carpet. Her post-show frock also twinkled, though this one came with a daring thigh slash and an ever more plunging neckline. Salma Hayekmade a bold statement at the ceremony with a tiered purple gown topped with elaborate crystal chain mail. The eccentricity continued afterwards with a pink Gucci gown customised by Harlem designer Dapper Dan. Best supporting actress winnerAllison Janneyrocked it in red in a Reem Acra gown with carpet-caressing angel sleeves. The I, Tonya star remained a scarlet woman at the Vanity Fair party... from the waist down at least. Margot Robbielooked ready to walk down the aisle in a Chanel Haute Couture gownshe reportedly mended herself,externalwhen one of its arm straps broke. That got traded at the Vanity Fair event for an intricately detailed ivory number with a sheer overlay, topped off by a sparkly globe-shaped purse. Emma Stone, last year's best actress winner, returned to the Oscars in a silk Louis Vuitton blazer adorned with a bright pink sash. A few hours later, she reappeared in a yellow and grey mini-dress. Zendaya, star of The Greatest Showman, seemed to have a circus tent in mind with this off-the-shoulder chocolate creation. The fishtail gown she wore at the Vanity Fair event was considerably more flattering to the 21-year-old's figure. Finally, here's Grammy-winning singer turned Oscar-nominated actressMary J Bligeshowing us how it's done in shimmering white, voluptuous red and glorious gold.

"Frances McDormand said she had ""two words"" for the Oscars audience - ""inclusion rider"" If this year's Oscars are remembered for anything, it may be for making the term ""inclusion rider"" common parlance. Mentioned by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech, it refers to a clause actors can insist be added to their contracts. ""[It] means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50% diversity, not only in casting but also [in] the crew,"" she explained backstage afterwards. Its mention prompted a dramatic surge of interest in the term on Google. Many people also searched for inclusion ""writer"", having misheard the final sentence of McDormand's rousing address. McDormand said she had only become aware of the term recently. But it's actually been around since 2016. It was coined by media researcher Stacy Smith ina TED talk,externalshe gave that year, in which she posited ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. This video can not be played Inclusion rider creator: 'It's a new day' after Frances McDormand's Oscar speech Dr Smith came up with the concept with Kalpana Kotagal, a civil rights and employment practice attorney in Washington DC, and the producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni. The University of Southern California professor argues that an ""equity clause"" in an A-list actor's contract could allow the film's minor on-screen roles ""to match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place"". Speaking to an audience in San Francisco, Dr Smith said: ""The typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it. I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story. ""The remaining 30 or so roles, there's no reason why those minor roles can't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place. ""An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live."" Brie Larson, pictured with Frances McDormand at the SAG awards, has pledged her support Speaking after the awards, Dr Smith said the mention had come as a ""complete surprise"" and that she was ""utterly elated"" that McDormand - who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - had so publicly championed her proposal. ""The goal is that talent can take the inclusion rider and adopt it in ways that make sense for their values and their beliefs,""she told The Guardian,external. The good news is that some A-listers are already taking the initiative when it comes to using their position to negotiate a more representative work space. ""I'm committed to the Inclusion Rider,""tweeted Brie Larson,external, Oscar-winning star of Room and the forthcoming Captain Marvel. ""Who's with me?"" McDormand also got the backing of former tennis playerBillie Jean King,external, British screenwriterJack Thorne,externaland Pitch Perfect starElizabeth Banks,external.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un welcomes South Korean officials North Korea is willing to talk about getting rid of its nuclear weapons but only if its own safety can be guaranteed, South Korea says. The South says the subject was raised when its officials met with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang on Monday, during a rare visit. They said Mr Kim is also open to US talks, and would pause weapons testing. In previous programmes to halt its nuclear ambitions, the North has failed to keep its promises. The leaders of North and South Korea have also agreed to meet at a summit next month, Seoul's envoy says. It will be the first such meeting for more than a decade and the first since Kim Jong-un took power in North Korea. Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet on the heavily fortified border next month, at the truce village of Panmunjom. The countries also agreed to open a hotline between the leaders. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? Fast-closing window for diplomacy post-Olympics Throughout February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two countries struck a friendly tone, sending athletes to compete in a joint team and holding talks. But the US maintained that North Korean gestures of rapprochement would carry little weight without a commitment on nuclear weapons - particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. The South Korean delegation is expected to visit Washington later this week to brief US officials on their talks in the North. A statement from the South Korea president's office said: ""The North showed willingness on denuclearisation in the Korean Peninsula. If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes."" Kim Jong-un was pictured welcoming delegates from the South to a dinner on Monday The North's KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had ""warmly welcomed"" the delegates and held an ""openhearted talk"" with them. It said the dinner took place ""in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings"". However, some critics have suspicions over North Korea's intentions. In the past, they have failed to follow through on deals, notably an aid-for-disarmament agreement in 2005. The United States has said it will only go in to formal talks with North Korea if Pyongyang is ready to give up its nuclear weapons. After the news from the South Korean officials was made public, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The World is watching and waiting!"" ""May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vice-President Mike Pence added: ""All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization."" Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it hopes the Koreas can continue with efforts to advance reconciliation, Reuters news agency reported. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent This is, of course, South Korea's take on what North Korea is offering. Some of the suggestions are, at face value, encouraging - not least North Korea's apparent willingness to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, its conditions - that the military threat to North Korea is reduced and regime safety is guaranteed - raise all sorts of questions. The North also says that it is willing to talk to the US with the goal of normalising relations with Washington. The most positive element is the most immediate; that the period of calm initiated by the Winter Olympics looks set to continue. ""While the dialogues continue,"" the South says, ""the North will not conduct any nuclear tests, missile launches or other provocations."" (Surely not Pyongyang's words!) The two Koreas appear willing to create diplomatic space to try to improve relations across the board. Much will now depend upon how Washington reacts. South Korean officials had a four-hour dinner with Kim Jong-un on Monday. Among the delegation were intelligence chief Suh Hoon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong. Pictures showed Mr Kim and visitors from the South smiling broadly around a dinner table. Also present was Mr Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, who rarely appears at official events, and his sister Kim Yo-jong, who was part of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon North Korea baby rumours fascinate South The two sides appear to be aiming to capitalise on the reduced tensions after the Games, which saw the Koreas march together under one flag. During their visit, the South's officials also held a boardroom meeting and passed on a letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which he invited Mr Kim to attend further talks. KCNA said Mr Kim had ""exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement"" on the letter and gave orders for it to be acted on. The South's delegates returned to Seoul on Tuesday morning, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. These were the first officials from Seoul to meet Mr Kim since he came to power. Kim Jong-un has met very few foreign officials since he became leader in 2011 and the last time envoys from the South visited Pyongyang was in 2007. Two previous summits were held in 2000 and 2007, under South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il. The South's officials have stressed the talks were only preliminary, but the parties had ""somewhat shared"" views on some issues.

"This video can not be played Footage shows the aid convoy reaching ""hell on earth"" A UN convoy delivering urgently needed aid to the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria has cut short its mission and left the enclave amid shelling. A UN refugee agency official said the convoy - the first since mid-February - delivered as much as it could in Douma town and left after nearly nine hours. But the UNHCR said 10 out of more than 40 trucks had not been emptied. Activists said dozens of people died in air strikes by Syria's army on Monday, despite a supposed five-hour truce. At least 719 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. The UNHCR's Syria representative Sajjad Malik tweeted late on Monday that ""we delivered as much as we could amidst shelling"". ""Civilians are caught in a tragic situation."" Allow Twitter content?

The Syrian Red Crescent earlier said 46 truckloads of food parcels were delivered to 27,500 people, along with health items for more than 70,000 people in the town of Douma. ""The convoy is a positive first step and will lessen the immediate suffering of some civilians in the Eastern Ghouta region,"" said Robert Maridni, Middle East Director of International Committee of the Red Cross. ""But one convoy, however big, will never be enough given the dire conditions and shortages people are facing. Repeated and continuous humanitarian access is essential and more must be granted in the coming period."" This video can not be played Relief convoy arrives in the Eastern Ghouta A World Health Organization official told Reuters that Syrian government officials had removed 70% of the supplies, which included surgical materials and trauma kits, from the trucks before they had left warehouses. This is believed to be part of the government's efforts to ensure rebels are not treated. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian government and its allied forces have reclaimed a third of the Eastern Ghouta in a matter of days, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which has a network of sources on the ground. The region had been under the control of Islamist and jihadist groups since the civil war began in 2012. This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes President Bashar al-Assad said on state television on Sunday that the offensive against ""terrorism"" should continue, and he dismissed dire assessments of the humanitarian situation in the enclave as ""ridiculous lies"". He said he supported a Russian-sponsored daily truce of five hours, to allow ""the majority of those in the Eastern Ghouta"" to escape the areas under the control of ""terrorists"". The US has condemned the government assault and said Russia, a key ally of Damascus, is killing innocent civilians. Neither the daily pause ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor the ordering of a nationwide ceasefire by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave. The UN says that the ""collective punishment of civilians is simply unacceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Instead of a much-needed reprieve, we continue to see more fighting, more death, and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed,"" UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said on Sunday. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Opposition sources and journalists on the ground say that hundreds of people have been fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa, south of Douma, and on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta. Residents, many of them women and children, are reported to have fled into the centre of the enclave to seek shelter. Fighting has intensified in Beit Sawa between government forces and the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as ""beyond critical"". Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region in two. Syrian state media say the army has advanced on several fronts, and has taken control of villages and farms while attacking from the eastern side of the enclave. The SOHR said government forces were 3km (two miles) from Douma. The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a phone call on Sunday that Syria and its Russian backers bore responsibility for the ""heart-breaking human suffering"", Downing Street said. The leaders agreed that Russia must act now to persuade the Syrian government to stop the bombing.
