"The UK Border Force found a dinghy and 12 migrants at Greatstone, Kent, on Monday Two UK Border Force boats will be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel in response to recent migrant crossings, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the operation would protect human life, as well as borders. Mr Javid met Border Force officials earlier after agreeing a joint action plan with France. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast on Monday, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. The home secretary said around 230 people tried to cross the Channel in December, but half of them were ""disrupted"" by French officials and did not leave France. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? No easy answers to migrant issue - Javid Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' The decision to recall the vessels was taken by the Home Office after some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - called for more Border Force patrols to be deployed. Only one of the five Border Force cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Dover Strait. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean. The Border Force also has three of its six coastal patrol vessels in the Channel, but the Home Office said this remained under ""constant review"". Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Mr Javid said the incidents around the Channel were still a ""serious concern"" to him, adding: ""It's both about protecting human life but also about protecting our borders. ""When it comes to human life, clearly I want to make sure that we are doing all we can to protect people. ""This is one of the most treacherous stretches of water. Twenty-one miles with people taking grave risk, really putting their lives into their own hands by taking this journey."" But in a message to those thinking of crossing the Channel this way, he added: ""We will do everything we can to make sure it is not a success, in the sense that I don't want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France they can get to Britain and then just get to stay."" By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe Correspondent The port of Calais The port at Calais is ringed with barbed wire and security fences, floodlights and cameras. Parked up in the dunes behind it are police vans full of officers monitoring the city and coast. It is here the refugees try to sneak through, boarding small boats in the dead of night. Mostly men from Iran, Afghanistan and Eritrea and elsewhere, they live in small, squalid encampments. Having trekked all the way from their home countries, the few hundred refugees here are determined to reach the UK in any way possible. Mohamed from Iran, told me he had tried twice in the past week, setting off in a tiny boat with 10 other men who had all paid smugglers to help them. He is trying to reach the UK because his wife and children are already there. On their first attempt they ran out of fuel. The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France. The reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains. It is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead. Mr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week. It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the ""deeply concerning rise"" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats. Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK. He told BBC News: ""What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain."" But Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised. He said: ""We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about. And they are refugees unless proved otherwise."" Writing on Twitter on Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" And speaking to the Guardian, his shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Mr Javid of exploiting the problem. She told the paper:,external""There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Ray Sawyer, of Dr Hook & the Medicine Show, died after a brief illness Ray Sawyer - the eye-patch wearing singer  with Dr Hook & the Medicine Show in the 1970s - has died, aged 81. His wife Linda said Sawyer died ""peacefully in his sleep,external"", adding that her ""heart is broken."" The band is best known for the song When You're in Love with a Beautiful Woman, which was a number one hit in the UK in 1979. Sawyer joined Dr Hook in 1969, two years after he lost an eye in a car accident. Despite not being the lead singer, his eye patch - and cowboy hat - meant he was the most easily recognised. But Sawyer, who was born in Chickasaw, Alabama, in 1937, did take lead vocals on one early hit, 1972's Cover of the Rolling Stone. In the song's lyrics, he sang: ""The biggest thrill we've never known is the thrill that'll getcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone."" Dr Hook did eventually appear - in caricature - on the front of the famous magazine in 1973. ""Here was this little band from Alabama standing on the corner saying,'Hey, put us on the cover', and it worked,"" he later said, according to Ultimate Classic Rock,external. ""It was a dream come true."" Sawyer (left) performs in New York with Dennis Locorriere in 1979 The band's other hits included Sylvia's Mother. Sawyer left the band in 1981 to pursue a solo career, but went on to spend much of his later career touring with a spin-off group named Dr Hook featuring Ray Sawyer. He retired just three years ago. Dennis Locorriere, who was one of the founders of Dr Hook with Sawyer, said ina statement to Rolling Stone magazine,externalthat though they had not spoken for years ""it does not erase the fact that we were once close friends and shared an important time in both our lives"". ""Deep condolences go out to his family at what must be a difficult time."" Fans posted tributes to Sawyer on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Eyewitnesses reported seeing about 50 police officers at the scene in Hammersmith Thirty-nine people at a house party were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in west London. The man, thought to be in his mid-30s, was found with life-threatening wounds when police were called to Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, at 01:00 GMT. The Metropolitan Police said the victim was chased by men and women following ""a minor argument"" in a shop. The arrested people have since been released from custody, officers said. The suspects were seen going into a property where there was a party. Officers tried to speak to those in the flat, but when they failed to co-operate 39 people were arrested. One witness said the group were ""lined up and interrogated"" for about an hour in the street. The injured man was treated at the scene by officers and paramedics. He is critically ill in hospital. London's year of deadly violence The city curing violence like a disease London violence 'to take 10 years to solve' Supt Mark Lawrence said: ""Whilst it is unusual for so many people to be arrested in the early stages of an investigation such as this, due to a lack of co-operation and the necessity of securing essential evidence following a serious assault this action was appropriate."" A tattoo parlour, the Southern Belle pub and a Sainsbury's Local supermarket are all within a police cordon, according to BBC Radio London's Greg McKenzie who has been reporting from the scene. Blood was seen on the pavement within one of the three taped off areas. Two knives were found nearby, said police. A tattoo parlour, a pub and a supermarket are all within the cordon in west London One woman said she saw a group of people running before hearing someone shouting: ""Get him."" ""All of a sudden, all of them in a rush together ran in that door [to the flat] together,"" she added. The witness, who did not want to be identified, said she saw the victim being treated by paramedics. She indicated he had been stabbed in the chest. A neighbour of the flat in Greyhound Road, where the arrests are thought to have been made, said the party had seemed ""quite relaxed and chilled"". ""We just heard normal talking. It sounded like squealing girls like you get on a night out,"" she added. Another neighbour, Mason El Hage, 22, said: ""I have never seen something like that in my life. It was very extreme in terms of the amount of people involved,"" he said. The graphic designer said he initially thought it was a drugs raid after he heard noise and dogs barking at about 01:30 GMT. ""After that, three riot vans rocked up and about 50 police officers marched down the road, went into the house next door and brought around 30 to 40 people outside,"" he said. ""They lined them up and interrogated them for about an hour."" Mr El Hage said the group, including young men and women, were arrested in ""single file"" in a ""very, very swift operation"". Four of them, all males, have been released on bail. Everyone else in the group - 20 males and 15 females, all aged between 16 and 22 - has been released while investigations continue.

"A UK firm contracted to provide extra ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit will only be paid if it runs ""an effective service"", the Department for Transport (DfT) says. Seaborne Freight was awarded Â£13.8m recently to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend. But a BBC investigation discovered ithad never run a ferry service before. Seaborne is contractually required to prove it can deliver on its promises, according to the DfT. On Sunday, the DfT stood by the firm, saying it had ""carefully vetted the company's commercial, technical and financial position"" before signing the deal. Seaborne, together with Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, were awarded a total of Â£102.9m over the last few months toprovide additional ferries between the UK and several European cities,in a bid to ease congestion at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The additional crossings - equivalent to about 10% of existing traffic across the Dover strait - would provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity. It was initially understood that the three firms were likely to retain a portion of their award even if their services were no longer needed, due to a Brexit deal being reached with Brussels. The DfT has now clarified that this will not be the case for Seaborne. The BBC understands that French firm Brittany Ferries will be entitled to retain some of the award in case its services are no longer required, as per its contract with the DfT. A spokesperson said: ""Seaborne Freight is obliged to meet a number of stringent time-staged requirements to demonstrate that it can provide an effective service, with break clauses in the DfT's favour if it fails to meet them. ""Taxpayer's money will only be transferred following the provision of an effective service."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March - following the result of the 2016 referendum. It and the EU have agreed a withdrawal agreement - or ""divorce deal"" - and a political declaration outlining ambition for future talks - but it needs to be agreed by Parliament for it to come into force. A vote by MPs on the deal had been scheduled for 11 December, but Prime Minister Theresa May postponed it until January when it became clear her deal would be rejected, leading to widespread anger in the Commons.

"For most of the year Venice's canals are crowded with boats Venice has won approval to introduce an entry fee of up to â¬10 (Â£9; $11.50) for short-stay tourists. Italy's budget for 2019 has a clause enabling Venice to impose the fee, which will especially target day-trippers arriving on cruise ships. Tourists already pay a similar ""landing tax"" when they visit Italy's tiny Aeolian Islands. Venetians have long complained that mass tourism is swamping the city, adored for its picturesque canals. Hundreds of cruise ships moor in Venice every year, allowing over a million passengers to see the city's sights. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the ""landing tax"" would generate much-needed income to keep the city clean. It is expected to be set at â¬2.50 to â¬5 per person, but at peak times in the summer it could rise to â¬10. Venice plans to have the tax in place for the 2019 high season. It will apply only to tourists, but it is not clear whether it will replace a city tax already levied on hotel occupants. That tax brings in about â¬30m annually, but the ""landing tax"" could generate more - an estimated â¬50m. This video can not be played Venetians are trying to find solutions to stop the exodus from their city Cruise passengers are easily identified, Italian officials say, but it may prove harder to tax day-trippers arriving by air, road or rail. Local residents, workers and students will be exempt. For years there have been protests by Venetians who say mass tourism is spoiling the city's character. Claudio Scarpa, head of the Venice hotel managers' association Ava, said ""the principle is that whoever visits from morning to evening, contributing just a tiny amount to the revenue from tourism, but imposing costs on our services, must understand that it's not all there for free"".

"This video can not be played Rescuers search for survivors after a gas explosion in a Russian apartment block Rescuers are searching for survivors in the central Russian city of Magnitogorsk, where an explosion devastated a block of flats, killing at least four people. Officials in the city, in the Urals region, say a gas leak caused the blast. About 40 people are missing. President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the city to assess the situation. The building was home to 120 people, and 48 flats collapsed in the blast. ""I woke up and felt myself falling,"" one witness told Russia television, according to news agency AFP. ""The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried."" Another witness spoke of a ""wave of fire"" which followed the blast. Rescue workers are now in a race against time to find survivors, as the daytime temperature in the industrial city is around -17C, falling further overnight. Few, if any, are expected to be pulled from the rubble, but rescue workers are due to work through the night in the hope of finding people alive. Just a handful of survivors have been found so far Russia's Vesti news channel says officials have accounted for more than 50 of the block's residents, including the victims. At least 16 survivors have been evacuated from the scene, including seven children. Five injured people, including two children, were taken to hospital, according to officials. President Putin, who came to see the rescue operation for himself, described it as a ""tragedy"", adding that those affected would get every assistance. ""First of all, I would like to express my condolences to the families of the victims, and to assure those affected that we will do everything to help and support them,"" he said. Rescuers are picking through a mountain of rubble There are more flats on either side of the collapsed block The blast, at 06:02 local time (01:02 GMT) is thought to have ripped through the first floor, which houses some offices, and the seven storeys above then collapsed. Nearby flats were also damaged. There are concerns another two sections of the block, which was built in 1973, could collapse. A criminal investigation has been opened into the disaster. The city is about 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow.

"The UK can ""turn a corner"" and start to ""put its differences aside"" if Parliament backs the proposed Brexit deal, Theresa May has said. In her new year message, the prime minister said 2019 would mark a new chapter for the country outside the EU. Should MPs approve the exit terms later this month, she said the UK could ""move forward together"" and concentrate on other issues like housing and health. Labour has said the Brexit process is a ""complete mess"" due to Tory divisions. The UK is scheduled to leave the union on 29 March, but it is unclear what will happen if MPs reject the withdrawal agreement and the framework for future relations. Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Sturgeon: EU migrants welcome in Scotland US ambassador issues trade deal warning MPs are due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the proposals reached with the EU. Downing Street has said there is ""still work to do"" - as the PM seeks to persuade sceptical Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the agreement does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. The prime minister is continuing to seek further assurances from European leaders about aspects of the agreement, notably the controversial Irish border ""backstop"", designed to prevent physical customs checks on the island of Ireland.

In her message, Mrs May said MPs had an ""important decision to make"". ""In 2019 the UK will start a new chapter. The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people. If Parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner. ""The referendum in 2016 was divisive. But we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together, into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation."" An orderly Brexit, she argued, would enable the UK to ""focus its energy"" on other challenges, such as addressing housing shortages, improving technical education and ensuring the Â£20bn in extra spending planned for the NHS during the next five years ensures the health service continues to be ""there for us when we need it"". With employment at a record high and debt falling, the PM said the UK's economic foundations were strong but she acknowledged more needed to be done to ensure ""everyone in every community can feel the benefit"". Labour has warned uncertainty over Brexit has plunged the country into a state of crisis and the agreement on the table would not satisfy either Leave or Remain voters. The opposition is seeking to force a general election by calling a vote of no confidence in the government if the deal is rejected by MPs.

"Groups of people have been crossing the Channel in small boats in recent weeks More than 230 people have attempted to cross the English Channel in small boats since November, according to a tally being kept by BBC News. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has declared the crossings ""a major incident"". Mr Javid said that while the UK had ""obligations to genuine asylum seekers which we will uphold, we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our global society"". So how many of those who've crossed the Channel in recent weeks are claiming asylum? The Home Office declined to give details. But if all of them did so, it would be equivalent to the number of people who claim asylum in the UK every three days. In 2017, there were 26,350 applications for asylum made in the UK. This compares with 198,255 applications for asylum made in Germany, 126,550 in Italy and 91,070 in France over the same period. In total in the UK, there were 21,290 decisions made with 31.8% gaining some form of protection. The UK grants ""refugee status"" to those who areunable to live in their own country for fear of persecution,externalbecause of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or other factors such as sexual orientation.  A successful application usually allows someone leave to remain for five years with the opportunity after that to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Data on how migrants arrive in the UK is not readily available, but areport by the Migration Advisory Committee,externalreleased in May 2018 provides estimates for ""clandestine entries"". These include those arriving by boat, but also those who stow away on ferries and lorries. In 2016-17 the figure was estimated to be 2,366, decreasing to 1,832 in 2017-18. The report does not say what proportion of these people went on to seek asylum. The largest group seeking asylum in the UK last year was from Iran, which is where many of the groups crossing the channel recently are reported to have come from. Of the 2,690 seeking asylum, 47% were granted it based on the initial decision - higher than average for asylum seekers as a whole. These statistics cover cases in which decisions are made. The rest are counted as ""pending"". At the end of last year, there were 24,557 people waiting for an asylum decision of whom 42% had been waiting more than six months, which is the Home Office's target for initial rulings to be made. Those decisions may then be challenged in court, and the majority of those who are initially unsuccessful go down this route. Of the 14,149 appeals determined in 2017, 5,022 - a third - were allowed, in effect overturning the Home Office's initial decision. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"The group of 12 migrants included a 10-year-old child Twelve migrants, including a 10-year-old child, have been detained after landing on a Kent beach. Nine men, two women and the child arrived at Greatstone after crossing the English Channel in a black dinghy. A Home Office spokesperson said the people ""presented themselves"" as Iranian nationals after police contacted Border Force officials. They received a medical assessment and were transferred to immigration officials for interview. Witnesses described seeing a large police presence along the quiet stretch of coastline. The group was detained after landing at Greatstone beach, a quiet stretch of coastline Chris Matcham said: ""I was driving towards New Romney this morning with my sister when a police car came haring past us along the road. ""We then saw the police car and van on the sea-side of the road a bit further down. ""We saw what we suspected were immigrants standing by the van on the pavement. ""Then I went for a walk 30 minutes later and lots of police helicopters were flying overhead."" Six men, all Iranian nationals, were found on a beach next to an inflatable boat at Kingsdown on Sunday. Home Secretary Sajid Javid declared a ""major incident"" on Friday after dozens of people in small boats arrived on the Kent coast over the Christmas period. More than 230 people have attempted the crossing in small boats since November. The rising number of migrants crossing the Channel will bediscussed by Mr Javid at a meetingwith other senior government officials, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency.

"Scotland's party leaders have issued their new year messages, as Brexit promises to dominate politics in 2019. Nicola Sturgeon sought to assure European Union migrants that they would always be welcome in Scotland. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservatives interim leader, said there was ""cause of optimism"" as the UK begins its departure from the EU. And Scottish Labour's Richard Leonard called for renewed ""ambition and hope"" in politics. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green's co-convenor, said his party was ready to offer a ""positive vision of a sustainable future and a fairer, more equal society."" Meanwhile, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats Willie Rennie said he wanted to push for unity in 2019, rather than ""bitter division"". The Scottish government will work""to protect Scotland's place at the heart of Europe"" in 2019, Nicola Sturgeon has said,externalin her new year message. The first minister said: ""One of the things we should be proud of, at Hogmanay, is the number of people from around the world who come to Scotland to see in the new year. ""They come in part because of Scotland's reputation for offering a warm welcome for all. That's a reputation we should cherish. And it's one which will endure, regardless of the changes we may see in 2019."" She said that, whatever the outcome of Brexit, Scotland would always welcome visitors from around the world. ""In fact, our reputation for being an open, warm-hearted, hospitable country has never been more important,"" she added. ""I want to make that especially clear to the hundreds of thousands of nationals from other European Union countries, who have done us the honour of choosing Scotland as their home. ""I know that this is a deeply uncertain time for you. But I also want you to know that your contribution to our national life - to our economy, communities and society - is hugely valued. You will always be welcome here."" Jackson Carlaw, who is the Scottish Conservatives' interim leader while Ruth Davidson takes maternity leave, said there was cause for optimism about the future. He said: ""There is no getting away from the fact that, as we look ahead at 2019 and our departure from the EU, the path we're about to take is hard to make out. ""And it's only a statement of the obvious to say that there are many views across the country about how best to travel. ""For many of those people who, in 2016, supported a new future for Britain outside the European Union, this is an exciting and liberating moment and offers the promise of something better. ""But for those who wanted to stay, many are understandably uncertain and nervous, angry even. That is the nature of changing times. ""The next few weeks will be a momentous moment in our country's history - and none of us can predict exactly how it is going to turn out. But as we go through this period, I believe that we all have good cause to do so with a well-grounded optimism in our future."" Richard Leonard used his new year message to highlight the upcoming 20th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish Parliament by Donald Dewar. Mr Leonard said the former first minister's speech was ""full of ambition and hope"". He continued: ""Twenty years on, what has happened to that ambition and hope? Poverty, homelessness and food banks now so rife they're almost taken for granted. ""Our National Health Service, schools and local services stretched to breaking point. An economy flagging and manufacturing jobs lost."" He said the power Scotland now had was not being used to improve people's lives. ""So we must renew that founding spirit,"" he added. ""That ambition, that power can mean real change."" Patrick Harvie hailed a ""new wave"" of political engagement which has risen in 2018 as the ""foundations of our democracy"" were tested. ""From a fresh generation of climate campaigners who refuse to accept the current inaction, to the Green New Deal movement in the US showing that a rational and science-led response to environmental challenges can offer hope for a better life for their citizens,"" he added. The Scottish Greens co-convenor said he wanted to halt Brexit and ""safeguard"" Scotland's future in Europe. ""So 2019 looks set to be just as challenging as the year gone by. The Greens are ready to offer our positive vision of a sustainable future and a fairer, more equal society; an internationalist Scotland ready to take its place on the world stage and to build peace and friendship instead of fences and walls. ""In parliament, in councils, and in every community in the country, we're resolved to keep putting those values into practice."" Willie Rennie alluded to the fallout from Brexit as he described 2018 as a ""chaotic and divisive year"" in his new year message. ""We need to draw a line under it and use 2019 to get back on track,"" the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems said. ""People who play their part in their community should have the opportunity to get a decent job, afford their own home and rely on good public services, with a government on their side. ""That's not the reality for millions of people in our country today."" He added: ""We have a real opportunity this year to push for unity, rather than bitter division. ""To stand with our neighbours in the UK and Europe because through partnership we can achieve so much more. Pushing power away from central government and into communities is important too if we are to reflect the rich diversity of our country.""

"The UK Border Force found a dinghy and 12 migrants at Greatstone, Kent, on Monday Two UK Border Force boats will be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel in response to recent migrant crossings, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the operation would protect human life, as well as borders. Mr Javid met Border Force officials earlier after agreeing a joint action plan with France. Twelve migrants were found on the Kent coast on Monday, bringing the total number of people to have reached the UK by boat since November to 239. The home secretary said around 230 people tried to cross the Channel in December, but half of them were ""disrupted"" by French officials and did not leave France. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? No easy answers to migrant issue - Javid Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' The decision to recall the vessels was taken by the Home Office after some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - called for more Border Force patrols to be deployed. Only one of the five Border Force cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - had been working in the Dover Strait. The two being brought back are currently in the Mediterranean. The Border Force also has three of its six coastal patrol vessels in the Channel, but the Home Office said this remained under ""constant review"". Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Mr Javid said the incidents around the Channel were still a ""serious concern"" to him, adding: ""It's both about protecting human life but also about protecting our borders. ""When it comes to human life, clearly I want to make sure that we are doing all we can to protect people. ""This is one of the most treacherous stretches of water. Twenty-one miles with people taking grave risk, really putting their lives into their own hands by taking this journey."" But in a message to those thinking of crossing the Channel this way, he added: ""We will do everything we can to make sure it is not a success, in the sense that I don't want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France they can get to Britain and then just get to stay."" By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe Correspondent The port of Calais The port at Calais is ringed with barbed wire and security fences, floodlights and cameras. Parked up in the dunes behind it are police vans full of officers monitoring the city and coast. It is here the refugees try to sneak through, boarding small boats in the dead of night. Mostly men from Iran, Afghanistan and Eritrea and elsewhere, they live in small, squalid encampments. Having trekked all the way from their home countries, the few hundred refugees here are determined to reach the UK in any way possible. Mohamed from Iran, told me he had tried twice in the past week, setting off in a tiny boat with 10 other men who had all paid smugglers to help them. He is trying to reach the UK because his wife and children are already there. On their first attempt they ran out of fuel. The second time they got close to the English coast and phoned 999, seeking assistance from UK coastguards, but he said a French vessel turned up instead and they were returned to France. The reason refugees are increasingly trying the sea crossing, we were told, is that heightened security around French ports and the Channel tunnel has made it almost impossible to stow away on lorries and trains. It is in desperation that people are turning to boats instead. Mr Javid, who returned from a family holiday in South Africa after coming under pressure to act, earlier agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to be put in place in the coming week. It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Theresa May supported the home secretary's work to tackle the ""deeply concerning rise"" in migrants crossing the Channel on small boats. Two more cutters will be deployed in the Channel Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was important illegal migrants were not allowed to stay in the UK. He told BBC News: ""What we need to see now is this Dover patrol work hand in glove with the French authorities in a new Channel compact, so that anyone found in the English Channel in one of these unseaworthy craft can be helped carefully and safely back to the French coast - so that they know there is no chance of getting into Britain."" But Ben Bano, from the Seeking Sanctuary migrant support group, warned migrants should not be demonised. He said: ""We have to hold on to the fact that people, however desperate they are, are our brothers and sisters in humanity, and that is what we need to keep reminding people about. And they are refugees unless proved otherwise."" Writing on Twitter on Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" And speaking to the Guardian, his shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Mr Javid of exploiting the problem. She told the paper:,external""There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"A UK firm contracted to provide extra ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit will only be paid if it runs ""an effective service"", the Department for Transport (DfT) says. Seaborne Freight was awarded Â£13.8m recently to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend. But a BBC investigation discovered ithad never run a ferry service before. Seaborne is contractually required to prove it can deliver on its promises, according to the DfT. On Sunday, the DfT stood by the firm, saying it had ""carefully vetted the company's commercial, technical and financial position"" before signing the deal. Seaborne, together with Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, were awarded a total of Â£102.9m over the last few months toprovide additional ferries between the UK and several European cities,in a bid to ease congestion at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The additional crossings - equivalent to about 10% of existing traffic across the Dover strait - would provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity. It was initially understood that the three firms were likely to retain a portion of their award even if their services were no longer needed, due to a Brexit deal being reached with Brussels. The DfT has now clarified that this will not be the case for Seaborne. The BBC understands that French firm Brittany Ferries will be entitled to retain some of the award in case its services are no longer required, as per its contract with the DfT. A spokesperson said: ""Seaborne Freight is obliged to meet a number of stringent time-staged requirements to demonstrate that it can provide an effective service, with break clauses in the DfT's favour if it fails to meet them. ""Taxpayer's money will only be transferred following the provision of an effective service."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March - following the result of the 2016 referendum. It and the EU have agreed a withdrawal agreement - or ""divorce deal"" - and a political declaration outlining ambition for future talks - but it needs to be agreed by Parliament for it to come into force. A vote by MPs on the deal had been scheduled for 11 December, but Prime Minister Theresa May postponed it until January when it became clear her deal would be rejected, leading to widespread anger in the Commons.

"Roxy (pictured) will now be reunited with her old cat friend George, although will have to contend with her replacement Harley A cat which had been missing for five years has been reunited with her owners. Roxy, seven, escaped during a visit to the vets in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire in 2013. Owner Vicky Stokes, 35, scoured the streets searching for her and put up posters of the beloved tabby, all to no avail. But after a bedraggled Roxy started hanging around in Amy Ward's garden recently, she took her in. Vicky Stokes put posters of her beloved cat all over the local area Miss Ward said: ""She looked really thin and obviously had fleas so we started feeding her and even called out the RSPCA to try and catch her but she freaked out. ""I even tried to put her in a box but she nearly tore me to pieces so we just started feeding her closer and closer to the house."" Rap star Snoop offers home to namesake dog Injured police dog finds 'forever home' On the streets helping homeless pets Gradually Miss Ward won Roxy's trust and she started coming inside and was able to give her several flea treatments and then entice her into a box. She unknowingly took the cat back to the very same vets she had disappeared from and as she was microchipped they were able to trace her owner. Mrs Stokes, who has since moved and had two daughters - aged four and nine months - received a phone call on 29 December. She said: ""She is our little Christmas miracle, we are totally elated. ""I thought she was dead but she seems OK, we are so grateful to Amy for bringing her in."" Roxy is thought to be in good health but will be thoroughly checked over by a vet on January 2 Roxy is currently enjoying pride of place on her owners' bed, much to the disgust of her replacement Harley, Mrs Stokes said.

"Investors will be glad to see the back of 2018 after many global stock markets suffered their worst year in a decade. The FTSE 100's traditional early New Year's Eve close saw it end the year down 12% at 6,728.13 points. Big European and Asian markets faced similar losses in 2018, while the main US indexes saw their worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones ended the year down 5.6%, the wider S&P 500 fell 6.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.9%. US-China trade woes and slower global growth are among issues blamed for the poor showing. Analysts have also cited US political uncertainty and interest rate rises as contributing factors. As the year ended,the US was still in the grip of a government shutdowncaused by President Donald Trump's determination to secure funding for a wall on the Mexican border to tackle illegal immigration. Mr Trump has also regularly rattled investors during the year by escalating his tit-for-tattrade tariff battle with China. Earlier this month, both sides agreed to suspend new tariffs to allow for talks. The president has also been at odds with the central bank, the Federal Reserve, over whether interest rates should be increased. At the same time, Europe has been rocked by political setbacks including Italy's budget row with Brussels, the waning authority of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the ""gilets jaunes"" protesters in France and, of course, Brexit. Fed raises rates despite Trump opposition Italy passes budget after EU standoff Angela Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Macron promises divide protest leaders EU bewildered by Brexit confusion Although sizeable in historic terms, the US stock market falls were smaller in scale than those seen elsewhere, arguably in part because of the economic stimulus provided by the Trump administration's $1.5tnTax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017. In Asia on Monday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed almost 14% down on the year, while the Nikkei fell almost 15% in 2018 and China's Shanghai Composite (SSE) saw a whopping 25% annual decline. In some territories, including the US, shares saw a modest upturn in thin New Year's Eve trading, boosted by optimism over the latest twist in US-Chinese trade relations. Investors drew some comfort from the latest comments by Mr Trump, who tweeted that he had had a ""long and very good call"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that a possible trade deal was making good progress. In the context of the year's overall market performance, however, it was too little, too late.

"The group of 12 migrants included a 10-year-old child Twelve migrants, including a 10-year-old child, have been detained after landing on a Kent beach. Nine men, two women and the child arrived at Greatstone after crossing the English Channel in a black dinghy. A Home Office spokesperson said the people ""presented themselves"" as Iranian nationals after police contacted Border Force officials. They received a medical assessment and were transferred to immigration officials for interview. Witnesses described seeing a large police presence along the quiet stretch of coastline. The group was detained after landing at Greatstone beach, a quiet stretch of coastline Chris Matcham said: ""I was driving towards New Romney this morning with my sister when a police car came haring past us along the road. ""We then saw the police car and van on the sea-side of the road a bit further down. ""We saw what we suspected were immigrants standing by the van on the pavement. ""Then I went for a walk 30 minutes later and lots of police helicopters were flying overhead."" Six men, all Iranian nationals, were found on a beach next to an inflatable boat at Kingsdown on Sunday. Home Secretary Sajid Javid declared a ""major incident"" on Friday after dozens of people in small boats arrived on the Kent coast over the Christmas period. More than 230 people have attempted the crossing in small boats since November. The rising number of migrants crossing the Channel will bediscussed by Mr Javid at a meetingwith other senior government officials, the Border Force and the National Crime Agency. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Javid said: ""The reasons behind the increased crossings are complicated and in many cases outside of our control. ""Unfortunately, this means that there are no easy answers.  So our response is focused both here in the UK and abroad.""

"Groups of people have been crossing the Channel in small boats in recent weeks More than 230 people have attempted to cross the English Channel in small boats since November, according to a tally being kept by BBC News. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has declared the crossings ""a major incident"". Mr Javid said that while the UK had ""obligations to genuine asylum seekers which we will uphold, we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our global society"". So how many of those who've crossed the Channel in recent weeks are claiming asylum? The Home Office declined to give details. But if all of them did so, it would be equivalent to the number of people who claim asylum in the UK every three days. In 2017, there were 26,350 applications for asylum made in the UK. This compares with 198,255 applications for asylum made in Germany, 126,550 in Italy and 91,070 in France over the same period. In total in the UK, there were 21,290 decisions made with 31.8% gaining some form of protection. The UK grants ""refugee status"" to those who areunable to live in their own country for fear of persecution,externalbecause of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or other factors such as sexual orientation.  A successful application usually allows someone leave to remain for five years with the opportunity after that to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Data on how migrants arrive in the UK is not readily available, but areport by the Migration Advisory Committee,externalreleased in May 2018 provides estimates for ""clandestine entries"". These include those arriving by boat, but also those who stow away on ferries and lorries. In 2016-17 the figure was estimated to be 2,366, decreasing to 1,832 in 2017-18. The report does not say what proportion of these people went on to seek asylum. The largest group seeking asylum in the UK last year was from Iran, which is where many of the groups crossing the channel recently are reported to have come from. Of the 2,690 seeking asylum, 47% were granted it based on the initial decision - higher than average for asylum seekers as a whole. These statistics cover cases in which decisions are made. The rest are counted as ""pending"". At the end of last year, there were 24,557 people waiting for an asylum decision of whom 42% had been waiting more than six months, which is the Home Office's target for initial rulings to be made. Those decisions may then be challenged in court, and the majority of those who are initially unsuccessful go down this route. Of the 14,149 appeals determined in 2017, 5,022 - a third - were allowed, in effect overturning the Home Office's initial decision.

"Jackie Chan (L) starred in the film Shinjuku Incident alongside Daniel Wu (R) Iran's state broadcaster, Irib, has sacked the head of a regional TV channel after it broadcast a Jackie Chan film without removing a sex scene. A video posted online apparently by a viewer on Kish Island showed the Hong Kong martial arts star having sex with a woman in the film Shinjuku Incident. Iranian media said the ""immoral"" scene was aired by Kish TV in ""total violation of Irib's regulations"". Physical contact between men and women is not permitted on screen in Iran. Censors are also said to be required to remove men and women exchanging ""tender words or jokes"", unveiled women, close-ups of women's faces and exposed necklines, as well as negative portrayals of police and bearded men. Buffalo bottoms too much for Iran TV Iran TV censors Italian football badge The Tasnim news agency reported that the head of Irib, Aliasgari Ali Askari, had ordered an investigation into the incident and pledged ""to seriously deal with the offenders and report them to the relevant authorities"". Some Iranians mocked the broadcaster's response on social media using the hashtag #Kish_channel in Persian. Some noted that officials had so far avoided dismissal over the fatal bus crash that killed 10 students at Tehran's Islamic Azad University last week. ""Buses turn over, planes crash, ships sink... no-one is dismissed...

"This video can not be played Cane toads ride on python's back after thunderstorm Some called it the Outback Uber - 10 cane toads have been caught riding a python. Paul Mock, of Kununurra in the far north of Western Australia, filmed the bizarre sight after a heavy thunderstorm on Sunday night. The animals were trying to escape an overflowing dam on the Mocks' property when the toads came up with the novel form of transport. Mr Mock sent the images to his brother Andrew, who then posted them online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Mock explains he had ventured out after a bad thunderstorm that dropped close to 7cm (2.7in) of rain on Kununurra in the space of an hour. ""I went out and the lake had overflowed,"" he says, and realised the toads, who nested around its edge, were fleeing the rising waters.

And the python seems smart enough not to have tried to eat his passengers - cane toads carry a deadly toxin which can threaten even larger species like snakes, lizards and crocodiles.

"There has been a wave of criticism after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said he sexually assaulted a maid when he was a teenager. In a speech, he recalled confessing to a priest how he reached into the maid's underwear as she slept. Women's rights group Gabriela said Mr Duterte was ""unworthy of his position and should resign"". The Philippines president has sparked outrage with a number of provocative comments but remains popular. In his latest remarks, he described entering the room of his maid while she was sleeping. ""I lifted the blanket... I tried to touch what was inside the panty,"" he said. ""I was touching. She woke up so I left the room."" He said he told the priest that he later returned to the woman's room and tried to molest her again. Mr Duterte said the priest told him to say ""five Our Fathers, five Hail Mary's, because you will go to hell"",,externalaccording to news website Rappler. It is common for well-off families in the Philippines to employ maids and many women also work as domestic helpers across Asia and the Middle East. Mr Duterte's spokesman has since said that the president had merely ""made up"" and ""added and spliced"" the story during his speech on Saturday. Outrage as Duterte kisses worker on stage Philippines' Duterte calls God 'stupid' Filipino leader says he killed as a teen Rights groups in the Philippines have strongly condemned the comments, which were made as part of a tirade against the Catholic Church over the sexual abuse of children. This video can not be played âRape jokes are not OK,â feminist punks tell Duterte Gabriela, a political party representing women's rights groups, said the comments were tantamount to admitting rape. ""Rape does not happen only through penile insertion,"" the organisation's secretary general Joms Salvador said. ""If it is a finger or an object it is considered rape."" The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific warned that the president's comments put domestic workers at risk. ""Flaunting abusive practices encourages the rape culture and in this case, sexual abuse of domestic workers,"" said executive director Jean Enriquez. More than one million Filipinos work overseas as domestic workers, according to government figures. Mr Duterte has been a fierce critic of the Catholic Church, which has criticised his bloody drug war that seen thousands of people killed. The Philippines president has drawn fire for previous actions and comments about women. Earlier this year, he sparked criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. This video can not be played Mr Duterte has sparked controversy before He also told Filipino soldiers they should shoot female communist rebels in the vagina. In April 2016, he spoke to an election campaign rally about the 1989 murder and rape of a female Australian missionary in Davao, where he was mayor at the time. ""I was angry because she was raped,"" he said. ""That's one thing. But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first, what a waste."" His office later apologised.

"Traffic has reopened after the road was closed this morning A main route between England and Wales was closed after a man climbed a bridge and flew a drone from the top. Traffic was stopped on the M48 - the older of two Severn crossings - because of ""concern for welfare,"" police said. The man, in his 20s, came down voluntarily from the 47m (154ft) bridge tower and was arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance. Highways England said it was deeply concerned and that ""a person has put their life at serious risk"".

"President Trump announced the withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria A top Republican has said US President Donald Trump remains committed to defeating Islamic State (IS) in Syria, despite his plan to withdraw US troops. Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the withdrawal had been slowed and he was now reassured of the president's commitment after meeting him on Sunday. Mr Trump's troop pullout plan met strong criticism from major allies, and senior Republicans like Mr Graham. The White House has yet to comment on Mr Graham's remarks. ""I think we're in a pause situation where we are re-evaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective of having people pay more and do more,"" Mr. Graham said. He did not explain this, butThe New York Times reports,externalthat he may be referring to assurances given to military officials that they can have longer than 30 days to ensure an orderly withdrawal of troops. On 19 December,Mr Trump announced the pullout of some 2,000 troops, asserting that IS had been defeated. Critics of the plan dispute this claim, arguingthe move could lead to a resurgence of ISwhich would hurt national security. US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two people have resigned since the decision was announced- Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and a top US official in the fight against IS, Brett McGurk. Trump rewrites US-Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Why the battle for northern Syria matters Lindsey Graham, who had earlier called the withdrawal decision a ""huge Obama-like mistake"", told journalists: ""The president assured me he is going to make sure he gets the job done. Mr Trump heard how IS is not ""completely destroyed"" during a Christmas visit to troops in Iraq, Mr Graham said ""He promised to destroy Isis. He's going to keep that promise. ""I think we're slowing things down in a smart way,"" the South Carolina senator said. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus suggests thatMr Trump appears to be washing his hands of Syriaand handing the whole job over to Russia, Turkey and Iran. Speaking later on CNN, Mr Graham also expressed concern that the US withdrawal would leave ""our allies the Kurds"" in the north of Syria exposed to attacks from Turkey. ""If we leave now, the Kurds are going to get slaughtered,"" he said. ""The president is reconsidering how we do this. He's frustrated, I get that."" US ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS. The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos. Over the intervening years the numbers of US troops in Syria increased, standing today at some 2,000, though some estimates place the number perhaps even higher. A network of bases and airstrips has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country.

"Woody Johnson with Donald and Melania Trump on their UK visit this summer Donald Trump's offer of a ""quick, massive, bilateral trade deal"" will not be possible if Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement is approved, the US ambassador to the UK has warned. President Trump had previously said her Brexit proposal sounded like a""great deal for the EU"". Woody Johnson told the BBC the UK was ""in need of leadership"" over Brexit. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Johnson recently said the UK was ""the perfect trading partner for the US"". The UK-US trade relationship in five charts What are the challenges ahead for a UK-US trade deal? Mr Johnson told Radio 4's Today programme there was still hope for a UK-US trade deal. ""What I'm focusing on here is something the president has also said - that is looking forward to, and hoping, that the environment will lead to the ability for the US to do a quick, very massive bilateral trade deal,"" he said. He added it could be ""the precursor of future trade deals with other countries around the world for Great Britain that will really take you way, way into an exciting future"". ""We're still going through the stages of deciding exactly where the country is going,"" said Mr Johnson. ""If it goes in a way that allows these kinds of agreements to occur then I think that will be very positive in the president's eyes."" Johnson said a trade deal with the US would be ""positive"" in Mr Trump's eyes Asked if that would go ahead under the current proposed Brexit deal, which MPs are due to vote on in January, he replied: ""It doesn't look like it would be possible."" He said ministers - and the prime minister - had to ""measure the impact of all the other trade offs"" and how different trade agreements would benefit the UK. Please upgrade your browser Mr Trump has said Mrs May's deal could leave Britain unable to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the US. Mr Johnson did not give more details about what such a deal would entail. However, while the UK is either in a transition period after Brexit - or in a temporary customs union - it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, with the US or any other third country. Reacting to Mr Johnson's comments on Brexit, the Downing Street spokeswoman said both the UK and the US had been clear that ""we want an ambitious trade agreement and we stand ready to conclude such an agreement as a priority after we leave the European Union"". Is Trump right about Brexit? The cost of Trump's UK visit President Trump met the Queen in July - could a state visit be on the cards for 2019? Mr Johnson also said that he had been surprised by the ""defeatism"" felt in the UK over Brexit. ""All of the reporting looks back and it looks at a very static future, rather than an active British future - about solving problems, entrepreneurialism and taking advantage of opportunities and being very innovative,"" said Mr Johnson. ""If you look back and try to project the past into the present and future, it's going to be bleak. ""But you're leaving out the great thing that Britain has to offer and that is all of the people and all of their efforts and their ability to solve problems. If you factor that in, I think the future is extremely positive, extremely bright."" He added that it would be ""great"" if President Trump's postponed state visit could take place in May, around the time of World War Two commemorations - if his schedule, and that of the Queen, allowed.

Storm Usman hit the Bicol region southeast of capital Manila on Saturday. At least 17 people are missing and the death toll is expected to rise. One official told AFP news agency that people did not take precautions as it was not classed as a typhoon under the government's alert system.

"This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 More than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks. Why? On 23 November, shortly before sunrise, eight migrants were foundclinging to a dinghy in choppy watersoff the coast of Kent. They told their rescuers they had spent 12 hours at sea. It was a similar story the day before, when seven more were found in a boat just off the Dover coast - the same number of people had been pulled from an inflatable boat just a few hours earlier. Since 3 November, 101 migrants - including four children - have attempted the 21-mile journey across the Channel, one whichpolice have likenedto ""trying to cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Border Force was called to Dover's marina on 22 November to deal with seven suspected migrants The Home Office has refused to publish official figures, but the BBC has established that at least that number have entered British shores since the start of the month. Without fail, the migrants have told officials they are Iranian. British and French authorities, under pressure to stem the rise in boat trips before a life is lost, face several questions. Why have so many boats set off for the coast of Kent? What can be done to stop it? And why are all the occupants apparently from the Middle Eastern country? The answer to the last question could lie 1,200 miles away in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A French helicopter joined the rescue effort on 22 November Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, believes migrants arriving in the UK are among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August last year. The move was ostensibly intended to increase tourism and trade between Iran, the world's 25th largest economy, and Serbia, the 90th. The visa scheme - which attracted allegations it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe - ended on 17 October, by which time some 40,000 Iranians were said to have flown to the Balkan nation. It is unknown how many returned home, but according to the Associated Press, local media reported that direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade had been arriving full and returning empty. BBC reporter Simon Jones tweeted a picture of this boat after one rescue near Dover According to Info Park, a refugee support centre in Belgrade, Serbian police estimate the number of Iranians who failed to return at 12,000. Mr ÄakiÄ said it was believed within the refugee community that Iranians were using ""false passports and more complex methods"" to enter western Europe. They arrived better prepared for the journey ahead and would stay in hostels or hotels. Most refugees in Serbia slept in squats, while Iranians reportedly stayed in hotels Meanwhile, refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, travelled thousands of kilometres on foot and ended up living on the streets or in derelict buildings across Belgrade. Compared to fellow migrants, the Iranians looked ""more like tourists... they were kids in hoodies and jeans, with backpacks"", said Gordan Paunovic, of Info Park. ""Many of [the Iranians] were travelling with fake passports, which were costing between 3,000 to 6,000 euros in Istanbul. ""They didn't share the normal fate of refugees and migrants who have a very hard time in the Balkans. They would not be forced to sleep rough or go to refugee centres like the other people. ""They were here for a month, staying in hotels, and would find a smuggler to make other arrangements."" Iranians were said not to have shared ""the normal fate"" of migrants in the Balkans Iranians may be set apart from fellow migrants by their economic prosperity, yet for many living under the repressive regime, life is far from easy. Kaveh Kalantri, of the Iranian Association, which supports refugees in the UK, said a lack of freedom and human rights violations were driving some Iranians out. ""People get arrested if they have liberal or left-wing views, or if they are from religious minorities. A lot of people experience violence on a daily basis."" Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 Iranians have left the country every year. In the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality, according to Home Office figures. In 2017, they accounted for 9% of the 26,350 applications. ""Iranians coming to the UK is not unusual, but the way they are coming is,"" Mr Kalantri said. Tens of thousands of Iranians are said to have flown into Belgrade One theory as to why Iranians are choosing to risk their lives on boats stems from their comparative wealth - simply put, they can afford to pay smuggling gangs to get them onboard a vessel. Maya Konforti, of L'Auberge des Migrants, a refugee support group in Calais, described the attempted crossings as ""the speciality of Iranians"". ""Crossing by boat can only be done by people who have some money. Africans don't have any left by the time they arrive in Calais,"" she said. ""There is a new influx of Iranians arriving in Calais. They seem to be the only ones who both dare to do it and find the means to do so."" The Calais Jungle was dismantled in 2016, but migrants from across Africa and the Middle East continue to live in camps Mr ÄakiÄ suggested Iranians heading for Kent had entered the EU via Serbia. ""I don't see any other explanation. Serbia was the only country on the Balkan Route that had a significant number of Iranians."" Not everyone believes all the migrants are Iranian. Prof Adib-Moghaddam, from the Centre for Iranian Studies at SOAS University of London, suspects most of them are of Afghan origin. However, immigration specialist Emma Nawaz said she ""could not see what benefit they would achieve by falsely saying that they are Iranian"". Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Which industries employ European workers? How has EU migration changed the UK? Regardless, the ""surge"" in attempts is being fuelled by ""organised criminal and mafia networks"" in France, according to Ingrid Parrot, who works for the Maritime prefecture - the Border Force equivalent based in Cherbourg. She said there had been 30 attempted crossings in 2018, 12 in 2017, and 23 the year before. The majority failed because the vessels were too small - mostly canoes, dinghies and ""makeshift"" boats - but several attempts in 2018 have been made in pleasure crafts and speedboats, which have seen a spike in thefts. Ingrid Parrot says ""our fear is having bodies on the beaches"" Border Force officers have reported that ""access to small craft was getting easier and cheaper, creating more opportunities for criminals to involve themselves in the facilitation of clandestine entry and smuggling,"" according to an inspection of the South Coast ports,published this month. But understanding the true scale of the issue is complicated by the department's insistence that revealing the number of so-called ""clandestine entries"" made by boat would ""prejudice the operation of immigration controls"". Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke, who described the rise in boat crossings as ""unprecedented"", said Border Force needed more resources, including investment in additional patrol boats to act as a deterrent. He said the number of migrants detected in lorries in Dover had ""plummeted"" by more than a third since the Calais Jungle was dismantled. But Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said the increase in boat crossings was a ""natural consequence of the hostile environment and tightening up the borders"". ""People are having to find ways that are more and more dangerous,"" she added. In the past 21 days, 12 groups of migrants have attempted the crossing from France to England Ashford MP and former immigration minister Damian Green said emphasis should be placed on ""actually knowing where people are coming from [and] breaking up the international criminal gangs that are actually behind this"". ""If we do need more resources, that's where they should go,"" he added. The Home Office said officials were focusing on ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"". Ms Parrot said the French were already ""strengthening measures"" to prevent attempted crossings, rather than focusing only on launching rescue operations. ""Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with,"" she said. ""On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check Fewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40. Theroutine check,externalcan pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said. The check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse. It involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74. Around 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show. NHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes. And if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia. Anyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases. You should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years. After the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse. By checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Research shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia. You will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by: improving your diet taking more exercise taking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol losing weight stopping smoking If you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for. Some people told the BBC the check had been time consuming. Anna Oxbury, from Cheltenham, said she had to go to her local hospital for the blood testing part of the check because her GP practice was unable to do it. She said: ""I'm self-employed and reckon the 'free' health check, which meant three separate visits to practice and hospital, cost me over Â£100 in lost work time. ""My husband has an important job and could only make time for the check if he took a half-day holiday. That's why he won't do it."" However, David, from Hampshire, said the check ""probably saved his life"". A letter for the appointment went out to him in October after he turned 50.

"Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check Fewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40. Theroutine check,externalcan pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said. The check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse. It involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74. Around 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show. NHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes. And if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia. Anyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases. You should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years. After the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse. By checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Research shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia. You will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by: improving your diet taking more exercise taking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol losing weight stopping smoking If you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for. Some people told the BBC the check had been time consuming. Anna Oxbury, from Cheltenham, said she had to go to her local hospital for the blood testing part of the check because her GP practice was unable to do it. She said: ""I'm self-employed and reckon the 'free' health check, which meant three separate visits to practice and hospital, cost me over Â£100 in lost work time. ""My husband has an important job and could only make time for the check if he took a half-day holiday. That's why he won't do it."" However, David, from Hampshire, said the check ""probably saved his life"". A letter for the appointment went out to him in October after he turned 50. The blood test revealed he had developed diabetes - thought to be the type-2 version of the condition - and his GP was concerned enough about the results to send him to the hospital for further tests.

"Jackie Chan (L) starred in the film Shinjuku Incident alongside Daniel Wu (R) Iran's state broadcaster, Irib, has sacked the head of a regional TV channel after it broadcast a Jackie Chan film without removing a sex scene. A video posted online apparently by a viewer on Kish Island showed the Hong Kong martial arts star having sex with a woman in the film Shinjuku Incident. Iranian media said the ""immoral"" scene was aired by Kish TV in ""total violation of Irib's regulations"". Physical contact between men and women is not permitted on screen in Iran.

"This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 More than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks. Why? On 23 November, shortly before sunrise, eight migrants were foundclinging to a dinghy in choppy watersoff the coast of Kent. They told their rescuers they had spent 12 hours at sea. It was a similar story the day before, when seven more were found in a boat just off the Dover coast - the same number of people had been pulled from an inflatable boat just a few hours earlier. Since 3 November, 101 migrants - including four children - have attempted the 21-mile journey across the Channel, one whichpolice have likenedto ""trying to cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Border Force was called to Dover's marina on 22 November to deal with seven suspected migrants The Home Office has refused to publish official figures, but the BBC has established that at least that number have entered British shores since the start of the month. Without fail, the migrants have told officials they are Iranian. British and French authorities, under pressure to stem the rise in boat trips before a life is lost, face several questions. Why have so many boats set off for the coast of Kent? What can be done to stop it? And why are all the occupants apparently from the Middle Eastern country? The answer to the last question could lie 1,200 miles away in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A French helicopter joined the rescue effort on 22 November Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, believes migrants arriving in the UK are among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August last year. The move was ostensibly intended to increase tourism and trade between Iran, the world's 25th largest economy, and Serbia, the 90th. The visa scheme - which attracted allegations it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe - ended on 17 October, by which time some 40,000 Iranians were said to have flown to the Balkan nation. It is unknown how many returned home, but according to the Associated Press, local media reported that direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade had been arriving full and returning empty. BBC reporter Simon Jones tweeted a picture of this boat after one rescue near Dover According to Info Park, a refugee support centre in Belgrade, Serbian police estimate the number of Iranians who failed to return at 12,000. Mr ÄakiÄ said it was believed within the refugee community that Iranians were using ""false passports and more complex methods"" to enter western Europe. They arrived better prepared for the journey ahead and would stay in hostels or hotels. Most refugees in Serbia slept in squats, while Iranians reportedly stayed in hotels Meanwhile, refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, travelled thousands of kilometres on foot and ended up living on the streets or in derelict buildings across Belgrade. Compared to fellow migrants, the Iranians looked ""more like tourists... they were kids in hoodies and jeans, with backpacks"", said Gordan Paunovic, of Info Park. ""Many of [the Iranians] were travelling with fake passports, which were costing between 3,000 to 6,000 euros in Istanbul. ""They didn't share the normal fate of refugees and migrants who have a very hard time in the Balkans. They would not be forced to sleep rough or go to refugee centres like the other people. ""They were here for a month, staying in hotels, and would find a smuggler to make other arrangements."" Iranians were said not to have shared ""the normal fate"" of migrants in the Balkans Iranians may be set apart from fellow migrants by their economic prosperity, yet for many living under the repressive regime, life is far from easy. Kaveh Kalantri, of the Iranian Association, which supports refugees in the UK, said a lack of freedom and human rights violations were driving some Iranians out. ""People get arrested if they have liberal or left-wing views, or if they are from religious minorities. A lot of people experience violence on a daily basis."" Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 Iranians have left the country every year. In the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality, according to Home Office figures. In 2017, they accounted for 9% of the 26,350 applications. ""Iranians coming to the UK is not unusual, but the way they are coming is,"" Mr Kalantri said. Tens of thousands of Iranians are said to have flown into Belgrade One theory as to why Iranians are choosing to risk their lives on boats stems from their comparative wealth - simply put, they can afford to pay smuggling gangs to get them onboard a vessel. Maya Konforti, of L'Auberge des Migrants, a refugee support group in Calais, described the attempted crossings as ""the speciality of Iranians"". ""Crossing by boat can only be done by people who have some money. Africans don't have any left by the time they arrive in Calais,"" she said. ""There is a new influx of Iranians arriving in Calais. They seem to be the only ones who both dare to do it and find the means to do so."" The Calais Jungle was dismantled in 2016, but migrants from across Africa and the Middle East continue to live in camps Mr ÄakiÄ suggested Iranians heading for Kent had entered the EU via Serbia. ""I don't see any other explanation. Serbia was the only country on the Balkan Route that had a significant number of Iranians."" Not everyone believes all the migrants are Iranian. Prof Adib-Moghaddam, from the Centre for Iranian Studies at SOAS University of London, suspects most of them are of Afghan origin. However, immigration specialist Emma Nawaz said she ""could not see what benefit they would achieve by falsely saying that they are Iranian"". Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Which industries employ European workers? How has EU migration changed the UK? Regardless, the ""surge"" in attempts is being fuelled by ""organised criminal and mafia networks"" in France, according to Ingrid Parrot, who works for the Maritime prefecture - the Border Force equivalent based in Cherbourg. She said there had been 30 attempted crossings in 2018, 12 in 2017, and 23 the year before. The majority failed because the vessels were too small - mostly canoes, dinghies and ""makeshift"" boats - but several attempts in 2018 have been made in pleasure crafts and speedboats, which have seen a spike in thefts. Ingrid Parrot says ""our fear is having bodies on the beaches"" Border Force officers have reported that ""access to small craft was getting easier and cheaper, creating more opportunities for criminals to involve themselves in the facilitation of clandestine entry and smuggling,"" according to an inspection of the South Coast ports,published this month. But understanding the true scale of the issue is complicated by the department's insistence that revealing the number of so-called ""clandestine entries"" made by boat would ""prejudice the operation of immigration controls"". Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke, who described the rise in boat crossings as ""unprecedented"", said Border Force needed more resources, including investment in additional patrol boats to act as a deterrent. He said the number of migrants detected in lorries in Dover had ""plummeted"" by more than a third since the Calais Jungle was dismantled. But Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said the increase in boat crossings was a ""natural consequence of the hostile environment and tightening up the borders"". ""People are having to find ways that are more and more dangerous,"" she added. In the past 21 days, 12 groups of migrants have attempted the crossing from France to England Ashford MP and former immigration minister Damian Green said emphasis should be placed on ""actually knowing where people are coming from [and] breaking up the international criminal gangs that are actually behind this"". ""If we do need more resources, that's where they should go,"" he added. The Home Office said officials were focusing on ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"". Ms Parrot said the French were already ""strengthening measures"" to prevent attempted crossings, rather than focusing only on launching rescue operations. ""Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with,"" she said. ""On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"There has been a wave of criticism after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said he sexually assaulted a maid when he was a teenager. In a speech, he recalled confessing to a priest how he reached into the maid's underwear as she slept. Women's rights group Gabriela said Mr Duterte was ""unworthy of his position and should resign"". The Philippines president has sparked outrage with a number of provocative comments but remains popular. In his latest remarks, he described entering the room of his maid while she was sleeping. ""I lifted the blanket... I tried to touch what was inside the panty,"" he said. ""I was touching. She woke up so I left the room."" He said he told the priest that he later returned to the woman's room and tried to molest her again. Mr Duterte said the priest told him to say ""five Our Fathers, five Hail Mary's, because you will go to hell"",,externalaccording to news website Rappler. It is common for well-off families in the Philippines to employ maids and many women also work as domestic helpers across Asia and the Middle East. Mr Duterte's spokesman has since said that the president had merely ""made up"" and ""added and spliced"" the story during his speech on Saturday. Outrage as Duterte kisses worker on stage Philippines' Duterte calls God 'stupid' Filipino leader says he killed as a teen Rights groups in the Philippines have strongly condemned the comments, which were made as part of a tirade against the Catholic Church over the sexual abuse of children. This video can not be played âRape jokes are not OK,â feminist punks tell Duterte Gabriela, a political party representing women's rights groups, said the comments were tantamount to admitting rape. ""Rape does not happen only through penile insertion,"" the organisation's secretary general Joms Salvador said. ""If it is a finger or an object it is considered rape."" The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific warned that the president's comments put domestic workers at risk. ""Flaunting abusive practices encourages the rape culture and in this case, sexual abuse of domestic workers,"" said executive director Jean Enriquez. More than one million Filipinos work overseas as domestic workers, according to government figures. Mr Duterte has been a fierce critic of the Catholic Church, which has criticised his bloody drug war that seen thousands of people killed. The Philippines president has drawn fire for previous actions and comments about women. Earlier this year, he sparked criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. This video can not be played Mr Duterte has sparked controversy before He also told Filipino soldiers they should shoot female communist rebels in the vagina. In April 2016, he spoke to an election campaign rally about the 1989 murder and rape of a female Australian missionary in Davao, where he was mayor at the time. ""I was angry because she was raped,"" he said. ""That's one thing. But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first, what a waste."" His office later apologised.

"New EU rules on fishing quotas could have a ""grave"" impact on the UK's fishing industry, a House of Lords committee has said - just a day before the new policy is introduced. Under previous rules, crews often discarded, into the sea, fish that took them over their quota for that species. But under the new policy, fishers must bring the full haul back to shore. This change is to stop fish being wasted. The legislation has been called ""badly designed"" by UK industry bodies. The House of Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee heard evidence that the legislation could mean fishermen hitting their annual quotas much earlier in the year and have to stop fishing. Discards on the Brussels fish menu UK 'to keep more of its fish' after Brexit The committee was told this would be particularly problematic in ""mixed fisheries"" where it would be hard for boats to avoid catching a fish species for which they have a very low quota. Once they reached their quota for a particular species, fishers would be forced to choose between halting operations for the rest of the year or breaking the law by continuing to fish for other species and discarding anything over quota. There are fears that enforcement agencies do not have the capability to police the new rules The committee also said it had worries about how the rules - which come into effect in full after a four-year phasing-in period - would be enforced. It said patrol vessels would only be able to cover a small percentage of boats, creating a temptation for fishers to break the rules. Committee member Lord Krebs said: ""It is deeply concerning that so many people - fishers, environmental groups, even the enforcement agencies themselves - do not think these new rules can be implemented from January 1."" He added: ""Most people we spoke to thought nothing would change - fishers will continue to discard, knowing the chances of being caught are slim to none and that to comply with the law could bankrupt them."" Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said the rules were ""badly designed"" and would result in boats having to stop fishing for long stretches after reaching quotas on specific species. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was working with the industry to address the challenges posed by the new sustainable fishing policy. The committee is due to publish its report on the implementation and enforcement of the EU ""landing obligation"" in February.

"Traffic has reopened after the road was closed this morning A main route between England and Wales was closed after a man climbed a bridge and flew a drone from the top. Traffic was stopped on the M48 - the older of two Severn crossings - because of ""concern for welfare,"" police said. The man, in his 20s, came down voluntarily from the 47m (154ft) bridge tower and was arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance.

"Russia's FSB state security agency says it has arrested a US citizen ""caught spying"" in Moscow. It named him as Paul Whelan, saying he was arrested in Moscow on 28 December and charged with ""espionage"". The FSB gave no further details. The US state department says it has requested consular access for the man held in Moscow, Reuters news agency reports. The US has not confirmed his name, but says it has been officially notified about the arrest. If found guilty, he faces between 10 and 20 years in jail, Russia's Tass news agency reports. Spying accusations have been a persistent feature of Russia's relations with the US and UK this year. Associates of President Donald Trump are under investigation in connection with Robert Mueller's special counsel inquiry into possible Russian ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Earlier this month a Russian gun rights activist held in the US, Maria Butina, pleaded guilty to conspiracy.US prosecutors say she acted as a Russian state agent, infiltrating conservative political groups. In March the UK and its Western alliesexpelled more than 100 Russian diplomats, in response to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.

"This video can not be played Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule. The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements. At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body. The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT. It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data. Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday. Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby ""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence. ""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away."" Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out. ""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters. The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima. With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components. New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment. Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth. But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home. The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second. This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images. Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima. ""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing."" Children invited to mission control celebrate the moment of closest approach When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface. Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May. The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images. ""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in."" Allow Twitter content?

"Blue badge holders can park for free in pay and display bays and for up to three hours on yellow lines A disability charity says it is ""disgraceful"" councils are failing to take action against people misusing blue-badge parking permits. Analysis by the Press Association found 94 out of 152 (62%) local authorities in England did not pursue anyone for abusing the scheme in 2017-18. Phil Talbot, from charity Scope, said thefts of disabled permits were rising. The Local Government Association said councils had to take ""tough decisions"" on enforcement with limited resources. Mr Talbot added: ""Stealing blue badges isn't a crime without consequences. They are a vital lifeline for those who genuinely need them."" The analysis of the Department of Transport data showed the number of blue badges reported stolen totalled 4,246. It found 31 councils did not catch anyone despite claiming to have a policy for prosecuting offenders. Local authorities in Nottingham, Middlesbrough, Shropshire, Luton, Milton Keynes, Bournemouth and Reading were among those to record zero prosecutions. Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, said gathering evidence and mounting a prosecution could be ""time-consuming and expensive"". Disabled charity Scope urged the authorities to crack down on the abuse of blue badges About 2.4 million disabled people in England haveblue badges,external, which are issued by councils. Almost every case involving the 1,215 prosecutions across the country involved drivers using someone else's blue badge. The permits allow holders to park for free in pay and display bays and for up to three hours on yellow lines, except for where there are restrictions. Blue badge holders can register for100% discount from the London congestion charge,external. The largest number of prosecutions were made by the London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham (137) and Newham (88), with Leeds (78) in third place. Mr Tett claimed the disparity in enforcement levels across England was likely to reflect ""different levels of pressures on available parking"".

"Honduras migrant Kevin Gallardo Antunez stands next to the border fence The idea of a concrete wall on the US-Mexico border was dropped early in Donald Trump's presidency, his outgoing chief of staff John Kelly says. Mr Trump made the idea of a solid wall on the border a key pledge from the start of his presidential campaign in 2015. But by saying the idea of a concrete wall was dismissed long ago, Mr Kelly appeared to contradict the president. Mr Trump has tweeted the term ""wall"" 59 times this month alone. Mr Kelly will leave the White House on Wednesday after 17 months. Before leaving, he gave a rare interview to the LA Times, published on Sunday, in which he called the role a ""bone-crushing hard job"". ""To be honest, it's not a wall,""Mr Kelly said, when asked about plans for the border.,external The former Marine Corps general was initially appointed as Mr Trump's homeland security secretary before becoming chief of staff in July 2017. As soon as he did so, he told the LA Times, he sought advice from those who ""actually secure the border"". Has Trump kept his campaign promises? Six things that could topple the wall ""They said, 'Well, we need a physical barrier in certain places, we need technology across the board, and we need more people,'"" he said. ""The president still says 'wall' - oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it."" ""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall."" These were the words Mr Trump spoke on 16 June 2015 as he launched his presidential campaign. At the same time, he said Mexican ""rapists"" and drug dealers were entering the US. In the early months of his campaign, he attacked rival Jeb Bush for calling his proposal a ""fence"".

This video can not be played How will President Trump deliver on border wall promise? Mr Trump is struggling to get the funding needed to start building the wall. Because Congress was not able to agree a funding deal that included the financing of the wall, the US government went into a partial shutdown before Christmas that has still not been resolved. Mr Trump has since threatened to shut down the border with Mexicoif funding for the wall is not approved. But with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, the chances of a deal being struck are likely to become even more distant. The difficulty in getting approval for the wall has created disapproval among some Trump loyalists. Right-wing columnist Ann Coulter - author of In Trump We Trust - recently predicted he will not be re-elected. ""Without a wall, he will only be remembered as a small cartoon figure who briefly inflamed and amused the rabble,"" she wrote. Has Trump delivered on his promises? Trump's prototype walls.

"Eyewitnesses reported seeing about 50 police officers at the scene in Hammersmith Thirty-nine people at a house party were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in west London. The man, thought to be in his mid-30s, was found with life-threatening wounds when police were called to Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, at 01:00 GMT. The Metropolitan Police said the victim was chased by men and women following ""a minor argument"" in a shop. The arrested people have since been released from custody, officers said. The suspects were seen going into a property where there was a party. Officers tried to speak to those in the flat, but when they failed to co-operate 39 people were arrested. One witness said the group were ""lined up and interrogated"" for about an hour in the street. The injured man was treated at the scene by officers and paramedics. He is critically ill in hospital. London's year of deadly violence The city curing violence like a disease London violence 'to take 10 years to solve' Supt Mark Lawrence said: ""Whilst it is unusual for so many people to be arrested in the early stages of an investigation such as this, due to a lack of co-operation and the necessity of securing essential evidence following a serious assault this action was appropriate."" A tattoo parlour, the Southern Belle pub and a Sainsbury's Local supermarket are all within a police cordon, according to BBC Radio London's Greg McKenzie who has been reporting from the scene. Blood was seen on the pavement within one of the three taped off areas. Two knives were found nearby, said police. A tattoo parlour, a pub and a supermarket are all within the cordon in west London One woman said she saw a group of people running before hearing someone shouting: ""Get him."" ""All of a sudden, all of them in a rush together ran in that door [to the flat] together,"" she added. The witness, who did not want to be identified, said she saw the victim being treated by paramedics. She indicated he had been stabbed in the chest. A neighbour of the flat in Greyhound Road, where the arrests are thought to have been made, said the party had seemed ""quite relaxed and chilled"". ""We just heard normal talking. It sounded like squealing girls like you get on a night out,"" she added. Another neighbour, Mason El Hage, 22, said: ""I have never seen something like that in my life. It was very extreme in terms of the amount of people involved,"" he said. The graphic designer said he initially thought it was a drugs raid after he heard noise and dogs barking at about 01:30 GMT. ""After that, three riot vans rocked up and about 50 police officers marched down the road, went into the house next door and brought around 30 to 40 people outside,"" he said. ""They lined them up and interrogated them for about an hour."" Mr El Hage said the group, including young men and women, were arrested in ""single file"" in a ""very, very swift operation"". Four of them, all males, have been released on bail. Everyone else in the group - 20 males and 15 females, all aged between 16 and 22 - has been released while investigations continue.

"President Trump announced the withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria A top Republican has said US President Donald Trump remains committed to defeating Islamic State (IS) in Syria, despite his plan to withdraw US troops. Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the withdrawal had been slowed and he was now reassured of the president's commitment after meeting him on Sunday. Mr Trump's troop pullout plan met strong criticism from major allies, and senior Republicans like Mr Graham. The White House has yet to comment on Mr Graham's remarks. ""I think we're in a pause situation where we are re-evaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective of having people pay more and do more,"" Mr. Graham said. He did not explain this, butThe New York Times reports,externalthat he may be referring to assurances given to military officials that they can have longer than 30 days to ensure an orderly withdrawal of troops. On 19 December,Mr Trump announced the pullout of some 2,000 troops, asserting that IS had been defeated. Critics of the plan dispute this claim, arguingthe move could lead to a resurgence of ISwhich would hurt national security. US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two people have resigned since the decision was announced- Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and a top US official in the fight against IS, Brett McGurk. Trump rewrites US-Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Why the battle for northern Syria matters Lindsey Graham, who had earlier called the withdrawal decision a ""huge Obama-like mistake"", told journalists: ""The president assured me he is going to make sure he gets the job done. Mr Trump heard how IS is not ""completely destroyed"" during a Christmas visit to troops in Iraq, Mr Graham said ""He promised to destroy Isis. He's going to keep that promise. ""I think we're slowing things down in a smart way,"" the South Carolina senator said. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus suggests thatMr Trump appears to be washing his hands of Syriaand handing the whole job over to Russia, Turkey and Iran. Speaking later on CNN, Mr Graham also expressed concern that the US withdrawal would leave ""our allies the Kurds"" in the north of Syria exposed to attacks from Turkey. ""If we leave now, the Kurds are going to get slaughtered,"" he said. ""The president is reconsidering how we do this. He's frustrated, I get that."" US ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS. The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos. Over the intervening years the numbers of US troops in Syria increased, standing today at some 2,000, though some estimates place the number perhaps even higher. A network of bases and airstrips has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country. The US has also been part of an international coalition conducting air strikes against IS and other militants. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State?

"This video can not be played There were violent scenes outside polling stations Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has secured her third consecutive term with a landslide victory in Bangladesh's national election. Her party and its allies won almost all of the 300 parliamentary seats contested, in its best ever result. But the opposition alliance, which won just seven seats, condemned the vote as ""farcical"", marred by violence, intimidation and vote rigging claims. Election authorities said there could be no re-run. Although the election commission earlier said it had heard vote-rigging allegations from ""across the country"" and would investigate, the commissioner said voting had been held in a peaceful manner and hence there would be no new vote. Bangladesh's parliament has 350 seats in total, 50 of which are reserved for women and allotted proportional to the overall vote. ""We urge the election commission to void this farcical result immediately,"" opposition leader Kamal Hossain said on Sunday. ""We are demanding that a fresh election is held under a neutral government as early as possible."" Bangladesh grows tired of its battling leading ladies More on life in Bangladesh At least 17 people have been killed in clashes between ruling party supporters and the opposition. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009 and won 288 seats in this election. But one of the leading opposition parties has accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. A spokesman for the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) alleged there were ""irregularities"" in 221 of the 300 seats being contested. Soon before polls opened, a BBC correspondent saw filled ballot boxes at a polling centre in the port city of Chittagong. The presiding officer declined to comment. Only ruling party polling agents were present at that and several other polling centres in the second-largest city of the country. Voters queue in the capital, Dhaka Human Rights Watch South Asia directorMeenakshi Ganguly said on Twitter,externalthat ""with serious allegations of voter intimidation, restrictions on opposition polling agents and several candidates seeking a re-poll, there are concerns about the credibility"" of the election. At least 47 candidates from the main opposition alliance withdrew before polling closed, alleging vote rigging and intimidation. Bangladesh clothing factories: Are they safe now? Climate and miscarriage in Bangladesh Activists, observers and the opposition party had warned that the vote would not be fair, but the governing party accused the opposition of peddling false claims. Ms Hasina told the BBC on Friday: ""On the one hand, they are placing allegations. On the other hand, they are attacking our party workers, leaders. That is the tragedy in this country."" At polling booths on Sunday, the BBC's Yogita Limaye found that Ms Hasina's supporters were vocal and happy to answer questions on camera, while other voters were mostly too scared to speak out. Dozens of workers from the PM's party were outside polling stations, while no-one from opposition parties was visible. One man said that several members of his extended family found that their votes had already been cast when they went to the polling booth. Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million people and faces issues ranging from possibly devastating climate change,Islamist militancy, endemic poverty and corruption. The country has recently been in the international spotlight ashundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled there from neighbouring Myanmar. PM Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, casts her ballot on Sunday The lead-up to the election saw violence between rival supporters and a crackdown on dissent by a government that critics say has only grown more authoritarian during its 10 years in power. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League (AL) is however credited with overseeing rapid economic growth and social development, especially in rural areas. Bangladesh has emerged as the world's second-largest garment exporter, after China. Sheikh Hasina's long-term rival, Khaleda Zia, was sent to prison on corruption charges earlier this year and barred from competing in the vote, in a case which she claimed was politically motivated. In Ms Zia's absence, Kamal Hossain, who was previously both an AL minister and Hasina ally, leads the main opposition grouping, the Jatiya Oikya Front, which includes Ms Zia's Bangladesh National Party (BNP). However, the 81-year-old lawyer, who drew up the country's constitution, did not stand in the election. The BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014, making Sunday's poll the first to involve all the major parties in 10 years.

"This video can not be played Where is Ultima Thule? BBC Science Editor David Shukman explains The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule. The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements. At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body. The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT. It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data. Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday. Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015. It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. Ultima appears elongated: One of the last pictures returned to Earth before the flyby ""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence. ""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away."" Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out. ""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters. The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima. With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components. New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment. Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth. But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home. The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second. This video can not be played Brian May: ""I want to merge the science with the music to contribute to the whole experience"" New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images. Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima. ""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing."" Children invited to mission control celebrate the moment of closest approach When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface. Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May. The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images. ""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in."" Allow Twitter content?

"Police and Border Force officers where the boat landed on a Kent beach The issue of increasing numbers of migrants trying to cross the Channel in small boats to reach the UK has ""no easy answers"", the home secretary says. Sajid Javid is chairing talks in London later after agreeing a joint action plan with the French interior minister. On Monday morning, Border Force officers were calledto Greatstone, Kent, after a group of 12 migrants were spotted. Since November, a total of 239 people have reached the UK by boat. Mr Javid has come under growing pressure to act, and has returned from a family holiday in South Africa to address the issue. Following a call with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, the pair agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" to be put in place in the coming week. It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? UK and France to step up Channel patrols Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit' The Home Office did not give information on how this would be done. Some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - have criticised a lack of detail, as well as calling for more Border Force patrol boats to be deployed. Mr Javid said the complex factors behind the rise in numbers of people attempting the Channel crossing included instability in the Middle East, organised crime and tighter security at Calais. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalhe said: ""The reasons behind the increased crossings are complicated and in many cases outside of our control."" ""Unfortunately, this means that there are no easy answers,"" he wrote. ""So our response is focused both here in the UK and abroad."" This video can not be played The dinghy appeared to be taking in water as it approached the coast A meeting between Mr Javid, the Border Force, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Whitehall officials and other agencies was held on Monday to discuss what further action could be taken. ""While we have obligations to genuine asylum seekers... we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our global society,"" he added. Of those making the crossing, six men were found on a beach in Kent on Sunday Currently, only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. The prime minister's spokeswoman said the Border Force had increased the number of ""smaller and more agile"" coastal patrol boats deployed across the south-east coast in recent months. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke has repeated calls for Border Force cutters to be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol the Channel. The Home Office has not said whether any of them would return. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed. Mr Elphicke welcomed the cooperation between France and the UK but said ""it falls short of the kind of joint action and operations needed on the English Channel - specifically for the immediate return to France of people making illegal crossings"". Six more Iranian menwere found on a beach near Dover on Sunday morning. The NCA said French authorities prevented a further attempt to cross the Channel on Saturday night.

Pierre-Henri Dumont, MP for Calais, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme smugglers were using ""the uncertainty of Brexit"" to ""spread fake news"" to migrants, telling them that this was the best time to attempt the crossing. He also called for closer co-operation between France and the UK to ""dismantle smugglers' associations"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Loinger received France's top award, the Legion d'Honneur, in 2005 French resistance fighter Georges Loinger, whose bravery and invention saved hundreds of Jewish children in World War Two, has died aged 108. His death was announced by France's Holocaust Memorial Foundation.,external Born in Strasbourg to a Jewish family, he was captured by the Nazis in 1940 but escaped. One of the methods he used to save children was to take them to the Swiss border, then kick a football over the frontier and get them to chase it. ""I spotted a football pitch that was on the border. It was made up of fences two-and-a-half metres high. I saw that there was nobody,"" he said. ""I made the children play, I told some of them to lift up the fences and I passed the ball."" Parents who saved their only child by giving her away The Holocaust year by year Loinger was serving in the French army when he was caught in 1940 but his blond hair and blue eyes apparently concealed the fact he was Jewish from his German captors and this enabled his escape from a prisoner of war camp. Returning to France during the war he joined an aid agency trying to help Jewish children whose parents had been killed or sent to concentration camps. Another method he used involved dressing children as mourners and taking them to a cemetery on the French-Swiss border, where they would climb up a gravedigger's ladder to neutral territory. He is thought to have saved more than 350 children. Loinger's cousin was another French resistance fighter,the mime artist Marcel Marceau.,external Child saved by being given away France's Jewish deportation documented New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Tuyen Nguyen stuck out his arm as a berth for Clark The eagle has landed - not once, but twice. Two American football fans got the surprise of their lives on Saturday when a North American bald eagle went rogue at a college football game in Texas, and decided to perch in the crowd. The sizeable bird, which goes by the name of Clark, was apparently meant to fly around the stadium during the national anthem, before a 90,000-strong crowd watched the Cotton Bowl, the college football playoff semi-final between Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Clemson Tigers. But instead of landing near his handler, he made straight for Notre Dame fan Albert Armas. Mr Armas, 42, later admitted he was scared when the huge bird took hold of his shoulder. His 13-year-old son Jaysen, who got tickets to the game for Christmas, spent 20 joyful seconds chuckling at his dad's expense. Notre Dame fan Albert Armas was seen flinching as his unexpected visitor spread his wings Pictures and footage from the AT&T Stadium in Arlington show fellow fans cheering and whipping out their phones to capture the unusual moment. Clark wasn't content with visiting one spectator, however - and a second Notre Dame fan, Tuyen Nguyen, was delighted to lend an arm. WATCH: A fruity guide to American football Is college football to blame for NFL woes? He told Sports Illustrated: ""When I saw the bird land [on Armas], I thought the bird had to be very tired. So I put my hand out to see what happens. And it landed on me. It was very interesting. I was very excited. It was amazing, I couldn't even believe it."" Spare a thought for his wife Kim, though - she had gone to the toilet and missed the whole thing. Kimberley Martin, a senior NFL writer for Yahoo Sports, shared the scene on Twitter, where some called it a good omen for Notre Dame. Allow Twitter content?

"Moroccans have held vigils for the two murdered Scandinavian women A dual Swiss-Spanish national has been arrested in Morocco for alleged involvement in the killings of two Scandinavian tourists. The man, who has not been named, was detained in Marrakesh for allegedly trying to recruit Moroccans ""to carry out terrorist plots"", a statement said. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were murdered in December. Their bodies were found in the High Atlas mountains near a tourist spot. Norwegian police have saida video appearing to show one of the tourists being beheaded was likely to be real. Tourist murders suspects 'backed IS' Morocco's Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said on Saturday the Swiss-Spanish national was suspected of ""teaching some of those arrested... about communication tools involving new technology and of training them in marksmanship"". The Swiss-Spanish national followed an ""extremist ideology"", the statement said. Police said four main suspects in the killings had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, although investigators believe there was no contact with groups in Syria or Iraq. Hundreds across Morocco have attended vigils for the two women. Many participants came with signs saying ""sorry"" In the capital Rabat a minute's silence was held with Danish and Norwegian diplomats present, while hundreds more people attended a vigil in the southern village of Imlil, near where the women's bodies were found. Flowers were also laid in the city of Marrakesh. Ms Jespersen, who was 24 and from Denmark, and 28-year-old Norwegian Ms Ueland had been studying outdoor activities at the University of Southeastern Norway. They had arrived on a month-long holiday in Morocco on 9 December and had travelled to the foothills of Mount Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak, 10km (6 miles) from Imlil. Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found dead in a popular tourist area Their bodies were found in their tent. Both women had taken full precautions ahead of their trip, Maren Ueland's mother said.

"Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check Fewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40. Theroutine check,externalcan pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said. The check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse. It involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74. Around 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show. NHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes. And if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia. Anyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases. You should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years. After the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse. By checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Research shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia. You will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by: improving your diet taking more exercise taking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol losing weight stopping smoking If you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for. Some people told the BBC the check had been time consuming. Anna Oxbury, from Cheltenham, said she had to go to her local hospital for the blood testing part of the check because her GP practice was unable to do it. She said: ""I'm self-employed and reckon the 'free' health check, which meant three separate visits to practice and hospital, cost me over Â£100 in lost work time. ""My husband has an important job and could only make time for the check if he took a half-day holiday. That's why he won't do it."" However, David, from Hampshire, said the check ""probably saved his life"". A letter for the appointment went out to him in October after he turned 50. The blood test revealed he had developed diabetes - thought to be the type-2 version of the condition - and his GP was concerned enough about the results to send him to the hospital for further tests. There they found he was severely dehydrated and had to give him three and a half litres of saline to rehydrate him. ""That routine test probably saved my life,"" he said. Alistair Burns, national clinical director for dementia and older people's mental health for NHS England, said: ""Heart disease and dementia are two of the biggest health risks facing people in our country. ""Attending a free NHS health check is a great opportunity to discuss existing health conditions, and to work out how to reduce the risk of developing dementia and other illness in the future."" He said the start of a new year was the right time to commit to ""taking a simple, free and potentially life-saving step towards a healthier life"". Public Health England said the check looked at the top causes of premature death and ill health and supported people to take action to reduce their risks. What is an NHS Health Check?
