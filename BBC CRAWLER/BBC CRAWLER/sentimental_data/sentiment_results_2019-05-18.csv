"Samuel Abdulraheem has no recollection of the day he was abducted, aged seven, from his family home in the northern Nigerian city of Kano. Although he came from a large family - his father had 17 children by four wives - Samuel was on his own with a nanny that day. His family were told he had gone outside to ride his bicycle. They would not see him again for another six years. ""There is nothing we didn't do to try to find him,"" his older sister Firdausi Okezie recalls. Then aged 21, she was not made aware of his disappearance at first. Her brother had always enjoyed rushing to answer the phone and speak with her when she called home from university. But when other members of the household began answering it when she rang, she suspected something was wrong. After her classes one afternoon, Firdausi travelled home unexpectedly and her father, an architect and hotelier, was forced to reveal the heart-breaking truth: Her favourite sibling had been missing for more than a month. At first Samuel's mother, pictured here a few years before the disappearance, was not told her son was missing ""At first, my father had the nanny arrested, but after investigations, they let her go,"" Firdausi says. They also tried to hide the news from Samuel's mother, who was divorced from his father, for as long as possible. Every time she called from her new home in a different city, they would conjure different excuses. Eventually, an uncle was assigned the unenviable task of telling her. In addition to extensive police investigations, the family placed adverts in newspapers and sent out search parties to comb the streets. They checked ditches in case he had been the victim of a hit and run, and even consulted Muslim spiritual priests, known as malams. In time, her father asked the family to accept that their brother was dead - they had done the best they could. Firdausi refused to give up. She dedicated her university thesis to her missing brother and a year after graduating, she moved south to Lagos in search of work. She converted to Christianity and started attending Winners Chapel - one of Nigeria's mega churches based in Ogun state just outside the city. Every December, the church holds a five-day gathering of its members from all over the world. During the event, known as Shiloh, interested members of the congregation are allocated free stands to display their goods and services within the church premises. Still without a job in December 2000, Firdausi applied for a stand to sell some tie-dye fabrics her mother had made. While waiting for a carpenter to help set up the display, she sat on a chair and placed her head in her lap for some rest. That was when she heard a beggar appealing, in the name of Allah, for spare change. Firdausi looked up. This beggar had his hand firmly planted on the left shoulder of a boy who was dressed in a tattered brown tunic and undersized trousers. Firdausi screamed - the haggard boy guiding the beggar was her lost brother. Samuel, now aged 30, cannot recall exactly how he was stolen from his family: ""All I remember is the train journey."" He was taken to a one-armed woman who lived on the outskirts of Lagos in an area mostly occupied by disabled beggars. The woman hired him out to blind beggars for 500 naira (approximately $5 or Â£2.50 at the time) per day. The sight of blind men and women being led around by boys and girls is common on many streets in Nigeria - especially in dense traffic where they usually tap on car windows, or around churches and mosques. Only Samuel lived with the woman, sleeping on a mat in her shack. Over the years, he says about five others boys turned up to live with other women in the same yard, each hired out to blind beggars. Samuel suspects that something must have been done or given to him during that time because he does not recall ever thinking of his family during that period, or wondering what had become of them. ""I am not sure I had emotions then,"" he says. ""Just a zombie that knew he had to wake up and lead a beggar out. Make money, eat food and sleep, and the same routine the next day. Different beggars hired him for a period of anything from a week to a month. At the end of each day, Samuel and the beggar slept alongside others in various public spaces. If a beggar enjoyed working with him, they hired him again for another period. ""I was like a slave,"" he says. ""I couldn't say I wanted to go and do anything. I had to be around always."" As he was always on the move, Samuel made few friends, only occasionally playing with the children of other beggars he bumped into in the evenings. Sometimes people gave them food while they were out begging. At other times they hung around restaurants and ate the leftovers or scavenged in dustbins. ""I was always hungry. During the daytime when you work, you hardly sit down to eat,"" he recalls. ""I didn't feel the beggars were bad. They wake up, beg, the way people wake up and go to work."" Day after day, Samuel walked from one end of Lagos to the other with a beggar's right hand gripping his shoulder. Sometimes, they trekked to neighbouring states or across the border to Benin. If the beggars received news of potential benefactors gathered somewhere, they told Samuel and he took them there by bus. ""There were times when you get so tired and you start bypassing people, but blind people are very sensitive - their hearing - so they pick up sound. Sometimes they would twist your shoulder and say: 'There is someone there. Why are you moving away?' ""They try to make as much money as they can."" In December 2000, a beggar he was guiding heard news of the programme at Winners Chapel where they ran into his sister. At first, Firdausi was too shocked to reach out and touch her brother - who can still recall her scream. ""I fell down on the floor,"" she says. Samuel looked gaunt, his right shoulder was significantly tilted and he appeared dumb, not speaking a word. The sight caused Firdausi to burst into tears. ""It took a while but I knew that she was someone I knew - that this person was someone related to me,"" Samuel says. David Oyedepo, founder of the Winners Chapel, held Samuel and prayed for him Soon a crowd gathered and drawn by the commotion, church officials also arrived. They managed to make sense of Firdausi's barely coherent joy and decreed that it was a ""miracle"" worth sharing with the entire congregation. They ferried Samuel to a corner and gave him a quick wash. They found him fresh clothes to wear and rushed them both to the stage of the 50,000-seat auditorium where Firdausi was given a microphone. In tears, she narrated how she had just found her brother who had been missing for six years. Firdausi recalls how the entire congregation leapt out of their chairs in shouts of praise and thanksgiving. The founder of the church, David Oyedepo, then held Samuel and prayed for him. Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power 'Landlords make single women feel like prostitutes' Nigeria in nine maps and charts That night they slept on the church premises in a car, as it was a long way to get back to where Firdausi lived. She remembers waking up throughout the night and touching her brother to make sure he was real. Today Firdausi says that she regrets being so engrossed in finding her brother that she did not try to rescue the others from where he was kept. Shortly before his rescue, a new young child had arrived in the yard, Samuel says. At first, the boy wept non-stop and refused to eat. Suddenly, he became silent, leading Samuel to suspect that something had been done or given to the boy to quieten him. Samuel pictured with his sister on the day of her wedding, about two years after she found him ""In a developed country, you would just go and tell the police. But, here, the police would ask you to give them money for fuel and all that, and I didn't even have a job,"" Firdausi says. Besides, reintegrating her 13-year-old brother into normal life was proving more difficult than she had imagined. He had not returned to live with his father and she was taking care of him. Boils and rashes had broken out all over his body, giving off a foul stench. His right shoulder remained bent for more than a year, requiring X-rays and physiotherapy before it finally stopped showing signs of the pressure from years of being gripped by beggars. Their mother did not recognise the youngest of her seven children - who was now rough and haggard. She had to raise his arm and search for a birthmark before she finally believed that the person in front of her was actually her son. After six years of no formal education, Samuel was barely literate. Firdausi was left frustrated with the search for a school - with many saying he was too old to join at primary level. Just when she had almost lost hope, Firdausi met a school proprietor who had seen them on the stage at the church. The woman agreed to admit him, while Firdausi made arrangements for additional private classes. Samuel Abdulraheem excelled at his studies In three months, Samuel zoomed from primary one to primary four. Within a year, he had passed the entrance exams to secondary school. Samuel spent only three years in secondary school when, aged 17, he felt confident enough to sit for university entrance exams. He passed with flying colours, attaining the best result in his entire school, and gained admission to study chemical engineering at the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. But Samuel's academic prowess would eventually lead to the sudden end to his studies. Other students often sought his assistance with assignments and he was expelled during his fourth year after being caught writing another student's answers during exams. Samuel now works as a supervisor on construction sites. ""Someday when I am comfortable financially, I hope to continue my education,"" he says, adding that computer science might be an option as he is good with gadgets. Samuel holds no ill feelings about what he went through while in captivity. He believes that all those years shaped him and taught him to try to always be nice to people. ""Nothing that people do actually gets to me. I just see it as a way of life. I don't hold grudges,"" he says. Memories of the constant hunger have affected the way he relates to beggars and their guides today. He never gives them money. ""I'd rather buy them food. Because, back then, it was better giving me food than money because the money went to the beggar and none came to me."" Samuel hopes that, by sharing his story, people will pay more attention to beggars and the children who often guide them. ""When they see a beggar with someone, they should have a second thought that, possibly, this child could need help,"" he says. ""Don't just see and give money and walk away.""

She said the operation had gone well, that the tumour was benign and that most of it had been removed, but a ""little bit"" of the tumour which was growing close to one of the main cerebral veins had to be left because the risk from removing it was too great.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Varanasi seat is up for grabs as Indians vote in the last phase of the general election. Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress party are battling it out with powerful regional rivals in what analysts believe will be a close fight. Many see this election as a referendum on Mr Modi who won a landslide in 2014. Results will be announced on 23 May, drawing to an end six weeks of voting and a long, bruising campaign. Sunday's voting will take place in 59 seats, including Mr Modi's constituency Varanasi, a holy Hindu city in the bellwether northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, belong to the fourth generation of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty The BJP is hoping to repeat its 2014 performance when it won 282 seats, the biggest victory by any party in 30 years. The Congress, which won just 44, suffered its worst defeat. A party needs at last 272 seats to claim a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election Modi: The man who wants 900m votes Can Rahul Gandhi unseat PM Modi? 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Mr Modi, with his tough image, remains the BJP's main vote-getter and is expected to hold his seat, which he won by a huge margin last time. But critics say his promises of economic growth and job creation have not met expectations, and India has become more religiously polarised under his leadership. His main rival is Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is trying to win over an India weary of his family's dynastic grip on politics. But the real kingmakers are expected to be powerful regional parties - if neither of the two main parties can win an outright majority. With 900 million eligible voters, this has been the largest election the world has ever seen. The fate of more than 8,000 candidates and some 670 political parties hangs on the ballot. All eyes will be on the exit polls, which will be released by Indian media on Sunday evening after voting ends. But they have been known to be inaccurate, partly because of the size and complexity of the electorate. The economy is perhaps the biggest issue, with farming in crisis, unemployment on the rise and growing fears that India is heading for a recession. India has seen huge protests by farmers in recent years Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy has lost some of its momentum. Growth hovers around 7% and a leaked government report claimsthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. A crop glut and declining commodity prices have led to stagnant farm incomes, leaving many farmers saddled with debt. Many also see this election as a battle for India's identity and the state of its minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynchings of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. This video can not be played 'I want to teach, not wash dishes abroad' And national security is in the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting Pakistan to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of war. It's often said that whoever wins Uttar Pradesh, wins the Indian election. The state sends 80 MPs - more than any other - to parliament. In 2014 the BJP won 71 of the state's seats. But this time, a repeat performance seems far from certain. In a surprising move, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) - bitter rivals - banded together to form a so-called ""grand alliance"" against Mr Modi. Together, they are likely to win more votes in the state and chip away at the BJP's impressive 2014 seat tally. So the ruling party is hoping to make up for these losses in states such as West Bengal, where it holds just two of the 42 parliamentary seats. Here, Mr Modi and the BJP are up against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee - a contest that has produced some of the election's fiercest exchanges. Ms Banerjee has emerged as one of Mr Modi's fieriest opponents Four of India's five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala - have long eluded the BJP. Of the 91 seats from these states, the BJP holds just four. The party contests few seats in this part of the country, relying instead on alliances with regional heavyweights. If the BJP suffers heavy losses, the winning parties in these states could decide who forms the next government. Well, the BJP could retain its majority, even if it were to lose some seats and that would bring Mr Modi back for a second term. Another scenario is a hung parliament, where no party has an overall majority. In that instance regional parties - almost all of which have not allied with either the BJP or Congress - will turn kingmakers, or possibly have a tilt at securing the top job themselves. PM Narendra Modi's Tamil Nadu problem Can West Bengal's female candidates win? How sugar influences the world's biggest vote The Congress party's chances of winning a majority appear slim. In 2014, the party was routed in Uttar Pradesh - a state once its stronghold and which has returned four generations of Mr Gandhi's family. And it has failed to stitch up a pre-poll alliance in crucial states in the east or the south - a sign of its waning influence.

"Laws covering so-called revenge porn are not fit for purpose and police still need more training, experts say. Victims should receive anonymity and laws need to include threats to share images, according to Sophie Mortimer from the Revenge Porn helpline. Figures from 19 forces in England and Wales revealed police investigations have doubled in the last four years but the number of charges has fallen. The National Police Chiefs Council said forces take the crime ""very seriously"". Revenge porn - the sharing of private or sexual images or videos of a person without their consent - became an offence in England and Wales in April 2015. Similar laws were later introduced in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Love Island's Zara: Revenge porn victims need anonymity Revenge porn almost killed me Revenge porn: 'I became the lawyer I needed' What to do if you're a victim Figures from 19 of 43 police forces in England and Wales show the number of alleged cases being investigated by officers has more than doubled in the last four years - from 852 in 2015-16 to 1,853 in 2018-19. However, the figures also reveal that the number of charges dropped by 23% - from 207 to 158 - during the same period. Revenge porn is currently categorised as a ""communications crime"", meaning victims are not granted anonymity. In the last year, more than a third of victims decided not to proceed with the case. Some say it is because they are not granted anonymity, while others cited a lack of police support. Alice Ruggles died after an ex-boyfriend broke into her home in Gateshead In October 2016, Alice Ruggles, 24, was murdered by a former boyfriend who cut her throat after breaking into her home in Gateshead. After her death it emerged that her killer, Trimaan Dhillon, had threatened to share intimate images of her online as part of a campaign of stalking and harassment. Alice's mother, Dr Sue Hills, said threatening to share images should be made part of the law. She said her daughter may have sought help sooner if Dhillon had not held the threat over her. ""It causes immensely serious psychological damage - it is a crime,"" she said. Ms Mortimer, from the Revenge Porn helpline, backed her call. She added: ""We'd also like to see it made a sexual offence because that would guarantee anonymity for victims."" Sophie Mortimer: 'Key that frontline services understand what the law means' She also called for better training of police officers. ""It's all very well changing the law and making these things illegal, but if the frontline services don't understand what the law actually means then you've only done half the job."" Research by the University of Suffolk found 95% of police officers who took part in a survey in 2017 said they had not had any training on revenge porn legislation. A joint Ministry of Justice and Home Office statement said: ""When we engaged with victims and campaigners in designing the new law they accepted that the motive for this crime is almost always malicious, rather than sexual, which is why the law considers it a non-sexual offence. ""We launched and continue to support the Revenge Porn helpline, which helps victims to speak with the police and to social media companies about removing the content."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey from the National Police Chiefs' Council said forces ""pursue all lines of inquiry and prosecute people where appropriate"". ""The College of Policing has produced a briefing and training note, which all officers involved in these types of investigations can access.""

"Same-sex marriage is legal in the rest of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland The partner of murdered journalist Lyra McKee has demanded equal marriage rights for same-sex couples in Northern Ireland. Sara Canning, who was addressing a rally of thousands in Belfast, said the current situation was ""not acceptable."" She told the crowds gathered outside City Hall that a law change would be a ""win"" for everyone in Northern Ireland. Ms McKee, 29, wasshot on 18 April while observing rioting in Londonderry. The New IRA saidits members carried outthe killing. Profile: Lyra McKee NI same-sex couples marry in Ireland and GB Her murder led to an outpouring of grief and calls for politicians in Northern Ireland to return to powersharing, two-and-a-half years after the government of the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. A new talks process began atStormont on Tuesday. Lyra McKee was observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate when she was shot dead last month by dissident republicans Saturday's rally was organised by the Love Equality campaign - an umbrella group made up of organisations that support a law change. Ms Canning questioned why same-sex couple were treated differently in Northern Ireland -  same-sex marriage is legal in the rest of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. ""We pay our taxes, we are governed by the same laws, we love deeply and we love dearly - why should we not be afforded the same rights in marriage?"" she asked. ""Equal marriage is not a green or orange issue, a demand of just one side or the other and it shouldn't be a political football."" Ms Canning said she had dreamed of marrying the woman she loved and had shared her dream with Lyra before it was ""snatched away"". Sara Canning said equal marriage was not a ""green or orange issue"" Ms Canning has alreadychallenged the prime minister to legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. She said she spoke to Theresa May at Ms McKee's funeral, asking her to change the laws at Westminster if local politicians failed to act. On Saturday, she reiterated this challenge and said Westminster must legislate on the issue in the continued absence of local government. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the timeline of the same-sex marriage debate in Northern Ireland. Equal marriage is currently one of the main sticking points in Stormont's continuing political crisis. During a vote in November 2015, Northern Ireland's assembly members supported same-sex marriage by a slim majority of 53 votes to 52. However, the motion was blocked by the DUP using a measure known as a petition of concern. The DUP remains firmly opposed to any redefinition of the law, insisting marriage should be between a man and a woman. It has resisted Sinn FÃ©in's calls for a change in the law.

"This video can not be played Some of the protesters marched in a line wearing the letters spelling out ""betrayed"" Rallies against the prosecution of former British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland have been held across the UK. Hundreds of people - many of them waving bannersin support of an Army veteran being prosecuted for the murder of two men on Bloody Sunday- protested outside Broadcasting House in London. One protester said soldiers were being ""persecuted"" for doing their job. Rallies were also held in Glasgow, Cardiff, Bristol and Northern Ireland. The protests, organised by Justice for Northern Ireland Veterans, follow the announcement by Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt earlier this week that British troops and veteranswould be given stronger legal protections against prosecution- proposals that exclude alleged offences in Northern Ireland. Bloody Sunday murder charges for soldier 'Unfair' military prosecutions to be barred Ballymurphy soldiers 'out of control' PM says sorry over Bloody Sunday Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. The cases relate to Daniel Hegarty; Bloody Sunday; John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann (involving two ex-soldiers) and Aidan McAnespie. Not all the charges are murder. In the case of Bloody Sunday, a former British soldier known as Soldier F faces prosecution for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney in Londonderry in 1972. They were shot dead at a civil rights march. The decision to exclude soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles angered protesters with whom the BBC spoke. They also expressed anger at what they say is a lack of media coverage of the issue. This video can not be played Hundreds of bikers also protested through Bristol Dawn Amey said many of the British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland had been ""very young"" and ""fighting for their lives"" Dawn Amey, whose husband and father both served in Northern Ireland and who came to the rally from Colchester in Essex, said: ""Our soldiers, most of them were very young. ""They were fighting for their lives, protecting themselves, and these are the men who are now going to be suffering."" Former serviceman Wayne Stockwell, from Romford, east London, said it was ""just wrong"" that soldiers who served in Northern Ireland were being excluded from the new protections for soldiers against prosecution. Wayne Stockwell said it was wrong that soldiers who served in Northern Ireland were not being given the new protections He added: ""Ex service-personnel didn't ask to go to Northern Ireland, they were sent there, following orders. So if anything, the government was to blame, not the individual soldier."" Jacqueline Smith, who served in the Army in Derry, said it was unfair that British soldiers were now being prosecuted when some Irish republicans were previously told they were no longer wanted by the police. She was referring to so-called""comfort letters"" from the governmentthat were given to republicans suspected of involvement in terrorist crimes but who had never been charged. Jacqueline Smith said it was unfair that British soldiers were now being prosecuted when Irish republicans were previously given royal pardons A protest was also held in Glasgow The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland has said that of 26 so-called Troubles legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 13 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army. The rallies on Saturday were the latest in a series of protests over the last few months, including the Million Veterans March.

"This video can not be played Mr Strache said he resigned because he did not want to provide a pretext for the government's collapse Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has called a snap election following the collapse of his coalition government over a corruption scandal. The move came after Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache resigned after secret footage emerged showing him talking to an alleged Russian investor. Mr Kurz's centre-right People's Party has been in government with Mr Strache's far-right Freedom Party. Austria's president recommended that elections should be held in September. ""This new beginning should take place quickly, as quickly as the provisions of the Federal Constitution permit, so I plead for elections... in September,"" President Alexander van der Bellen said on Sunday. Austria country profile The new face of the far right in Europe The Austrian leader sharing power with the far right On Saturday Mr Kurz said this was not the first time he had had difficulties with the party. ""Even if I didn't express myself publicly at the time, there were many situations that I found difficult to swallow,"" he said. ""After yesterday's video, I must say quite honestly: Enough is enough. ""The serious part of this [video] was the attitude towards abuse of power, towards dealing with taxpayers' money, towards the media in this country,"" Mr Kurz said, adding that he had been personally insulted in the footage. Mr Strache blamed his actions on alcohol and acting like a ""teenager"", saying his behaviour had been ""stupid"" and ""irresponsible"", and that he was leaving to avoid further damage to the government. Analysis by Bethany Bell, BBC News, Vienna The Freedom Party is one of Europe's best-established populist, nationalist parties. But while it is skilled in opposition, frequently gaining over 20% of the vote, its record is much more patchy when it comes to staying in power. In 2002, early elections had to be called when its coalition with the conservatives fell apart. In 2005, the party split over internal disagreements. Other European populist parties will be watching the Freedom Party's next steps closely. This scandal, which comes just a week before the EU elections, is likely to be a blow to attempts by Italy's Matteo Salvini to forge an alliance of nationalist European parties. The Freedom Party, once seen as an example to be emulated, could now serve as a warning. It was published by German media on Friday, but it is not known who recorded it. Neither is it clear who set up the meeting, which allegedly took place at a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza in July 2017. The video shows Mr Strache and Johann Gudenus - also a Freedom Party politician - relaxing on sofas, drinking and talking to a woman who claims to be a wealthy Russian national looking to invest in Austria. In the footage, the woman offers to buy a 50% stake in Austria's Kronen-Zeitung newspaper and switch its editorial position to support the Freedom Party. In exchange, Mr Strache said he could award her public contracts, explaining that he wanted to ""build a media landscape like [Victor] Orban"", a reference to Hungary's prime minister, described by critics as an authoritarian leader. The vice-chancellor also speculates that the Russian's takeover of Kronen-Zeitung could boost support for the party to as much as 34%. ""If you take over the Kronen Zeitung three weeks before the election and get us into first place, then we can talk about everything,"" Mr Strache said. As part of the deal, he suggests the Russian woman ""set up a company like Strabag"", the Austrian construction firm. ""All the government orders that Strabag gets now, [you] would get,"" he continues. Mr Strache also names several journalists who would have to be ""pushed"" from the newspaper, and five other ""new people whom we will build up"".

"Zholia Alemi was found guilty of four theft and fraud charges after a week-long trial last year A bogus psychiatrist who treated hundreds of patients in Scotland may have referred some for needless electro-convulsive therapy, Scotland's chief medical officer has warned. Dr Catherine Calderwood said others may have been detained under the Mental Health Act or ""groomed"" to gain access to their finances. Zholia Alemi worked in the NHS for 22 years despite having no qualifications. One health board confirmed 24 of her patients were detained or ""sectioned"". Alemi wasjailed for five years last Octoberfor defrauding patients. A court in Carlisle heard she faked a patient's will in an attempt to inherit her Â£1.3m estate. 'I was treated by fake psychiatrist' Foreign doctor checks after fake psychiatrist case Drowned man's family fears over fake doctor After her conviction, it emerged that Alemi had dropped out of medical school in her first year in New Zealand but was employed by the NHS after moving to the UK in 1995. She worked at a number of locations across the UK, including six Scottish health boards which have now been asked to check their records about patients she treated. Dr Calderwood has now written to these boards, saying she expects the review to identify some patients who were significantly affected by Alemi's activity  through ""prescription of drugs, electro-convulsive therapy, treatment or diagnosis, or in the use of the Mental Health Act"". In the letter, obtained bythe Herald newspaper,,externalshe also warns:  ""She is known to have befriended and 'groomed' vulnerable people that she came into contact with through working as a psychiatrist, with the ultimate aim of accessing their financial affairs."" Another concern is that she may have played a role in determining outcomes for patients while sitting on mental health tribunals, she said. One health board - NHS Ayrshire and Arran - has confirmed that Alemi treated 395 adults while working as a locum for 18 months from 2007. During this time 24 of these patients were detained by Alemi under the Mental Health Act. NHS Ayrshire and Arran medical director Dr Alison Graham said the health board would be contacting all those affected. She added: ""We would like to apologise for any distress this situation may have caused. If patients were treated by this individual and have concerns, we would advise them to contact our mental health services team."" NHS Tayside said Alemi was employed as a locum psychiatrist for a ""short period"" in 2009 while NHS Greater Glasgow and  Clyde said she worked in the former NHS Argyll & Clyde area between May 2005 and July 2006. It is understood that Alemi also worked in the NHS Borders, NHS Highland and NHS Grampian areas. The General Medical Council (GMC) has said Alemi was allowed to join the UK's medical register under a section of the Medical Act which has not been in force since 2003. This allowed medical graduates from certain Commonwealth countries to register on the basis of qualifications obtained at home, without sitting tests that most foreign doctors have to pass before working in the UK. The GMC said the checks were now more ""rigorous"" and it is reviewing records of up to 3,000 doctors who were allowed to work under the same rules as Alemi. The GMC has createda web page with advice,externalfor anyone who is concerned that they were treated by Alemi.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge says he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the loss of Princess Diana The Duke of Cambridge has said he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the death of his mother, Princess Diana. Prince William made the disclosure in a BBC TV documentary about mental health. He said the ""British stiff upper lip thing"" had its place when times were hard, but people also needed ""to relax a little bit and be able to talk about our emotions because we're not robots"". William also spoke of how working as an air ambulance pilot left him feeling that death was ""just around the door"". He said dealing with the loss of his mother - who died in a 1997 car crash - meant he felt he could relate to others who had suffered a bereavement. He said: ""I've thought about this a lot, and I'm trying to understand why I feel like I do, but I think when you are bereaved at a very young age, any time really, but particularly at a young age, I can resonate closely to that, you feel pain like no other pain. ""I felt that with a few jobs that I did, there were particular personal resonations with the families that I was dealing with,"" he said. Royals launch mental health text line Players and future king discuss mental health William recalls being 'tipped over the edge' He described how the emotional aspect of being an East Anglian Air Ambulance pilot was ""difficult"", especially having come from the military where feelings tend to be put to one side. He said the ambulance world was ""much more open"" and he spoke about experiencing  ""very raw, emotional day-to-day stuff, where you're dealing with families who are having the worst news they could ever possibly have on a day-to-day basis."" ""That raw emotion... I could feel it brewing up inside me and I could feel it was going to take its toll and be a real problem. I had to speak about it."" Royals meet mental health activists FA launches mental health campaign In the BBC One documentary to be screened on Sunday, William speaks to footballers Peter Crouch and Danny Rose, ex-players Thierry Henry and Jermaine Jenas, and England manager Gareth Southgate. They all shared various mental health issues and pressures they have faced in their careers. A young Prince William with his mother Princess Diana in 1987 William and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, have previously spoken about the death of their mother - when they launched a mental health campaign called Heads Together, which encouraged people to talk more openly about their problems. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also teamed up last month to launch a text messaging service for people experiencing a mental health crisis. William, Kate, Meghan and Harry have backed the initiative, called Shout, with Â£3m from their Royal Foundation. The charity running Shout also received a Â£1.5m grant from BBC Children in Need.

If patients were treated by this individual and have concerns, we would advise them to contact our mental health services team."" NHS Tayside said Alemi was employed as a locum psychiatrist for a ""short period"" in 2009 while NHS Greater Glasgow and  Clyde said she worked in the former NHS Argyll & Clyde area between May 2005 and July 2006. It is understood that Alemi also worked in the NHS Borders, NHS Highland and NHS Grampian areas. The General Medical Council (GMC) has said Alemi was allowed to join the UK's medical register under a section of the Medical Act which has not been in force since 2003. This allowed medical graduates from certain Commonwealth countries to register on the basis of qualifications obtained at home, without sitting tests that most foreign doctors have to pass before working in the UK. The GMC said the checks were now more ""rigorous"" and it is reviewing records of up to 3,000 doctors who were allowed to work under the same rules as Alemi. The GMC has createda web page with advice,externalfor anyone who is concerned that they were treated by Alemi.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge says he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the loss of Princess Diana The Duke of Cambridge has said he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the death of his mother, Princess Diana. Prince William made the disclosure in a BBC TV documentary about mental health. He said the ""British stiff upper lip thing"" had its place when times were hard, but people also needed ""to relax a little bit and be able to talk about our emotions because we're not robots"". William also spoke of how working as an air ambulance pilot left him feeling that death was ""just around the door"". He said dealing with the loss of his mother - who died in a 1997 car crash - meant he felt he could relate to others who had suffered a bereavement. He said: ""I've thought about this a lot, and I'm trying to understand why I feel like I do, but I think when you are bereaved at a very young age, any time really, but particularly at a young age, I can resonate closely to that, you feel pain like no other pain. ""I felt that with a few jobs that I did, there were particular personal resonations with the families that I was dealing with,"" he said. Royals launch mental health text line Players and future king discuss mental health William recalls being 'tipped over the edge' He described how the emotional aspect of being an East Anglian Air Ambulance pilot was ""difficult"", especially having come from the military where feelings tend to be put to one side. He said the ambulance world was ""much more open"" and he spoke about experiencing  ""very raw, emotional day-to-day stuff, where you're dealing with families who are having the worst news they could ever possibly have on a day-to-day basis."" ""That raw emotion... I could feel it brewing up inside me and I could feel it was going to take its toll and be a real problem. I had to speak about it."" Royals meet mental health activists FA launches mental health campaign In the BBC One documentary to be screened on Sunday, William speaks to footballers Peter Crouch and Danny Rose, ex-players Thierry Henry and Jermaine Jenas, and England manager Gareth Southgate. They all shared various mental health issues and pressures they have faced in their careers. A young Prince William with his mother Princess Diana in 1987 William and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, have previously spoken about the death of their mother - when they launched a mental health campaign called Heads Together, which encouraged people to talk more openly about their problems. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also teamed up last month to launch a text messaging service for people experiencing a mental health crisis. William, Kate, Meghan and Harry have backed the initiative, called Shout, with Â£3m from their Royal Foundation. The charity running Shout also received a Â£1.5m grant from BBC Children in Need.

"Scott Morrison is Australia's current prime minister Australians are voting in a closely-fought general election on Saturday. The poll will decide whether the conservative Liberal-National Coalition wins a third term or is replaced by a Labor administration led by Bill Shorten. All 151 seats in the House of Representatives will be contested, and half of the 76 seats in the Senate. The election has been hotly contested in several areas, particularly climate change and the economy. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told voters in his last pitch on Thursday: ""Now is the time to get on and keep on with the work of building our economy, by backing in the choices Australians are wanting to make every day."" Meanwhile, Mr Shorten highlighted climate change and urged voters to push for change. ""Vote for the new vision - the new stability, the new determination of a new Labor Government."" Here are some key things to know about the vote. This video can not be played Why Australians get fined if they don't turn up to vote Unlike many other global democracies, Australia has mandatory voting for people aged 18 and over - or they risk a fine. This year has seen a record 96.8% enrolment rate. In contrast, the most recent recent US and UK elections drew an estimated 55% and 69% respectively. Advocates say the mandatory system depolarises the vote and reduces the influence of lobby groups, though critics dispute this. Voting has also been open for three weeks already. More than four million people, about a quarter of voters, have already cast their ballot at ""pre-polling"" booths. The vote that spans outback to Antarctica Mr Morrison only became prime minister last August, after bitter party infighting ousted his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. In doing so, Mr Morrison became Australia's fifth leader since 2013. This video can not be played Australia's decade of internal leadership coups ""It was a peculiarly Australian form of madness,""Mr Turnbull told the BBC in March, speaking about a coup culture which began with Labor in 2010. It's likely to harm the government's standing with voters, predicts Prof Sally Young, a politics expert from the University of Melbourne. ""They're sick of the sniping and undermining,"" she says. ""Knifing a leader - it never goes down well."" Australia has just endured a year of extreme weather events, including destructive floods, bushfires, cyclones and a severe drought. The past summer was the nation's hottest on record. It has made climate change a key election issue in some seats, experts say. Extreme weather has pushed climate change into voters' minds, experts say Last year,the government scrapped plans to set an emissions reduction targetin legislation - prompting fierce criticism. ""Australia's lack of action [on climate change] internationally is becoming more recognised within this country,"" says Prof Young. The University of Sydney's Prof Marc Stears agrees, but says it's unclear how widely it will affect voting decisions. The big climate call coming to Australia How Australia's heat might be here to stay The major parties have been talking up their traditional strengths. That's subjects like jobs and tax relief for the government, and health and education for Labor. They will compete fiercely on economic issues, with both parties promising policies aimed at reducing the cost of living, Bill Shorten has led the Labor opposition for six years Although Australia's economy is the envy of many countries, wages growth is flat, and there is a generational split in attitudes to house prices. How Australia is changing - in 11 charts Mr Morrison is overseeing a minority government, meaning he can ill afford to lose support anywhere in the country. Political observers say he faces challenges from the left and right - a debate that is often framed in geographical terms. In the northern state of Queensland, experts say the government fears losing votes to more socially conservative minor parties and independents. But in Victoria in the south, the electorate is perceived as more progressive. It delivered a resounding victory to Labor in a state election five months ago. Is cash king in Australia's elections? During past elections, Australia's major parties have employed tough rhetoric on immigration issues - particularly regarding asylum seekers. It has often been used to appear strong on issues such as national security, says Prof Stears. Australia holds asylum seekers in offshore detention, under a controversial bipartisan policy That debate resurfaced in February, however it appears that the New Zealand mosque attacks in March may have silenced any dog-whistling rhetoric. Why Australia's PM is talking of dark threats and 'evil' Prof Young says there is some public cynicism about the major parties, pointing to possible increases in support for other candidates. High-profile independent candidates have entered key races, and in New South Wales, a recent state election saw rises in minor party support in rural electorates. In February, Mr Morrison said a ""state actor"" had carried out a cyber attackon the parliament and political parties. Authorities said there was no evidence of electoral interference, but security experts have urged vigilance. Concerns about alleged foreign interference prompted Australia to introduce new laws last year. This video can not be played Is China trying to influence Australian politics? In 2017, several MPs were disqualified for unintentionally breaking a rule that lawmakers cannot be dual citizens when elected. Fifteen parliamentarians were ousted, though six later managed to return after relinquishing their non-Australian citizenships. This video can not be played Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was briefly ousted from parliament because of his dual citizenship The saga sparked comprehensive checks of MPs' statuses. The story of Australia's dual citizenship crisis Opinion polls have narrowed in recent weeks, but Labor still has the edge on a two-party preferred basis. However, those measures also say that Mr Morrison leads Mr Shorten as preferred prime minister. A history of Australia's leadership coups.

"This video can not be played Mr Strache said he resigned because he did not want to provide a pretext for the government's collapse Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has called a snap election following the collapse of his coalition government over a corruption scandal. The move came after Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache resigned after secret footage emerged showing him talking to an alleged Russian investor. Mr Kurz's centre-right People's Party has been in government with Mr Strache's far-right Freedom Party. Austria's president recommended that elections should be held in September. ""This new beginning should take place quickly, as quickly as the provisions of the Federal Constitution permit, so I plead for elections... in September,"" President Alexander van der Bellen said on Sunday. Austria country profile The new face of the far right in Europe The Austrian leader sharing power with the far right On Saturday Mr Kurz said this was not the first time he had had difficulties with the party. ""Even if I didn't express myself publicly at the time, there were many situations that I found difficult to swallow,"" he said. ""After yesterday's video, I must say quite honestly: Enough is enough. ""The serious part of this [video] was the attitude towards abuse of power, towards dealing with taxpayers' money, towards the media in this country,"" Mr Kurz said, adding that he had been personally insulted in the footage. Mr Strache blamed his actions on alcohol and acting like a ""teenager"", saying his behaviour had been ""stupid"" and ""irresponsible"", and that he was leaving to avoid further damage to the government. Analysis by Bethany Bell, BBC News, Vienna The Freedom Party is one of Europe's best-established populist, nationalist parties. But while it is skilled in opposition, frequently gaining over 20% of the vote, its record is much more patchy when it comes to staying in power. In 2002, early elections had to be called when its coalition with the conservatives fell apart. In 2005, the party split over internal disagreements. Other European populist parties will be watching the Freedom Party's next steps closely. This scandal, which comes just a week before the EU elections, is likely to be a blow to attempts by Italy's Matteo Salvini to forge an alliance of nationalist European parties. The Freedom Party, once seen as an example to be emulated, could now serve as a warning. It was published by German media on Friday, but it is not known who recorded it. Neither is it clear who set up the meeting, which allegedly took place at a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza in July 2017. The video shows Mr Strache and Johann Gudenus - also a Freedom Party politician - relaxing on sofas, drinking and talking to a woman who claims to be a wealthy Russian national looking to invest in Austria. In the footage, the woman offers to buy a 50% stake in Austria's Kronen-Zeitung newspaper and switch its editorial position to support the Freedom Party. In exchange, Mr Strache said he could award her public contracts, explaining that he wanted to ""build a media landscape like [Victor] Orban"", a reference to Hungary's prime minister, described by critics as an authoritarian leader. The vice-chancellor also speculates that the Russian's takeover of Kronen-Zeitung could boost support for the party to as much as 34%. ""If you take over the Kronen Zeitung three weeks before the election and get us into first place, then we can talk about everything,"" Mr Strache said. As part of the deal, he suggests the Russian woman ""set up a company like Strabag"", the Austrian construction firm. ""All the government orders that Strabag gets now, [you] would get,"" he continues.

"Mr Strache has acknowledged that the meeting took place, but said it had been ""purely private"" Austria's Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache has been filmed appearing to offer government contracts in exchange for political support. The video, filmed secretly shortly before Austria's election in 2017, shows Mr Strache speaking to a woman who claims to be a Russian investor. Mr Strache also appears to hint at a potentially illegal donation system for the far-right Freedom Party he leads. The revelations come amid high tensions within Austria's coalition government. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the centre-right People's Party is due to make a statement at a press conference on Saturday morning. Senior figures in the coalition government held an emergency meeting on Friday evening. A coalition source told Reuters news agency that Mr Kurz is ruling out continuing to work with Mr Strache. The video was published on Friday in a joint report by the German news magazine Der Spiegel and the daily SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. It is unclear who set up the meeting and who filmed it. The secretly-filmed video shows Mr Strache and Johann Gudenus - also a Freedom Party politician - talking to a woman who claims to be a wealthy Russian citizen looking to invest in Austria. The meeting reportedly took place at a villa on the Spanish island of Ibiza, in a private room with both politicians relaxing on sofas, smoking and drinking. In the footage, the woman says she is the niece of a powerful Russian oligarch. She offers to buy a 50% stake in Austria's Kronen-Zeitung newspaper and switch its editorial position to support the Freedom Party. In exchange, Mr Strache said he could award her public contracts, explaining that he wanted to ""build a media landscape like OrbÃ¡n"", a reference to Hungary's far-right prime minister. The vice-chancellor also speculates that the Russian's takeover of Kronen-Zeitung could boost support for the party to as high as 34%. ""If you take over the Kronen Zeitung three weeks before the election and get us into first place, then we can talk about everything,"" Mr Strache said. As part of the deal, he suggests the Russian woman ""set up a company like Strabag,"" the Austrian construction firm. ""All the government orders that Strabag gets now, [you] would get,"" he continues. Mr Strache also names several  journalists who would have to be ""pushed"" from the newspaper, and five other ""new people whom we will build up"". During the discussions, the vice chancellor says that wealthy donors have paid the Freedom Party through an ""association"" to keep their donations hidden. ""The association is charitable, it's got nothing to do with the party,"" Mr Strache said. ""That way no report goes to the Rechnungshof [Austria's court of auditors]"". The alleged donors named by Mr Strache and Mr Gudenus in the video have denied sending money to the party, according to Der Spiegel and the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. The two men have acknowledged that the meeting took place, but said it had been ""purely private"". They added that they had repeatedly mentioned ""the relevant legal regulations and the necessity to observe Austrian law"" during the encounter.

"Zholia Alemi was found guilty of four theft and fraud charges after a week-long trial last year A bogus psychiatrist who treated hundreds of patients in Scotland may have referred some for needless electro-convulsive therapy, Scotland's chief medical officer has warned. Dr Catherine Calderwood said others may have been detained under the Mental Health Act or ""groomed"" to gain access to their finances. Zholia Alemi worked in the NHS for 22 years despite having no qualifications. One health board confirmed 24 of her patients were detained or ""sectioned"". Alemi wasjailed for five years last Octoberfor defrauding patients. A court in Carlisle heard she faked a patient's will in an attempt to inherit her Â£1.3m estate. 'I was treated by fake psychiatrist' Foreign doctor checks after fake psychiatrist case Drowned man's family fears over fake doctor After her conviction, it emerged that Alemi had dropped out of medical school in her first year in New Zealand but was employed by the NHS after moving to the UK in 1995. She worked at a number of locations across the UK, including six Scottish health boards which have now been asked to check their records about patients she treated. Dr Calderwood has now written to these boards, saying she expects the review to identify some patients who were significantly affected by Alemi's activity  through ""prescription of drugs, electro-convulsive therapy, treatment or diagnosis, or in the use of the Mental Health Act"". In the letter, obtained bythe Herald newspaper,,externalshe also warns:  ""She is known to have befriended and 'groomed' vulnerable people that she came into contact with through working as a psychiatrist, with the ultimate aim of accessing their financial affairs."" Another concern is that she may have played a role in determining outcomes for patients while sitting on mental health tribunals, she said. One health board - NHS Ayrshire and Arran - has confirmed that Alemi treated 395 adults while working as a locum for 18 months from 2007. During this time 24 of these patients were detained by Alemi under the Mental Health Act. NHS Ayrshire and Arran medical director Dr Alison Graham said the health board would be contacting all those affected. She added: ""We would like to apologise for any distress this situation may have caused. If patients were treated by this individual and have concerns, we would advise them to contact our mental health services team."" NHS Tayside said Alemi was employed as a locum psychiatrist for a ""short period"" in 2009 while NHS Greater Glasgow and  Clyde said she worked in the former NHS Argyll & Clyde area between May 2005 and July 2006. It is understood that Alemi also worked in the NHS Borders, NHS Highland and NHS Grampian areas. The General Medical Council (GMC) has said Alemi was allowed to join the UK's medical register under a section of the Medical Act which has not been in force since 2003. This allowed medical graduates from certain Commonwealth countries to register on the basis of qualifications obtained at home, without sitting tests that most foreign doctors have to pass before working in the UK. The GMC said the checks were now more ""rigorous"" and it is reviewing records of up to 3,000 doctors who were allowed to work under the same rules as Alemi. The GMC has createda web page with advice,externalfor anyone who is concerned that they were treated by Alemi.

"Mrs May has pledged to set a timetable for leaving Number 10 following another vote on her Brexit withdrawal agreement Theresa May's successor as prime minister should not call a general election until Brexit is completed, a cabinet minister has warned. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said an early election risked losing to Labour and ""killing Brexit altogether"". His comments come after cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impassecollapsed on Friday. Meanwhile, a poll of Tory members forThe Times,externalputs Boris Johnson as the favourite to succeed Mrs May. Mr Hancocktold the Daily Telegraph,externalit would be a ""disaster"" to call a general election before the UK had left the EU as ""people don't want it"". He added: ""We need to take responsibility for delivering on the referendum result."" Why PM's Brexit plan may not be dead yet Brexit: What happens next? A really simple guide to Brexit ""Who knows what the outcome of a general election would be under these circumstances? A general election before that not only risks Jeremy Corbyn, but it risks killing Brexit altogether."" Mrs May has promised to set a timetable for leaving Downing Streetfollowing a House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June. Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March - but after MPs voted down the deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc three times, the EU gave the UK an extension until 31 October. This prompted talks between the government and Labour to see if they could agree a way to break the impasse but those negotiations ended this week without an agreement. Mr Hancock said the current circumstances would make it difficult to predict the result of any general election before Brexit. He added: ""We've got to deliver Brexit in this parliament, then we can move forward.""

Mr Johnson, whoannounced his intention to runearlier this week, was three times as popular as the next closest choice, ex-Brexit secretary Dominic Raab (13%).

"Kevin Mallory, 62, was convicted under the Espionage Act A former CIA officer has been jailed for 20 years for disclosing military secrets to a Chinese agent, the US justice department says. Kevin Mallory, 62, was found guilty of several spying offences following a two-week trial last June. The fluent Mandarin speaker from Leesburg, Virginia, held top-level security clearance and had access to sensitive documents. He was convicted of selling secrets to China for $25,000 (Â£19,600). Evidence at his trial included a surveillance video which showed him scanning classified documents onto a digital memory card at a post office. He also travelled to Shanghai to meet with a Chinese agent in March and April 2017, the justice department said. The churchgoing patriot who spied for China ""Mallory not only put our country at great risk, but he endangered the lives of [people] who put their own safety at risk for our national defence,"" US attorney Zachary Terwilliger said in a statement. ""This case should send a message to anyone considering violating the public's trust and compromising our national security,"" he added. ""We will remain steadfast and dogged in pursuit of these challenging but critical national security cases."" The Justice Department said Mallory held a number of sensitive jobs with government agencies. He had worked as a covert case officer for the CIA and as an intelligence officer for the Defense intelligence Agency (DIA). ""This case is one in an alarming trend of former US intelligence officers being targeted by China and betraying their country and colleagues,"" Assistant Attorney General John Demers said following the sentencing. Earlier this month, ex-CIA agentJerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty to spying for China.Prosecutors said the naturalised US citizen was paid to divulge information on US covert assets. And last June,former US intelligence officer Ron Rockwell Hansen was also chargedwith attempting to spy for China. He attempted to pass on information and received at least $800,000 (Â£600,000) for acting as a Chinese agent, the justice department said at the time.

"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge says he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the loss of Princess Diana The Duke of Cambridge has said he felt ""pain like no other pain"" after the death of his mother, Princess Diana. Prince William made the disclosure in a BBC TV documentary about mental health. He said the ""British stiff upper lip thing"" had its place when times were hard, but people also needed ""to relax a little bit and be able to talk about our emotions because we're not robots"". William also spoke of how working as an air ambulance pilot left him feeling that death was ""just around the door"". He said dealing with the loss of his mother - who died in a 1997 car crash - meant he felt he could relate to others who had suffered a bereavement. He said: ""I've thought about this a lot, and I'm trying to understand why I feel like I do, but I think when you are bereaved at a very young age, any time really, but particularly at a young age, I can resonate closely to that, you feel pain like no other pain. ""I felt that with a few jobs that I did, there were particular personal resonations with the families that I was dealing with,"" he said.

""That raw emotion... I could feel it brewing up inside me and I could feel it was going to take its toll and be a real problem. I had to speak about it.""
