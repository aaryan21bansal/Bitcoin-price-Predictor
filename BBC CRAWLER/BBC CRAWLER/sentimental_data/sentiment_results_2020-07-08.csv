"Care homes could face a staffing ""black hole"" because of the impact of the government's immigration bill, care leaders have warned. The Cavendish Coalition - which represents UK health and social care groups - says it is gravely concerned. The current proposals would not allow enough overseas workers to be recruited, it has warned. The government said immigration is ""not the answer to the challenges in the social care sector"". Leaders of 37 national care organisations, including the NHS Confederation, have signed the letter to the prime minister. They saythe proposed post-Brexit billcould have a damaging effect on care homes and other social care services, especially as the nation heads towards winter - which could bring further challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Immigration Bill, which has been given initial approval by MPs, repeals EU freedom of movement and introduces a new framework for who can come to live in the UK. The legislation will put EU and European Economic Area (EEA) citizens on an equal footing to immigrants from outside the bloc. It also paves the way for the government to introduce a new points-based system. But the Cavendish Coalition said this points-based system currently does not include social care as the roles do not pass the proposed minimum salary threshold and ""are not classed as a shortage occupation"". Social care needs 'proper wages' - migration chair Eight ways new immigration laws will affect industry What's a skilled worker? And other immigration questions No visas for low-skilled workers, government says One in six workers in the sector is a foreign national and earn on average between Â£16,400 and Â£18,400 in England, says the coalition. But from next January, under the new bill, foreign workers will have to be on a minimum of Â£25,000 to be allowed in to the UK. Danny Mortimer, co-convenor of the Cavendish Coalition and chief executive of NHS Employers, said: ""If adult social care wasn't in a precarious position before coronavirus, it certainly is now."" He said one in five health and care workers have said that they are likely to leave their roles after the pandemic, adding that was ""pretty worrying"" given that the sector had 122,000 vacancies in England alone. The coalition is calling on the government to come up with a ""transitional solution"" to ""navigate the gap"" between the new immigration system and a longer term plan and funding settlement for social care. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Migration Advisory Committee has been very clear in its assertion that immigration is not the answer to the challenges in the social care sector. ""As we implement the new immigration system, we want employers to focus on investing in our domestic work force. ""Additionally, the EU Settlement Scheme means that all EU and EAA citizens, and their family members, currently working in social care can stay in the UK and we are encouraging them to do so.""

"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted British sprinter Bianca Williams has received an apology from the Met Police after she and her partner were pulled over in their car in a stop-and-search. Ms Williams's three-month-old son was also in the car on Saturday when it was stopped in Maida Vale. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick told a committee of MPs officers had visited Ms Williams to apologise for ""distress"" caused by the stop. Ms Williams said police had apologised for the distress but not their actions. Footage of the stop-and-search has been shared widely on social media. Ms Williams believes officers racially profiled her and her partner Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese international 400m runner, because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. They say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? Met refers British sprinter stop-and-search Williams' 'heart hurts' after police stop car Despite two reviews by the force's directorate of professional standards, Dame Cressida said the force had found no misconduct by its officers. However, because of the public interest in the case, the Met has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 Earlier, Dame Cressida told the Home Affairs Select Committee: ""We apologised yesterday to Ms Williams and I apologise again for the distress this stop clearly caused her. ""I think all of us watching could empathise with somebody who is stopped in a vehicle, who has a young child in the back, who does not probably know what exactly is going on, and is subsequently found, together with her partner, not to be carrying anything illicit."" Dame Cressida said she has asked a senior officer to review the Met's handcuffing practices to make sure it hasn't become a ""default"", and has set up an ""oversight group"" looking at the use of force. ""Every time we see a video that is of concern we review them, we see if there are any lessons to be learned,"" she told MPs. Ina statement on Instagram,external, Ms Williams wrote that the couple welcomed the referral of the incident to the IOPC. She said: ""An independent investigation is now necessary, as the Metropolitan Police have proved that they cannot be trusted to investigate a complaint themselves, having already publicly stated that there has been 'no misconduct'."" ""We have now received an apology for the distress the incident caused us, but significantly, not for the wholly unjustified actons (sic) that officers took against our family. ""We are now contacting the IOPC through our lawyers and will assist fully with their investigation, which we hope will be rigorous,"" Ms Williams added. IOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said the IOPC would look at whether the use of stop and search was appropriate and proportionate in line with approved police policies, adding: ""We will also investigate if racial profiling or discrimination played a part in the incident."" By BBC Reality Check In 2018-19, police officers in England and Wales used handcuffs just over 300,000 times. Around 16% of those people cuffed were black. This means that, when we look at people who were handcuffed relative to their population in the 2011 Census, black people were roughly six times more likely to be handcuffed than white people. Not all people who get arrested are handcuffed and not all handcuffed people get arrested. However, the ratio of handcuffing to arrests shows a great discrepancy between black and white people: â¢ In 2018-19, 452,000 white people were arrested and 210,000 were handcuffed â¢ Over the same period, 60,000 black people were arrested and 49,000 were handcuffed Ch Supt Karen Findlay, who is in charge of the Territorial Support Group which conducted the stop, and local area commander Helen Harper, also informed Ms Williams about the IOPC referral and the next steps in the process. But Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball told the committee there had been ""good grounds"" for the car to be stopped and at that point the officers involved did not know who was in it. Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car Nothing was found in the search, which the Met said was carried out by officers patrolling the Maida Vale area in response to an increase in violence involving weapons. The force also said the vehicle was seen driving suspiciously, including on the wrong side of the road, and that the driver sped off when asked to stop. But this account was rejected by Ms Williams, who has said she is considering legal action against the Met. ""I feel very hurt by their actions, and to witness my partner being taken away and for me to be taken away from my son, my heart hurts,"" she said this week. The Bianca Williams incident has intensified the focus on the use of force by police in the UK, particularly by the Metropolitan Police. Figures published by the Home Affairs Committee suggest handcuff use in the Met has quadrupled in three years, from 5,559 instances in April and May 2017 to 25,251 over the same period this year. The statistics indicate the rise has been driven by a surge in handcuffing of ""compliant"" individuals. Scotland Yard says comparisons with earlier years aren't possible because the data are unreliable, but Dame Cressida Dick's decision to set up a review shows she's seeking reassurance that handcuffs haven't become the norm. The commissioner says she's also monitoring stop-and-search figures ""like a hawk"" and acknowledged concern that in one month alone, May, 8,200 searches of black boys and men aged 15-24 were carried out - without any weapon, stolen goods or drugs being found.

"""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to,"" says Kiri Pritchard-McLean Comedy clubs have called for a slice of the government's Â£1.5bn emergency arts funding, with a warning that hundreds face closure within the next year. Comedy was not mentioned when the government announced its bailout package for the arts on Sunday. Half of the clubs that took part in a Live Comedy Association survey said they would definitely face permanent closure without financial support. Chair Brid Kirby said small venues were ""the bedrock of the entire industry"". She told BBC News: ""All of the household names will have started in those clubs. The risk of those clubs disappearing therefore poses a risk that we could lose a whole new generation of voices from the industry."" Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package The association surveyed more than 660 people working in comedy, from venue owners and stand-up performers to producers and publicists, about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It found: 49.2% of venues think they will definitely face permanent closure without further funding or support 45% of workers have given serious thought to leaving comedy 24% have taken up work outside comedy 28% have been ineligible for any government assistance, despite needing support 73.5% have found their mental health negatively impacted by job uncertainty There are 600 comedy clubs in the UK, according to the association. Kirby said: ""We need live comedy to be included in the distribution of this Â£1.57bn. ""The concern currently is that as we have had a longstanding history of being overlooked as an art form [for funding], we're really worried at not seeing comedy listed in the press release and not being able to get any clarity on whether we will be included once the details are announced."" This video can not be played How comedians went online to survive lockdown Kirby has met officials from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), who told her there was no reason comedy would be actively excluded but that they were waiting for guidelines, she said. A DCMS spokesperson told BBC News: ""This week we announced the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture to help the industry through the coronavirus pandemic. This funding will provide targeted support to organisations and venues across a range of sectors and detailed eligibility criteria will be set out in the coming weeks."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, comedian Shazia Mirza said small clubs were vital for all performers who go on to play bigger venues or star on TV. ""We've been ignored because no money is being pumped into these small clubs,"" she said. Mark Watson said Britain's live comedy scene is ""the best and most vibrant in the world"" Fellow stand-up Kiri Pritchard-McLean warned: ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how the industry works, least of all comedy. ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant comedy clubs, which means you can gig several times a night and get really great at what you do. ""If those institutions aren't being helped... then it disappears and we stop being world leaders in this."" In a statement, comic Mark Watson said the British live comedy scene was ""the best and most vibrant in the world"" and ""produces work on a fraction of the budgets enjoyed by theatre, opera, or anything else"". He added: ""Any rescue plan for the performing arts needs to include it."" The government has said the grants and loans would be available to ""the performing arts and theatres, heritage, historic palaces, museums, galleries, live music and independent cinema"".

"This video can not be played Sir Mark Sedwill: The decision to stand down was ""amicable"". The UK's top civil servant will receive a payout of almost Â£250,000 when he steps down in September. Sir Mark Sedwill confirmed he was leaving Whitehall last month as Boris Johnson announced plans to split his role as cabinet secretary and national security adviser into two posts. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team in Downing Street. On Wednesday, the PM signed off the Â£248,189 pension contribution. The amount was recommended by Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm, with advice from Civil Service Human Resources and legal advisers, before being agreed by Mr Johnson. In a note from No 10, the PM said the payment was ""likely to be in the form of a pension contribution"" for Sir Mark. What do the UK's 450,000 civil servants actually do? UK's top civil servant announces exit Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Mark told the National Security Strategy Committee he had not ""resigned"" but left his post ""by agreement"" with the PM. ""We had concluded it was time to split the jobs again and have a separate security adviser and separate cabinet secretary,"" he added. Sir Mark said the timing was ""at his initiative"", as it was ""never my intention to do that [job] long-term"", but the departure was ""entirely amicable"". The UK's chief negotiator in post-Brexit trade talks with the EU, David Frost, will take over as national security adviser as a political appointee. The Cabinet Office has published a job advert for the cabinet secretary position, with a salary of Â£200,000, and the role is open to current and former permanent secretaries. The person who gets the position will advise the prime minister on implementing policy and the conduct of government. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the prime minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. Sir Mark is a career diplomat who served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office, before working alongside former Prime Minister Theresa May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice followingSir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Asked about reports of anonymous briefings from Downing Street against him, Sir Mark told the committee that civil servants had become ""fair game"" and it ""goes with the territory"". He added: ""It is never pleasant to find oneself, particularly as an official, in the midst of stories of that kind. ""I don't think it is ever pleasant in government, whether it is against ministers, between them and particularly against officials, when you have briefings to which you cannot really reply, particularly those that are off the record and sniping away. ""But it is a regrettable feature of modern politics, I'm afraid."" After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer and will chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations.

Mr Stewart says: ""As the chancellor made clear this is just the next step in our recovery programme."" Further measures will be brought in at the right point he says and the Â£30bn announced today comes on top of all the other measures the UK government has announced already, he says. The UK government  minister encourages the first minister now to do all she can to make sure the tourism and hospitality sectors don't suffer a ""three winter period"" in Scotland. Mr Stewart argues that the""eat out to help out"" discountwill help the sector return. On the Scottish government announcementon air bridges,he says he has not seen any evidence to suggest Spain as a whole is not safe to travel to. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes says today'spackage of measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunakgives the Scottish government ""neither the powers nor the funding to tailor our response to the Scottish economyâ. ""Whilst there are
elements we welcome, particularly the focus on jobs, and the temporary cut to
VAT, my hopes have certainly been dashed because it would appear a lot of the substantial
decisions have been delayed until the autumn,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. Of the Â£30bn announced, the
Scottish government will only receive Â£21m, she says, which is ""less than 0.1%"". Ms Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had called for an Â£80bn package equivalent to 4% of GDP, as is happening in Germany. ""The
Â£30bn today doesnât even come to half of that,"" points out the finance secretary, who said she - along with counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland - has asked the Treasury on Tuesday for ""minor fiscal flexibilities"" to allow the devolved nations to
respond individually. ""Essentially todayâs announcement
bypasses devolution completely and doesnât provide that funding or the powers,â Ms Forbes added. A total of 4,173 Scots
deaths have been linked to Covid-19 as of 5 July, official figures show. TheNational Records of Scotland (NRS) figures,externalindicate that is an increase of 17 deaths from
the previous week. From 29 June to 5 July, 40 fewer deaths from all causes were registered compared with the average number for this time of year. New analysis of deaths registered up to 14 June shows that deaths among people from the South Asian ethnic group were almost twice as likely to involve Covid-19 than deaths in the White ethnic group, after accounting for age group, sex, area deprivation and urban/rural classification. The NRS weekly figures are higher than the daily figure announced by Nicola Sturgeon because they include all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested.

Some of the measures directly affect Scotland while others will result in about Â£800m more for the Scottish government to distribute as they choose. Our Economy and Business Editor Douglas Fraserexplains all here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A woman who says she experiences feelings of ""claustrophobia"" and ""suffocation"" when wearing a face covering is concerned she won't be be able to fly to Portugal to be reunited with her family later this month. Ryanair's terms state that if you suffer from a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a face mask, you are exempted ""on provision of a medical certificate attesting your condition.â But her doctor is currently refusing to provide her with one, based on Scottish government guidance that an exemption letter is not required. ""I thought I would get into the habit because I would be wearing one for five to six hours, but when I tried one on in the shop, it just made
me feel very panicky,"" the woman told BBC Scotland's Drivetime. ""I have felt claustrophobic before, but have never had a panic attack. This was just
awful. Now the thought of putting it on makes me feel so anxious."" She says he has already experienced ""funny stares"" from people when travelling by train without a face mask and worries she will feel similarly ""alienated"" if she gets permission to fly.

The move to ease quarantine rules from Friday means Scots can travel to a number of countries without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, although Spain is not included on the list. Ken McNabb, managing director of the Travel Company Edinburgh says it is a ""major step forward"" for those in the travel industry. ""I appreciate Spain has had a surge in coronavirus cases, as has Serbia, so there is just cause to leave these out,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland ""Moving people into these countries [on the approved list] is fine, we've got a lot of people we can cover. ""I'm quite sure the majority of travel agencies around the country will be whooping and shouting with joy. We've got this door opened to get people away."" So people travelling to and from Spain will still have to go into quarantine when arriving in Scotland. However the Scottish government has approved almost all of the ""air bridge"" travel destinations set out by UK ministers. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports which owns and
manages Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said: âTodayâs announcement means airlines
can now start making decisions on what flights they will operate, however, the
glaring omission is Spain which accounts for 60% of our leisure flights. âWeâve requested a meeting with
the Scottish government to discuss what further measures could be put in place
that would allow the lifting of restrictions and prevent airlines from
cancelling routes to what is one of Scotlandâs most popular and important
tourism destinations.â From Friday, travellers are exempt from quarantine rules when they arrive in Scotland from: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Croatia, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan The Vatican City made the list but Spain and Serbia did not Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, RÃ©union, San Marino, Seychelles, South Korea, St BarthÃ©lemy, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Pierre and Miquelon, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Vatican City, Vietnam. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Barry McCulloch, the senior policy advisor for the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, thinks overall he got what he wanted from Rishi Sunak. Mr McCulloch tells Drivetime: ""I think overall it struck the right chord and provided some good news that has been in short supply for three months."" The chancellor announcedan ""eat out to help out"" scheme which offers a 50% discount for every diner, up to Â£10 a head, from Monday to Wednesday throughout August. Gino Stornaiuolo, who owns a couple of Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which will participate in the scheme says: ""This is going to further encourage people to hopefully come out and dine."" Mr Stornaiuolo says if his restaurants can do a bit more business from Monday to Wednesday that will be a great help. In response to the six-month VAT cut for restaurants, hotels and attractions, the restaurateur says: ""I'll take any VAT cut."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So what has the reaction been to the chancellor's announcements around Scotland? Alan Henderson, who owns several pubs, restaurants and a hotel in Aberdeen. tells Drivetime: ""Clearly it's great news for the hospitality sector. ""We're probably the sector that's suffered as much as anyone."" Mr Henderson says: ""It's a real shot in the arm and I totally endorse the chancellor's comments, the hospitality sector employs a lot of young people."" He applauds the chancellor's efforts to create and keep jobs for the young. Rishi Sunak The Chancellor has said his package of measures aimed at limiting the economic impact of coronavirus are ""absolutely vital"" for Scotland. Rishi Sunak said many rural areas of Scotland would particularly benefit from a cut to VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector. And he said Scotland would now receive a total of Â£4.6bn in additional Barnett funding from the UK government. The figure had been put at Â£3.6bn by the UK government before his statement. The Scottish government welcomed parts of Mr Sunak's announcement, but accused him of showing a lack of ambition by not introducing the Â£80bn stimulus package it had called for. Many of the measures unveiled by Mr Sunak will apply in Scotland, including the ""job retention bonus"" that will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for at least three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland ""At least we have clarity,"" says travel agent Shona Thorne on the Scottish government's publication of countries from where travellers will be exempt from quarantine rules. She does express surprise at Spain not being included, telling BBC Radio Scotland: ""That caught most of us out."" Ms Thorne believes airlines will avoid any knee-jerk reaction since the list is to be reviewed again on 20 July and flights will not resume in earnest until 15 July. ""There are lots of questions around quarantine,"" she explains. ""We're asking customers to be patient in the short term."" It is also important to remember that there are several nations on the list that UK residents cannot enter presently - or will be subject to testing or quarantine on arrival, she stresses.

BBC Radio Scotland The outlook remains grim for many Scottish retailers according to an industry spokesman, despite a  wide-rangingpackage of measures unveiled by Chancellor Rishi Sunakdesigned to help the UK recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The measures include a Â£2bn jobs programme for young people, a VAT cut for the hospitality sector and cash bonuses for businesses that retain staff when the furlough scheme ends. But Ewan Macdonald Russell of the Scottish Retail Consortium told BBC Radio Scotland: ""Some jobs will go in retail. We won't have as many shops open - we know that from the pressures on the industry. ""If we get a second wave of this virus and see shops having to close down, especially during the golden trading period of October-November, at that point the government is going to have to look again at what support it might need. That could be cataclysmic for the industry."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9800392
"""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to,"" says Kiri Pritchard-McLean Comedy clubs have called for a slice of the government's Â£1.5bn emergency arts funding, with a warning that hundreds face closure within the next year. Comedy was not mentioned when the government announced its bailout package for the arts on Sunday. Half of the clubs that took part in a Live Comedy Association survey said they would definitely face permanent closure without financial support. Chair Brid Kirby said small venues were ""the bedrock of the entire industry"". She told BBC News: ""All of the household names will have started in those clubs. The risk of those clubs disappearing therefore poses a risk that we could lose a whole new generation of voices from the industry."" Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package The association surveyed more than 660 people working in comedy, from venue owners and stand-up performers to producers and publicists, about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It found: 49.2% of venues think they will definitely face permanent closure without further funding or support 45% of workers have given serious thought to leaving comedy 24% have taken up work outside comedy 28% have been ineligible for any government assistance, despite needing support 73.5% have found their mental health negatively impacted by job uncertainty There are 600 comedy clubs in the UK, according to the association. Kirby said: ""We need live comedy to be included in the distribution of this Â£1.57bn. ""The concern currently is that as we have had a longstanding history of being overlooked as an art form [for funding], we're really worried at not seeing comedy listed in the press release and not being able to get any clarity on whether we will be included once the details are announced."" This video can not be played How comedians went online to survive lockdown Kirby has met officials from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), who told her there was no reason comedy would be actively excluded but that they were waiting for guidelines, she said. A DCMS spokesperson told BBC News: ""This week we announced the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture to help the industry through the coronavirus pandemic. This funding will provide targeted support to organisations and venues across a range of sectors and detailed eligibility criteria will be set out in the coming weeks."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, comedian Shazia Mirza said small clubs were vital for all performers who go on to play bigger venues or star on TV. ""We've been ignored because no money is being pumped into these small clubs,"" she said. Mark Watson said Britain's live comedy scene is ""the best and most vibrant in the world"" Fellow stand-up Kiri Pritchard-McLean warned: ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how the industry works, least of all comedy. ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant comedy clubs, which means you can gig several times a night and get really great at what you do. ""If those institutions aren't being helped... then it disappears and we stop being world leaders in this."" In a statement, comic Mark Watson said the British live comedy scene was ""the best and most vibrant in the world"" and ""produces work on a fraction of the budgets enjoyed by theatre, opera, or anything else"". He added: ""Any rescue plan for the performing arts needs to include it."" The government has said the grants and loans would be available to ""the performing arts and theatres, heritage, historic palaces, museums, galleries, live music and independent cinema"".

"Europe are the current holders of the Ryder Cup after beating the US in the 2018 match at Le Golf National in France The 2020 Ryder Cup has been postponed for a year because the coronavirus pandemic means the event cannot be staged safely with spectators present. The match between the United States and Europe was due to be held at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin on 25-27 September. But the biennial event has now been rescheduled for 24-26 September 2021. ""The spectators make it a unique and compelling event and playing without them was not a realistic option,"" said PGA of America chief Seth Waugh. ""It became clear that our medical experts and the public authorities in Wisconsin could not give us certainty that conducting an event responsibly with thousands of spectators in September would be possible. ""Given that uncertainty, we knew rescheduling was the right call."" Professional men's golf in the US has resumed behind closed doors butplayers have said the Ryder Cup should not go ahead without fans. The women's Solheim Cup is scheduled to take place from 4-6 September, 2021 in Ohio and LPGA commissioner Mike Whan has told BBC Sport that the Ryder Cup decisiondoes not affect their plans. Iain Carter analysis - Ryder Cup fate sealed by players Solheim Cup to stick to Septemeber 2021 dates This video can not be played Former captain Clarke backs decision to postpone Ryder Cup The European Tour announced that the qualification process for the European team has been frozen until the beginning of 2021. And the next Ryder Cup to be held in Europe has been pushed back a year with Rome now set to host the event in 2023. Europe captain Padraig Harrington said it was a ""relief"" that organisers decided to postpone the competition. ""For me, it was very messy behind the scenes,"" the 48-year-old Irishman said. ""The decision was based on health and safety, but trying to get organised behind the scenes, it was going to be incredibly difficult to pull a team together that was fair and representative, and all the complications that go with it. ""For example, what happens if a player gets Covid? What happens if there's a cluster? Do players have to quarantine?"" Harrington also said that if the Ryder Cup went ahead without fans then it would have lost part of its character. ""The team atmosphere the crowd generate, that would've been missed,"" the three-time major winner added. ""When you win in a tournament it's very exciting, but you don't get the same experience as you would at the Ryder Cup. ""I've seen over the years, the amount of players that come out of their shell in terms of their personality because of the crowds and that would be missed."" In 2018 Europe regained the trophy with a 17Â½-10Â½ win over USA in the 42nd edition of the biennial competition. Meanwhile, there has been a knock-on effect from the rescheduling with next September's Presidents Cup - between the US and a Rest of the World team - at Quail Hollow also now postponed for a year. The Wells Fargo Championship will be played at its traditional venue at Quail Hollow in 2021 and at TPC Potomac in 2022, during Presidents Cup year. This year's PGA Tour in the US has played four events behind closed doors following the shutdown enforced by coronavirus, despite a handful of positive tests, while the European Tour will resume on 22 July with the first of six successive UK events. The number of daily coronavirus cases is rising again in the US withfears it could reach 100,000 per day. Only three of the four annual men's majors are scheduled to take place in 2020 - all of them in the United States - after the Open Championship, due to be played from 15-18 July at Royal St George's in Kent, was cancelled. The rearranged USPGA Championship is now set to be the first major of the year but that will be held behind closed doors in San Francisco from 6-9 August. The US Open is to be played at Winged Foot in New York State from 17-20 September, with the Masters following from 12-15 November at Augusta National. BBC Sport golf correspondent Iain Carter It was clear there were two different camps: those who know the financial difficulties of navigating this period without holding an event that is their biggest cash cow, and the players. These golfers had no interest in generating roars and cheers that would only be heard in living rooms. They need to hear them for themselves -  that is what makes the Ryder Cup such an attractive proposition for them. And it was that view that ultimately held sway. The players are everything and their views are the ones that played the biggest part in the decision to postpone until 2021. So we will wait another year. Hopefully former Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn's fears are unfounded, although there is plenty to suggest he makes a worryingly worthwhile point over whether it will be possible to have fans at the match in 2021.

"Amadou Gon Coulibaly had just returned from heart treatment in France Ivory Coast's PM Amadou Gon Coulibaly has died after falling ill at a ministerial meeting. The 61-year-old had been chosen as the ruling party's candidate for October's presidential election, after Alassane Ouattara said he would not seek a third term in office. Mr Gon Coulibaly had only just returned from France where he had received two-months' heart treatment. President Ouattara said the country was in mourning. He said Mr Gon Coulibaly had become unwell during a weekly cabinet meeting and was taken to hospital where he later died. ""I pay tribute to my younger brother, my son, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who was for 30 years my closest partner,"" the president said. ""I salute the memory of a statesman of great loyalty, devotion and love for the homeland."" Mr Gon Coulibaly's death creates huge uncertainty over the election. He had received a heart transplant in 2012 and had travelled to Paris on 2 May for the insertion of a stent. He returned last Thursday saying: ""I am back to take my place by the side of the president, to continue the task of developing and building our country."" Mr Gon Coulibaly was among the favourites to win the presidential election. An article in Le Monde on Monday quoted one foreign observer as saying: ""If Gon Coulibaly were unfit, Ouattara would have no choice but to run as a candidate because there is no plan B. ""This matter has so far remained taboo because the president has clearly shown his willingness to leave and indicated who his choice was to succeed him."" Mr Ouattara's decision in March not to run stunned the country. At the time, the BBC's James Copnall wrote from the main city, Abidjan, that there was praise from politicians as Mr Ouattara broke the normal mould for the region of trying to remain in power. How Ivory Coast's president stunned West Africa Even then it was clear that Mr Gon Coulibaly would be backed as the successor candidate.  Bornon New Year's Day in 1948 Memberof the Islamic faith MarriedFrench businesswoman Dominique Folloroux  in  1991 PhDin economics and worked for IMF Sworn inas president on 6 May 2011 after years in opposition Mr Ouattara's supporters say he has brought economic growth, stability and a renewed standing for Ivory Coast on the international stage. But opposition politicians - and many Ivorians - say that the president has not done enough to bring the nation together, and heal the wounds of the bitter conflict that divided Ivory Coast and then brought him to power. Around 3,000 people are thought to have died in the war sparked by candidate Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to accept he had lost the 2010 elections to Mr Ouattara, before troops loyal to the current president arrested Mr Gbagbo in April 2011. The long-running political disputes between him, Mr Ouattara and another former president, Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ©, have been disastrous for Ivory Coast.

"June Wray had chronic pain after a vaginal mesh repair Many lives have been ruined because officials failed to hear the concerns of women given drugs and procedures that caused them or their babies considerable harm, saysa review,external. More than 700 women and their families shared ""harrowing"" details about vaginal mesh, pregnancy test Primodos and epilepsy drug sodium valproate. Too often worries and complaints were dismissed as ""women's problems"". It said arrogant attitudes left women traumatised, intimidated and confused. The patients who fought for answers 'No-one believed my pain' Review chair Baroness Julia Cumberlege said she was shocked by the ""sheer scale"" and ""intensity of suffering"". She said: ""I have conducted many reviews and inquiries over the years, but I have never encountered anything like this. ""Much of this suffering was entirely avoidable, caused and compounded by failings in the health system itself."" She said even now the exact numbers of women affected by the three issues was still not known and praised campaigners for fighting to raise the problems. The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and support organs The cases span decades and are thought to affect hundreds of thousands of women and babies. The review looked at three treatments: Primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test, withdrawn from the market in the 1978, which is thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages. The manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, has always denied a link between the drug and deformities in babies. Sodium valproate - an epilepsy drug which, while effective for preventing seizures, can be harmful if taken during pregnancy, causing physical abnormalities to the baby in the womb as well as developmental delay and autism in children whose mothers took it. Pelvic mesh implants - used as a surgical option to treat prolapse and incontinence, some women say they have been left with internal damage and agonising chronic pain ""like razors inside the body"". In the last few years, the procedure has only been offered on the NHS under exceptional circumstances and high vigilance. The mesh is made of a polypropylene, a type of plastic The review has set out the missed opportunities when something could or should have been done to prevent harm. It said there was a culture of denial by a disjointed and defensive healthcare system that failed to listen to patients' concerns. Hundreds of babies are being born each year to mothers ""unaware"" of the risks that sodium valproate can pose in pregnancy, said the review. While some women have benefited from mesh implants, others have been left in agony. Kate Langley, Marie Lyon and June Wray have all been affected June Wray, 73 and from Newcastle, experienced chronic pain after having a vaginal mesh procedure in 2009. ""Sometimes the pain is so severe, I feel like I will pass out,"" she said. ""But when I told GPs and surgeons, they didn't believe me. They just looked at me like I was mad."" Kate Langley had a mesh fitted in 2012 for incontinence problems. She said it had had a massive impact on her life, leading to more than 50 admissions to hospital when she was in acute pain. ""It was so hard to deal with. Years of going from one doctor to another."" She has now had four operations to remove the mesh. Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos when she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born with a shortened arm. She began campaigning in 1978 and said the review was a ""relief that there has finally been an acknowledgement"" of the situation. Mrs Lyon, chairwoman of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, said there was also ""great sadness"" that many of the original campaign members were not alive to see the result of the review. The review warned against pushing innovative treatments without enough long-term monitoring, and criticises manufacturers for being motivated by sales ahead of safety. And it recommended: Appointing an independent patient safety commissioner to hold the health system to account Setting up discretionary payment schemes to meet the financial care costs of those already affected Creating a redress agency to help resolve future disputes Transparency of payments made to doctors by pharmaceutical and medical device companies Kath Sansom, founder of Sling the Mesh campaign and a mother of two, said: ""The report is hard hitting and recognises the total failure in patient safety, regulation and oversight in the UK. ""It also makes it very clear that our medical establishment is deeply entrenched in institutional denial and misogyny. ""While we welcome all of the recommendations, there is no glory in knowing thousands of women have been maimed by mesh since the late 1990s then ignored when they asked for help suffering debilitating, life altering and irreversible pain."" Epilepsy Action deputy chief executive Simon Wigglesworth said: ""Nothing can undo the avoidable harm and distress that has been caused by the decades of government silence and inaction."" Health Minister Nadine Dorries said she was determined to make the changes needed to protect women in the future. ""Our health system must learn from those it has failed. ""We will now give this independent review the full and careful consideration it deserves before setting out our full response.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says travel quarantine arrangements will be reviewed on 20 July People travelling to and from Spain will still have to go into quarantine when arriving in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The Scottish government has approved almost all of the ""air bridge"" travel destinations set out by UK ministers. This means that from 10 July, Scots can travel to 57 other countries without having to self-isolate on returning. However, Spain and Serbia have been omitted from the list due to concerns about the prevalence of Covid-19. The first minister said this was a ""very difficult decision"" to make, but that it was needed to ""protect Scotland as far as possible from a resurgence of this virus in the weeks ahead"". And she warned that people should not seek to ""get around"" the restrictions by travelling via English airports, insisting that the rules ""are here for a reason"". Where can I take a foreign holiday this summer? The UK government had set out a list of 59 countries around the world which it said now pose a ""reduced risk"" from coronavirus, and which would no longer be subject to quarantine rules. These include most countries in Europe, island nations in the Caribbean and countries further east - including Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Nicola Sturgeon said cases entering Scotland from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"" Scottish ministers - who have the final say on public health arrangements north of the border - have now approved this list, but with two exceptions. Ms Sturgeon said the lower prevalence of the virus in Scotland meant its position was ""a bit different to that of the UK as a whole"". And she said that ""we cannot in good conscience lift restrictions"" for people arriving from Spain or Serbia. The first minister said this was ""the best balance we can arrive at"", and said she hoped the situation could be updated in the near future. The move means anyone entering Scotland from Spain or Serbia will have to go into self-isolation even if they travel via an English airport. Spot-checks are conducted on people who are meant to be in quarantine, and fines can be levied if it is found they are not. David Curran from Glasgow has an apartment in Majorca which he has not visited since October last year. He and his family have flights to the Spanish island on 21 July - and is confident they will go through with their plans - but says he believes there is ""no need"" for a quarantine. David told the BBC he does not believe holidaymakers from Scotland want staycations ""Nicola Sturgeon is getting information from scientists, but personally I think she's trying to turn it into a Scotland-England thing,"" he said. ""I'm still optimistic it'll be dropped by the time we come back, but it's as if she just wants people to have holidays in Scotland this year. ""But as she was saying that, my window wipers couldn't keep up with the rain - the majority of people in Scotland don't want to go on holiday in Scotland."" The Scottish government has targeted the effective elimination of coronavirus north of the border, and Ms Sturgeon said the importation of new cases from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"". She said it was estimated that for every 100,000 people in Scotland, 28 currently have coronavirus. She said this compared to 128 across the UK as a whole, and about 330 in Spain - a ""significantly higher prevalence"" of the virus. She said ministers had taken a ""very difficult decision"" to omit Spain and Serbia from the list, and that the move was ""evidence-driven and motivated only by a desire to protect Scotland as far as possible"". Economic impact of travel Â£79mTotal spend 205,000Visits 5thBiggest tourism market 6days average length of stay Figures from VisitScotland suggest Spain is Scotland's fifth largest market in terms of tourism visitors, with 205,000 visits recorded in 2018. The first minister said she knew Scots loved travelling to Spain and that Scottish businesses welcomed many Spanish tourists, adding that the position could change ""possibly very soon"". Ms Sturgeon also urged Scots to have a ""staycation"" this summer rather than going on holiday abroad. ""Remember that this is about trying to stop people getting a deadly and damaging virus and trying to minimise as far as possible any further loss of life,"" she said. From Friday, travellers are exempt from quarantine rules when they arrive in Scotland from: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Croatia, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, RÃ©union, San Marino, Seychelles, South Korea, St BarthÃ©lemy, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Pierre and Miquelon, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Vatican City, Vietnam.

"Coronavirus has dealt a blow to incomes, job prospects and our future prosperity. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has delivered a summer statement, outlining his ambitions for a recovery from the economic harm done by the virus. This is how it might affect your finances. Policies announced by the chancellor on homes, tax and insulation are, in many ways, dwarfed by the prospects for people's jobs. Wages remain key for the health of an individual's finances. Mr Sunak announcedvarious schemesto give incentives to employers to bring furloughed employees back to work, to encourage them to employ young workers, and to improve skills training. The sales tax - VAT - included in the cost of food, accommodation and attractions will be cut until mid-January from 20% to 5% The temporary cut should see prices fall when eating out or going out, which should help those whose income has been affected by the virus. However, it is not clear how much benefit consumers will see. For example, lots of people are staying away from holidays and attractions at the moment, worried about the virus and their ability to spend money. There is also a question over whether there is the capacity to let them in, given social distancing. Another point of debate is whether these businesses will pass on the VAT cut in the form of lower prices. Many in the sector will consider this an opportunity to shore up the finances of their ailing businesses. This means they may, in effect, keep the extra money by not cutting their prices. The chancellor said that there will be discounts of up to Â£10 per head for anyone eating out at participating restaurants from Mondays to Wednesdays in the month of August. Diners who often make use of money-off vouchers may find this mirrors their normal discount. Until now, in England and Northern Ireland, stamp duty has been paid on land or property sold for Â£125,000 or more. There are different rates and systems in Scotland and Wales. Buyers usually pay their duty based on the price on the day the sale is completed, and they have to give the money to HM Revenue and Customs within 14 days. Now, the chancellor has said this threshold in England and Northern Ireland will increase - with immediate effect  - to Â£500,000 until 31 March. He said that, on average, people buying a home would save Â£4,500. Current homeowners moving on could see a saving of up to Â£14,999. The housing market, as with the rest of the economy, has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The lockdown meant activity slowed sharply, with sales at half the levels of a year earlier. The idea is that housing chains will get moving again, as people make the most of the stamp duty holiday. That would be good for everyone on that chain, and for the UK economy as a whole (of which the housing sector is a key part). Yet, back in 2012, the then-chancellor George Osborne said a stamp duty holiday had been ineffective in helping people to buy a home when he cancelled a similar scheme. There is also a limit on how much first-time buyers would benefit from this. Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? Some 16% of sales in England were not liable for stamp duty, even before now. Many would be first-time buyers. Before the chancellor's announcement, first-time buyers paid no tax on properties up to Â£300,000 and 5% on any portion between Â£300,000 and Â£500,000. So the new stamp duty holiday would not benefit many of those young, new buyers directly. Those buying homes for more than Â£500,000, or second homes, will still have to pay stamp duty, but their total bill will be lower as a result of these changes. Mr Sunak will not pay to paint the kitchen, but there will be help with the cost of insulating your home, including double glazing, in England. In the scheme, which will start in September, the government will pay at least two-thirds of the cost of home improvements that save energy. This will be paid as a voucher when the work is approved. For example, a homeowner of a semi-detached or end-of-terrace house could install cavity wall and floor insulation for about Â£4,000 - the homeowner would pay Â£1,320 while the government would contribute Â£2,680. Low-income households could receive a bigger contribution.

"The chancellor's incentive scheme to persuade employers to keep on furloughed staff beyond October may not be enough to stem job losses. The furlough scheme will be replaced with a one-off Â£1,000 reward for each worker retained for three months, Rishi Sunak said in his summer statement. But employers' groups are warning more support may be needed to protect jobs. Trade Union leader Frances O'Grady described the scheme as a ""little tinkering around the edges"". The chancellor was widely praised for taking decisive action in March when he introduced the furlough scheme to protect jobs, which has supported nine million employees over the last three months. But there were concerns that firms would lay off workers as soon as government financial support was withdrawn, creating a ""cliff edge"" for jobs. In announcing the new Â£1,000 Job Retention Bonus, the chancellor said creating and protecting jobs was the ""most urgent challenge"" the government faced but said keeping workers on furlough would provide some employees with ""false hope"". Employers can receive a one-off payment of Â£1,000 for each furloughed employee who remains employed until the end of January 2021 The employee must earn above Â£520 per month on average over that period Payments will be made from February 2021 Further details will be announced by the end of July However, several organisations have expressed doubts that the scheme will be sufficient to protect the millions of jobs that hang in the balance. ""The chancellor is absolutely right to prioritise jobs,"" said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. She also welcomed the additional measures to create new jobs for young people, traineeships and apprenticeships. ""But prevention is better than cure. Many viable firms are facing maximum jeopardy right now,"" she added. ""With nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed."" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman, also welcomed the ""jobs first approach"" but questioned whether the retention scheme would work smoothly enough. ""The job retention bonus must be easy to access. We can't have paperwork holding up this vital support. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said the retention scheme might not provide a sufficient bridge for many firms coming off the furlough scheme. ""A little tweaking around the edges is not going to provide the plan we need for those industries that are critical for this country's future,"" she said. The government is offering a carrot if they hang on to workers. The government says it could cost up to Â£9bn - a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed workers multiplied by Â£1,000. Of course it won't be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and then over 20% in October - followed by three months of full wages to land a prize of Â£1,000 during the worst downturn in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in  the worst affected industries by cutting VAT and offering half price early bird food but it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that long. We also learned two other important things today. First that any idea of extending the furlough scheme - as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and business are realising just how much they need each other. So he is dangling his Â£1,000 carrot. The question is: is it big enough to save those jobs. Employers were aware that the furlough scheme was being wound down. Firms were told they would have to pay employees pension and National Insurance contributions in August and contribute some money towards staff pay in September and October as part of a flexible furlough scheme. Critics say at this stage many firms will already have decided to cut jobs rather than take on that extra burden. The think tank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the Â£1,000 was unlikely to be enough to persuade firms to keep on staff given the difficult economic environment. ""While the aim of the Summer Statement is laudable, the new measures look to be badly timed and could precipitate a rapid increase in unemployment,"" said Garry Young, NIESR Deputy Director. ""The incentives offered to employers look too small to be effective.  Many employers have been topping up the pay of furloughed workers and are expected to bear more of the cost of the scheme from next month.  They will be reluctant to do this now they know that the scheme won't be extended."" What happens when furlough ends?

"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted British sprinter Bianca Williams has received an apology from the Met Police after she and her partner were pulled over in their car in a stop-and-search. Ms Williams's three-month-old son was also in the car on Saturday when it was stopped in Maida Vale. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick told a committee of MPs officers had visited Ms Williams to apologise for ""distress"" caused by the stop. Ms Williams said police had apologised for the distress but not their actions. Footage of the stop-and-search has been shared widely on social media. Ms Williams believes officers racially profiled her and her partner Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese international 400m runner, because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. They say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? Met refers British sprinter stop-and-search Williams' 'heart hurts' after police stop car Despite two reviews by the force's directorate of professional standards, Dame Cressida said the force had found no misconduct by its officers. However, because of the public interest in the case, the Met has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 Earlier, Dame Cressida told the Home Affairs Select Committee: ""We apologised yesterday to Ms Williams and I apologise again for the distress this stop clearly caused her. ""I think all of us watching could empathise with somebody who is stopped in a vehicle, who has a young child in the back, who does not probably know what exactly is going on, and is subsequently found, together with her partner, not to be carrying anything illicit."" Dame Cressida said she has asked a senior officer to review the Met's handcuffing practices to make sure it hasn't become a ""default"", and has set up an ""oversight group"" looking at the use of force. ""Every time we see a video that is of concern we review them, we see if there are any lessons to be learned,"" she told MPs. Ina statement on Instagram,external, Ms Williams wrote that the couple welcomed the referral of the incident to the IOPC. She said: ""An independent investigation is now necessary, as the Metropolitan Police have proved that they cannot be trusted to investigate a complaint themselves, having already publicly stated that there has been 'no misconduct'."" ""We have now received an apology for the distress the incident caused us, but significantly, not for the wholly unjustified actons (sic) that officers took against our family. ""We are now contacting the IOPC through our lawyers and will assist fully with their investigation, which we hope will be rigorous,"" Ms Williams added. IOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said the IOPC would look at whether the use of stop and search was appropriate and proportionate in line with approved police policies, adding: ""We will also investigate if racial profiling or discrimination played a part in the incident."" By BBC Reality Check In 2018-19, police officers in England and Wales used handcuffs just over 300,000 times. Around 16% of those people cuffed were black. This means that, when we look at people who were handcuffed relative to their population in the 2011 Census, black people were roughly six times more likely to be handcuffed than white people. Not all people who get arrested are handcuffed and not all handcuffed people get arrested. However, the ratio of handcuffing to arrests shows a great discrepancy between black and white people: â¢ In 2018-19, 452,000 white people were arrested and 210,000 were handcuffed â¢ Over the same period, 60,000 black people were arrested and 49,000 were handcuffed Ch Supt Karen Findlay, who is in charge of the Territorial Support Group which conducted the stop, and local area commander Helen Harper, also informed Ms Williams about the IOPC referral and the next steps in the process. But Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball told the committee there had been ""good grounds"" for the car to be stopped and at that point the officers involved did not know who was in it. Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car Nothing was found in the search, which the Met said was carried out by officers patrolling the Maida Vale area in response to an increase in violence involving weapons. The force also said the vehicle was seen driving suspiciously, including on the wrong side of the road, and that the driver sped off when asked to stop. But this account was rejected by Ms Williams, who has said she is considering legal action against the Met. ""I feel very hurt by their actions, and to witness my partner being taken away and for me to be taken away from my son, my heart hurts,"" she said this week. The Bianca Williams incident has intensified the focus on the use of force by police in the UK, particularly by the Metropolitan Police. Figures published by the Home Affairs Committee suggest handcuff use in the Met has quadrupled in three years, from 5,559 instances in April and May 2017 to 25,251 over the same period this year. The statistics indicate the rise has been driven by a surge in handcuffing of ""compliant"" individuals. Scotland Yard says comparisons with earlier years aren't possible because the data are unreliable, but Dame Cressida Dick's decision to set up a review shows she's seeking reassurance that handcuffs haven't become the norm. The commissioner says she's also monitoring stop-and-search figures ""like a hawk"" and acknowledged concern that in one month alone, May, 8,200 searches of black boys and men aged 15-24 were carried out - without any weapon, stolen goods or drugs being found.

"June Wray had chronic pain after a vaginal mesh repair Many lives have been ruined because officials failed to hear the concerns of women given drugs and procedures that caused them or their babies considerable harm, saysa review,external. More than 700 women and their families shared ""harrowing"" details about vaginal mesh, pregnancy test Primodos and epilepsy drug sodium valproate. Too often worries and complaints were dismissed as ""women's problems"". It said arrogant attitudes left women traumatised, intimidated and confused. The patients who fought for answers 'No-one believed my pain' Review chair Baroness Julia Cumberlege said she was shocked by the ""sheer scale"" and ""intensity of suffering"". She said: ""I have conducted many reviews and inquiries over the years, but I have never encountered anything like this. ""Much of this suffering was entirely avoidable, caused and compounded by failings in the health system itself."" She said even now the exact numbers of women affected by the three issues was still not known and praised campaigners for fighting to raise the problems. The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and support organs The cases span decades and are thought to affect hundreds of thousands of women and babies. The review looked at three treatments: Primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test, withdrawn from the market in the 1978, which is thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages. The manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, has always denied a link between the drug and deformities in babies. Sodium valproate - an epilepsy drug which, while effective for preventing seizures, can be harmful if taken during pregnancy, causing physical abnormalities to the baby in the womb as well as developmental delay and autism in children whose mothers took it. Pelvic mesh implants - used as a surgical option to treat prolapse and incontinence, some women say they have been left with internal damage and agonising chronic pain ""like razors inside the body"". In the last few years, the procedure has only been offered on the NHS under exceptional circumstances and high vigilance. The mesh is made of a polypropylene, a type of plastic The review has set out the missed opportunities when something could or should have been done to prevent harm. It said there was a culture of denial by a disjointed and defensive healthcare system that failed to listen to patients' concerns. Hundreds of babies are being born each year to mothers ""unaware"" of the risks that sodium valproate can pose in pregnancy, said the review. While some women have benefited from mesh implants, others have been left in agony. Kate Langley, Marie Lyon and June Wray have all been affected June Wray, 73 and from Newcastle, experienced chronic pain after having a vaginal mesh procedure in 2009. ""Sometimes the pain is so severe, I feel like I will pass out,"" she said. ""But when I told GPs and surgeons, they didn't believe me. They just looked at me like I was mad."" Kate Langley had a mesh fitted in 2012 for incontinence problems. She said it had had a massive impact on her life, leading to more than 50 admissions to hospital when she was in acute pain. ""It was so hard to deal with. Years of going from one doctor to another."" She has now had four operations to remove the mesh. Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos when she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born with a shortened arm. She began campaigning in 1978 and said the review was a ""relief that there has finally been an acknowledgement"" of the situation. Mrs Lyon, chairwoman of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, said there was also ""great sadness"" that many of the original campaign members were not alive to see the result of the review. The review warned against pushing innovative treatments without enough long-term monitoring, and criticises manufacturers for being motivated by sales ahead of safety.

Below is a selection of
the key announcements -you
can read a full summary here- andhere's our news story.  The Chancellor serving customers in a central London restaurant. After his speech in the Commons, this afternoon Rishi Sunak visited a branch of the restaurant chain Wagamama in Central London. The chancellor chatted to customers, served them lunch and asked how they felt about being out and about after the lockdown. Speaking to the media afterwards the chancellor said, the government had been right to act ""in the way we have during this crisis"". ""Weâve stepped in, weâve limited long term damage. But in the medium term we will and must return to a position of financial sustainability."" Former chair of Pizza Express Luke Johnson has been speaking to Radio 4's PM programme. He says: âThese are extraordinary
announcements for a government to be making â¦ every bit is helpful."" On whether theAugust voucherswill work he says: âI think a lot of people are still frightened and so every
inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their
habits of eating and spending and working is good news. âI think the government must also help with its messaging
and communications â¦and start encouraging people, as they have in other
countries, to get back to a degree of usual behaviour and that will allow
businesses to survive and jobs to be maintained.â Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts says some of the chancellor's measures are welcome including support for young people getting into work. However she urges the government to look at extending furlough schemes for those sectors hard hit by the crisis such as tourism. She also says she would like to see furlough extended in those areas where a local lockdown is implemented. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says ""I fear - just as the government was slow to act on the health consequences they are being far too slow to respond to the economic consequences of Covid-19. ""Many of those who have been furloughed will soon be unemployed... I fear we are about to enter levels of mass unemployment."" He says Â£1,000 isn't enough for employers in various sectors that had their businesses closed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the government will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease. The opposition parties already suggest that the scale of what the government is proposing falls short of what will be required. Rishi Sunak admitted in his statement ""our plan will not be the last - it is the next"", knowing full well that the profound economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is far from passed.

Rishi Sunak has confirmed the
governmentâs furlough scheme will close in October. He
says this will be a ''difficult moment'' and that some jobs will not be
protected. The
scheme has been paying up to 80% of the wages of nine million people who canât work because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Furlough
was designed to help support employees and businesses in hard-hit sectors, and
prevent mass redundancies. Furloughed
employees can now go back to work part-time, and from August, employers will have to pay National Insurance
and pension contributions for their staff. In
September, they will have to pay 10% of their furloughed employees' salaries -
rising to 20% in October. There
are concerns there may be significant job losses when the scheme finishes, and
the chancellor has offered firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every furloughed employee
they keep on until the end of January, and pay at least Â£520 a month. Read
more about the rights of furloughed employeeshere. Clive Docwra, Managing Director
of construction consultancy McBains, said it is important to get the economy moving but that the ""long-term outlook is not great"". ""Many developers are hesitant about committing to new projects against a backdrop of coronavirus, and it's likely the government will need to provide ongoing support for some time to come â or, at the very least, until an effective treatment or vaccine is found,"" he says. However he welcomed measures such as theKickstart schemeand traineeship money which he said would ""give developers confidence
that returning to full operational capacity may well be a risk worth taking.â Reality Check During
his speech, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: âAnalysis
Iâm publishing today shows our interventions significantly protected peopleâs
incomes, with the least well off in society supported the most.â The
analysis does suggest that the lowest-paid benefited most - you can find the analysis documenthere.,external It
doesnât quite show the least well off âin societyâ being supported the most â
itâs only an analysis of households with a working member before coronavirus, so those relying on benefits or pensioner households are
not included. Also,
the analysis assumes that nobody will be paid more than the Â£2,500 maximum
offered by the furlough scheme (it ignores top-ups by employers) which means
high-earning furloughed households are bound to lose out more. For
example, somebody being furloughed who normally earned Â£5,000 a month would be
assumed to lose Â£2,500 a month in earnings, while somebody normally earning
Â£2,500 a month would only lose Â£500 a month â clearly in that model the lower
paid would be doing better. BBC Sounds What does todayâs summer statement mean for your job, your wages or your business? Let the#yourworkyourmoney,externalpodcast team answer your query, just post your question on social media including the hashtag. And listen via@bbcsounds,externalhttp://bbc.in/3iHz1XK,external Thomas Woollard hopes businesses will invest in young people on the new job placements Thomas Woollard is 21 years old and has begun the process of applying for Universal Credit. He plans to look into the Chancellor's placement scheme for young people in more detail. âIâd like to see if it would benefit me,"" he says. ""If I can get on to
the scheme and get some income from somewhere Iâll definitely consider it."" Thomas also wonders whether businesses will invest in the people on the scheme or just take the free labour the government is offering. He adds: âWill businesses see this as an investment in themselves, in the country and invest in young people or will they just take the paid work
they are given?"" James Storey is landlord of a small stand-alone pub in Gateshead. He says that the chancellor's plans won't help people like him. ""I run a small pub which is not linked to the major breweries. I won't benefit from the hospitality plans as we don't serve food. ""Also, due to social distancing rules, I only have 17 seats available on my premises. ""I originally had four staff prior to lockdown. Two are not coming back as they have new jobs in the NHS call centre. ""Many customers will continue to use cheap supermarket booze and drink in open spaces. ""There is nothing in this announcement for small local pubs"". Gina Broadhurst, co-founder of the ForgottenLtd Campaign for small limited company directors, said: ""It makes no sense for the government to reward companies for bringing employees back from furlough or creating new apprenticeships if those same companies are going out of business. She says ""hundreds of thousands of small business owners employing millions of people have received zero support and are on the verge of collapse."" ""For them, the chancellor's silence was deafening. While the cut in VAT for the hospitality industry is to be welcomed, as are the job creation and apprenticeship schemes, millions of small businesses are still missing out on support. Caroline Nokes, Chair of Women and Equalities Committee has welcomed the ""speedily delivered and far reaching"" measures in the chancellor's economic statement. But she said, ""the lack of focus on using his three-point plan to boost gender equality is a missed opportunity. ""There was no mention of helping businesses in sectors where women are disproportionately represented and which remain shut down, for example the beauty industry. ""It was disappointing to hear no mention of government support for the childcare sector, which predominantly employs women. We know that affordable, reliable childcare is key in enabling women to return to work and stay in work."" Our teams have been working on some guides to help make sense of what today's announcements means. Here's a round-up of our explainers: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Today's announcement is not just about trying to protect jobs but also encouraging employers who might still be having a very difficult time, to keep employees in work. The government also know that another huge package is not necessarily going to be enough to stop some people losing their jobs What they are trying to avoid is mass unemployment. This isn't the end of it - there's a question of how this is going to be paid for. All that is to come - and that could be a much more difficult day for the chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Rishi Sunak has just finished taking questions from MPs in the Commons. Chancellor cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government is offering a
carrot to businesses if they hang on to their workers. Â£1,000 for every worker who returns from
furlough who is still employed at the end of January. The government says it
could cost up to Â£9bn â a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed
workers multiplied by Â£1000. Of course it wonât be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to
start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and
then over 20% in October â followed by three months of full wages to land a
prize of Â£1,000 during the worst recession in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent
on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in the worst-affected industries by cutting VAT andoffering half-price early bird food, but
it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that
long. We also learned two other
important things today. First, that any idea of extending the furlough scheme â
as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and
business are realising just how much they need each other. These programmes are big and
challenging to deliver. Rishi Sunak said early on that today is not the last
intervention but the next intervention. The biggest question of all â the question that may determine the future of hundreds
of thousands of workers - is whether heâs made his carrot big enough. Labour's shadow justice's secretary David Lammy has tweeted his concern that law firms are not being supported. ""A Law Society survey of small firms in April found that 71% of small firms fear cashflow issues could force their closure within 6 months. ""But not a single word in the government's Plan for Jobs to protect them,"" he says. BlackRock, one of the world's largest pension and money managers, offers a gentle warning in what it describes as ""this blurring of monetary and fiscal policy"" as very low interest rates and big government spending take off, not just in the UK, but around the world. ""While there is little likelihood of material near-term
inflation, once we look out further into this decade, this blurring of monetary
and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks globally,"" said Vivek Paul, Chief Investment Strategist for
     the UK, BlackRock Investment Institute, the research wing of the firm. He says investors might consider looking at inflation-linked government bonds rather than the vanilla variety. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

"Attractions could, but might not, pass the VAT cut on to ticket prices A reduction in VAT might not cut the price of a family trip to the rollercoasters, but venues hope it may give their sector less of a rocky ride. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a temporary drop in the sales tax from 20% to 5% for attractions, meals and accommodation. A family ticket to the zoo of Â£144 could, in theory, become Â£18 cheaper. But experts predict many businesses will not cut prices, instead using the money to save their ailing businesses. The chancellor said the VAT rate on food, non-alcoholic drink, accommodation and attractions in the UK would be cut to 5% between 15 July and 12 January. In theory, the rate change could mean a couple buying a pub meal costing Â£45 without alcohol would save Â£5.62, while a Â£54.50 one-night stay at a hotel in a family room would see a saving of Â£6.81, according to accountants Deloitte. What is VAT and how does it work? What the chancellor's summer statement means for you Chancellor Rishi Sunak cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs In practice, venues may decide to keep prices the same, but keep the extra money they would have sent to the tax authority. Providers will not refund those who have booked and paid for accommodation later in the summer, because the rate is for when the sale was made. Many of these businesses find themselves on the brink, given they were closed for months during lockdown, and the Treasury believes that the choice should remain with these operators, rather than the government, on whether to pass on savings. Ministers may hope to get somewhere close to the reaction of a VAT cut in 2008, when eight in 10 firms said they passed it on, although that was a much more wide-ranging policy. This latest cut marks a move towards more targeted support for the worst-hit sectors of the economy. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, said: ""This [VAT change] doesn't mean we are out of the woods and there are still significant challenges ahead."" The biggest of these was the rent payments that many of these businesses still needed to pay, despite not having any income for weeks. The policy will mean many businesses in the hospitality sector will be operating on three different rates of the sales tax. Alcohol will see a 20% VAT rate, there is a 0% VAT rate on cold takeaway food, and everything else will now see a temporary 5% rate. This would add an extra administrative burden for the sector, said Alison Horner, from accountants MHA MacIntyre Hudson. There is concern, too, about the timing of the latest cut. Although the summer holidays mean many families will be free to visit attractions, they still may be nervous in doing so. They may be worried about coronavirus. They may not fancy the idea of booking days, or possibly weeks, in advance, as venues have reduced their capacity. They might not like the potential of having to queue at a social distance. If the venues themselves could not increase the number of customers owing to virus restrictions, then the VAT would just be a giveaway not targeted at those who were struggling, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Tax specialist ChasÂ Roy-Chowdhury argued that the chancellor could have delayed any VAT cuts until a vaccine was found and people returned to some kind of normality. This would give the UK economy some significant ""momentum"" at that time, he said, rather than a watered-down version now. Others, including many venues, would argue that without any stimulus now, many of these restaurants, cinemas or attractions simply would not survive until then.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's cut to the rate of value added tax (VAT) on hospitality and tourism from 20% to 5% has now started. It lasts until 31 March 2021 (it was originally due to end on 12 January, butthe period has been extended) and applies to food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Mr Sunak said the move is designed to""get the sectors moving and to protect jobs"",but what is VAT and how does it work? Value added tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things like children's car seats and home energy. The lower rate also currently applies to sanitary products, although in the March 2020 Budget, the government announcedit will stop charging VAT on these goods from 1 January 2021. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted in Marchthat VAT would raise Â£136.6bn in 2019-20.,external That is equivalent to around Â£4,800 per household and represents 16.8% of all the money the government receives from taxes. VAT accounts for around 6.2% ofGDP, the total value of goods and services produced in the economy. In 2018-19 VAT was the third biggest income generator for the UK government, after income tax and national insurance contributions. These three taxes togetherraise more than half of government tax receipts.,external For most families in the UK, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. You can see that in the dark green bars in the chart below. But poorer households tend to pay a bigger share of their taxes through taxes on spending: VAT and duties - the blue areas in each bar. Those are known as indirect taxes. For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax that is paid. The standard rate of VAT increased from 17.5% to 20% on 4 January 2011. In 2008, following the financial crash, the government introduced a temporary cut in the rate of VAT to 15%. The rate cut lasted from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009and cost the government Â£12.4bn in lost revenue.,external The aim of the cut was to boost consumer spending with retailers expected to pass the reduction on to customers. At the time, opinion was divided about the policy with then Conservative leader David Cameron calling it an ""unbelievable and expensive failure"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies was more supportive.It predicted a growth in sales of about 1%,externaland said a VAT cut compared well with other incentives. Measuring the overall impact proved challenging, because no-one could know what would have happened without the rate cut. Mr Sunak's six-month cut for hospitality and tourism is set to cost the government Â£4.1bn. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. For example, Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Britain,said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. And many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. However, Starbucks has said it will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. McDonald's has recommended that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, and pub chain Wetherspoon said it would reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks. The UK's VAT rate of 20% seems to be roughly in the middle when compared with European Union countries.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says travel quarantine arrangements will be reviewed on 20 July People travelling to and from Spain will still have to go into quarantine when arriving in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The Scottish government has approved almost all of the ""air bridge"" travel destinations set out by UK ministers. This means that from 10 July, Scots can travel to 57 other countries without having to self-isolate on returning. However, Spain and Serbia have been omitted from the list due to concerns about the prevalence of Covid-19. The first minister said this was a ""very difficult decision"" to make, but that it was needed to ""protect Scotland as far as possible from a resurgence of this virus in the weeks ahead"". And she warned that people should not seek to ""get around"" the restrictions by travelling via English airports, insisting that the rules ""are here for a reason"". Where can I take a foreign holiday this summer? The UK government had set out a list of 59 countries around the world which it said now pose a ""reduced risk"" from coronavirus, and which would no longer be subject to quarantine rules. These include most countries in Europe, island nations in the Caribbean and countries further east - including Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Nicola Sturgeon said cases entering Scotland from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"" Scottish ministers - who have the final say on public health arrangements north of the border - have now approved this list, but with two exceptions. Ms Sturgeon said the lower prevalence of the virus in Scotland meant its position was ""a bit different to that of the UK as a whole"". And she said that ""we cannot in good conscience lift restrictions"" for people arriving from Spain or Serbia. The first minister said this was ""the best balance we can arrive at"", and said she hoped the situation could be updated in the near future. The move means anyone entering Scotland from Spain or Serbia will have to go into self-isolation even if they travel via an English airport. Spot-checks are conducted on people who are meant to be in quarantine, and fines can be levied if it is found they are not. David Curran from Glasgow has an apartment in Majorca which he has not visited since October last year. He and his family have flights to the Spanish island on 21 July - and is confident they will go through with their plans - but says he believes there is ""no need"" for a quarantine. David told the BBC he does not believe holidaymakers from Scotland want staycations ""Nicola Sturgeon is getting information from scientists, but personally I think she's trying to turn it into a Scotland-England thing,"" he said. ""I'm still optimistic it'll be dropped by the time we come back, but it's as if she just wants people to have holidays in Scotland this year. ""But as she was saying that, my window wipers couldn't keep up with the rain - the majority of people in Scotland don't want to go on holiday in Scotland."" The Scottish government has targeted the effective elimination of coronavirus north of the border, and Ms Sturgeon said the importation of new cases from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"". She said it was estimated that for every 100,000 people in Scotland, 28 currently have coronavirus. She said this compared to 128 across the UK as a whole, and about 330 in Spain - a ""significantly higher prevalence"" of the virus. She said ministers had taken a ""very difficult decision"" to omit Spain and Serbia from the list, and that the move was ""evidence-driven and motivated only by a desire to protect Scotland as far as possible"". Economic impact of travel Â£79mTotal spend 205,000Visits 5thBiggest tourism market 6days average length of stay Figures from VisitScotland suggest Spain is Scotland's fifth largest market in terms of tourism visitors, with 205,000 visits recorded in 2018. The first minister said she knew Scots loved travelling to Spain and that Scottish businesses welcomed many Spanish tourists, adding that the position could change ""possibly very soon"". Ms Sturgeon also urged Scots to have a ""staycation"" this summer rather than going on holiday abroad. ""Remember that this is about trying to stop people getting a deadly and damaging virus and trying to minimise as far as possible any further loss of life,"" she said.

"The chancellor's summer statement will mean an extra Â£39m in public spending for Northern Ireland, Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said. He said other recent announcements, such as support for the arts, would add a further Â£116m to Stormont budgets. He also welcomed moves such as a hospitality VAT cut but said the overall package did not go far enough. ""The measures are not ambitious enough to spur economic recovery,"" Mr Murphy said. ""Covid-19 will continue to have a dramatic impact on our economy for some time to come. ""What is needed is a comprehensive stimulus package."" Mr Murphy was responding to a range of measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak to boost the hospitality and tourism industries. Themeasures announced on Wednesdayinclude a six-month cut in VAT from 20% to 5% for the hospitality and tourism sectors. Hospitality Ulster said the announcement was ""a welcome boost"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak announces cut to VAT Earlier, Mr Murphy urged the government to ease ""rigid fiscal rules"" in NI. The chancellor did not respond to that in his statement to the House of Commons, but outlined a number of other measures, including: Paying firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October A  scheme to give 50% off to people dining out in August A Â£2bn ""kickstart scheme"" to create more jobs for young people The package is designed to help prevent mass unemployment and help the economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitality and tourism have been particularly affected due to a huge decline in air travel and the introduction of social-distancing rules. Hospitality Ulster said the move comes at a time many in the industry were ""fearful for their future"" but will help to ""paint a brighter picture"". Bill Wolsey, whose portfolio includes Belfast's Merchant and Bullitt hotels and the Dirty Onion bar, welcomed the news. ""We have just had a 10% increase from breweries and food prices have gone up, so the cut in VAT will help us keep prices as they are,"" he said. ""The whole industry is doing their very best to make sure they don't make redundancies."" An end to NI's ""antiquated licensing laws"" would also boost ""an industry on its knees"", he added. Analysis by John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor The hospitality industry in Northern Ireland has pursued a long campaign for a VAT cut. This was mainly about bringing the sector into line with competitors in the Republic of Ireland who have been paying VAT at a much lower rate. Now the industry has its wish, but not in circumstances it could have ever imagined. Restaurants, pubs and other businesses face a huge battle for sustainable trading in an era of social distancing. The VAT cut will allow them to fund price promotions in an attempt to get people through the doors. Or alternatively many will simply pocket in the VAT saving in an attempt to keep their businesses above water. Colin Johnston, general manager of the Galgorm Resort, described the new measures as ""pretty much a game changer"". Howard Hastings, managing director of Hastings Hotels, said they would ""go a long way in helping the local economy recover"". Details of how the package will be paid for - through borrowing and possible tax rises - are likely to be unveiled in the chancellor's autumn budget. Mr Sunak also announced a temporary stamp duty holiday in Northern Ireland and England to stimulate the property market. This would exempt the first Â£500,000 of all property sales from the tax. The Westminster announcement comes as a Stormont committee heard the money generated by tourism in Northern Ireland is likely to drop from Â£1bn last year to Â£400m in 2020. Janice Gault, of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said in the medium term the sector hoped to ""get the GB market back"". But she said international visitor numbers were likely to be low over the summer. ""For us, we see the really difficult time of trading is going to be from September through to next March."" Joanne Stuart, of the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance, told the committee businesses believed it would take at least two to three years to recover from lockdown. She said it was ""critical to the survival of businesses over the winter period"" that they can maximise the rest of this year's season. ""What we now need to see is communication from our political leaders to encourage people to stay local and support local businesses this year,"" she said. Earlier, Mr Murphy,along with his Scottish and Welsh counterparts Kate Forbesand Rebecca Evans, made a call for greater financial flexibilityahead of the chancellor's statement. They said it would help them respond better to the coronavirus crisis. They want assurances that will give them the freedom to switch capital funding to day-to-day revenue. Mr Murphy, along with Kate Forbes and Rebecca Evans, made the call ahead of the Chancellor's summer statement The ministers also called for an end to the arbitrary limits on borrowing and more clarity on details around the forthcoming spending review. Mr Murphy said it was ""crucial"" that devolved administrations were ""equipped to respond swiftly and effectively to the challenges arising from Covid-19"". ""More financial flexibility can help us deal with these challenges and use our budgets to support public services, protect the vulnerable, and deliver an economic recovery,"" he said.

"Rishi Sunak presented his summer statement in the Commons on Wednesday The Welsh Government will get an extra Â£500m as a result of the chancellor's summer statement, the UK government has said. Rishi Sunak announced measures to help hospitality, tourism and young people in the Commons on Wednesday. Measures include cuts to VAT and discounts for eating out. But the Welsh Government said the announcement did not pull the ""levers needed to support"" the recovery from coronavirus. The UK government says it has provided Welsh ministers, who run many of Wales' public services including the NHS, with a total of Â£2.8bn during the pandemic. In the statement the chancellorannounced a 50% discount for dinersin August, and aVAT cut for hospitality and tourism from 20% to 5%. Both measures will apply in Wales, as will aÂ£2bn 'kickstart' schemeto create more jobs for young people. The decision to give employersÂ£1,000 per staff member they take back from the furlough schemeis also UK-wide. But a temporary stamp duty holiday on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales applies to England and Northern Ireland.In Wales stamp duty is devolved. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said through the crisis the UK government has ""supported hundreds of thousands of people in Wales, putting in place one of the largest and most comprehensive economic responses in the world"". 'Apprentices have been overlooked' What are Welsh rates of stamp duty? Face masks 'not a magic bullet' to stop virus The measures led to calls from the UK government for ministers in Cardiff to go further in relaxing lockdown. UK government Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""The opportunities we are creating and the new routes into employment are great news for young people in Wales, while VAT cut for tourism and hospitality will be a huge boost for that sector. ""It is now absolutely essential that Wales' world-class tourism and hospitality industry can properly open for business."" Currently no date is set for pubs, cafes and restaurants to reopen indoors in Wales, although plans are for them to use outdoor spaces from 13 July. Outdoor attractions have been allowed to reopen with the lifting of travel restrictions last Monday, and self-contained accommodation is also expected to open from 13 July. A cut to the Welsh version of stamp duty has not been ruled out The UK government announcement on stamp duty prompted requests for the same in Wales, where the charge is called land transaction tax (LTT). It is not levied for properties sold in Wales worth Â£180,000 and lower. Estate agent Morris, Marshall and Poole with Norman Lloyd, said such a cut would ""stimulate the local market"", while the Home Builders Federation said cutting LTT would ""increase industry confidence and encourage investment"". Wales' finance minister Rebecca Evans did not rule out matching the stamp duty holiday, saying she would consider the implications of the announcements over the ""next day or so"". Ms Evans said it was ""really surprising that the chancellor had very little to say today about public services, health, social care"" and local government, calling for more cash to ""reopen healthcare more widely"". She added the youth employment scheme looked ""very much indeed"" like the Welsh Government's part-EU funded Jobs Growth Welsh scheme, which she said had helped 20,000 into employment since 2012. The 'kickstart' fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24, who are at risk of long-term unemployment, while Jobs Growth Wales offers firms subsidies for six-month job opportunities. Ms Evans denied that the restaurant discount would put more pressure on the Welsh Government to reopen indoor hospitality. ""I think what we really want to see is the evidence which tells us that it is safe to increase the opportunities for those hospitality businesses to open,"" she added. Rebecca Evans has called for more flexibility in how the Welsh Government spends money The UK government said the summer statement confirmed ""an additional Â£500m of Covid-19 funding for the Welsh Government through the Barnett formula"". The Welsh Government has seen its budgets rise since the Covid-19 crisis began - the UK government said it has now provided Â£2.8bn extra cash. Under the Barnett system, public spending in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland increases or decreases according to how spending in England rises or falls. Welsh public services are mostly funded by UK governments grants, with a small amount of revenue from Welsh Government taxation in Wales added on. The last Welsh Government supplementary budget in May for coronavirus said ministers in Cardiff were spending Â£22bn in 2020/21. Plaid Cymru said the UK government had not learned the lessons from the start of the coronavirus crisis, and did not announce any measures to support the next stage of the pandemic, such as local lockdowns. Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless welcomed the chancellor's statement: ""We would encourage Welsh Government to cut stamp duty here too, but there is not much point while they still ban most property viewings. It's time for a UK wide approach."" The Welsh Government said it is awaiting ""full clarity on what this announcement means for Wales but we do know that it did not pull the macro levers needed to support the recovery"". ""It ignored the joint calls from devolved nations to ease the rigid fiscal rules that limit our response and made only a passing reference to public services"". Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans, together with counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, has called for the rules to be loosened so devolved governments can borrow more.

"The Chancellor has said his package of measures aimed at limiting the economic impact of coronavirus are ""absolutely vital"" for Scotland. Rishi Sunak said many rural areas of Scotland would particularly benefit from a cut to VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector. And he said Scotland would now receive a total of Â£4.6bn in additional Barnett funding from the UK government. The figure had been put at Â£3.8bn by the UK government before his statement. The Scottish government welcomed parts of Mr Sunak's announcement, but accused him of showing a lack of ambition by not introducing the Â£80bn stimulus package it had called for. Many of the measures unveiled by Mr Sunak will apply in Scotland, including the ""job retention bonus"" that will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for at least three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. What does mini-budget mean for Scotland? Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Sunak cuts VAT on hospitality to 'save jobs' VAT on food, accommodation and attractions will be cut across the UK from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. The cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs, accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites, attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos. Mr Sunak also unveiled a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out across the UK in August. And he announced aÂ£2bn ""kickstart"" schemeto help create more jobs for young people which will cover Scotland, England and Wales. The chancellor's speech, as expected, was all about jobs with billions of pounds to stem looming unemployment. For a Conservative government these are big spending interventions, perhaps more natural territory for Labour or the SNP. It's certainly no easy balancing act for a relatively new chancellor. He wants to give people hope but he certainly isn't sugar-coating it. Despite calls to extend the furlough scheme, it was a no. An admission some jobs will never come back, shifting the focus on getting employers to hire people who have been furloughed through bonuses. The chancellor was also keen to flash his unionist credentials early on. The UK government will be aware of a series of polls suggesting support for independence growing during the pandemic. So the chancellor stressed the ""special bond"" of the union and the support people in devolved nations received. However, his announcement of a temporary stamp duty holiday in England to stimulate the property market will not apply in Scotland unless the Scottish government matches the move through its equivalentLand and Buildings Transaction Tax.,external The Chancellor told the Commons that the UK government remained ""absolutely committed"" to its goal of ""levelling up in every part of the country"". He added: ""I am pleased to tell the House that the sum total of Barnett funding for Scotland as a result of all the interventions through this crisis now totals Â£4.6bn, which is going to support similar measures in Scotland as we are providing elsewhere. ""The measures I announced today - the jobs retention bonus for furloughed employees, the Kickstart scheme, the VAT cut, the eat out to help out discount - are all incredibly significant interventions and all of them benefit the entire United Kingdom."" Mr Sunak also stressed the importance of tourism to the Scottish economy, particularly in rural and coastal areas, and said that the VAT and eating out measures would be ""absolutely vital in driving the growth of Scotland going forward again"". He added: ""Again, they are a reminder to everyone - we are stronger together, one United Kingdom"". The UK government says measure it has previously introduced, such as the furlough scheme, have ""protected more than 620,000 jobs, thousands of businesses and paid Â£425m to self-employed people"" in Scotland. Kate Forbes says she needs additional borrowing powers to help Scotland's economic recovery from the pandemic The Scottish government had called on the Chancellor to show ""greater ambition in the level of investment in our economy"" by introducing an Â£80bn stimulus package. Its finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said that Mr Sunak's commitment to economic recovery ""appears to be less than half of that with no apparent increase in capital infrastructure"". She added: ""We called for an Â£80bn stimulus package to build a strong, green and inclusive economic recovery and while there are elements in this announcement to be welcomed, in particular the measures on VAT for tourism and hospitality, overall this package is a huge opportunity missed. ""It falls well short of delivering what is needed to boost the economy and protect jobs. ""There is no new capital spend, no extension to the furlough scheme for hard-hit sectors and no further support for households in financial difficulty. A half-price meal out does not help those struggling to put food on the table."" Ms Forbes made a request to be allowed to borrow Â£500m this year and to be given the flexibility to reallocate any unused capital funding on day-to-day spending in a letter to the Treasury two weeks ago. She has argued that the ""relatively limited"" changes would ""ease some of the immense pressures on our budget"" caused by the coronavirus crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time that he would consider the request - but there was no mention of it in the Chancellor's statement.

"Young people across the UK have had their work, studies and lives upended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many are working from home, while others have been furloughed or even made redundant. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So what did they think ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's speech on Wednesday? Emma-Jayne is an apprentice chef from Dorset, earning Â£5 per hour. She is one of the many workers who were furloughed in the hospitality sector. The scheme was introduced by the government to minimise coronavirus-related job losses, and it pays 80% of staff salaries up to Â£2,500 a month. Although restaurants in England have since been allowed to reopen, Emma-Jayne has only gone back to work part-time. Sunak to give firms Â£1,000 cash bonus to hire trainees UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days While the chancellor announced that firms in England will receive cash bonuses for hiring new apprentices from 1 August, Emma-Jayne feels she's being ""overlooked"". ""I've only just been able to pay my rent and bills on furlough payments,"" she says. ""As well as the business receiving that bonus, the apprentice should get something to support them."" She also expressed concern aboutthe government giving diners 50% off their food bills in August. ""The voucher is all well and good if the UK was clear of Covid-19, but it's not. ""Hospitality desperately needs a boost. But in that same breath, the last thing any business needs is for their staff or customers to be put at risk of infection."" Nairn McDonald, 24, is a full-time carer for his mum and 21-year-old brother. He says that during lockdown they've been shielding. ""Now they can't get out, my role has changed. I'm also picking up prescriptions, doing more errands - so it's a bit more labour intensive."" Costs have also been adding up. Nairn relies on universal credit, the benefit for working-age people in the UK, which he says doesn't ""really go a long way"". As part of his speech on Wednesday, the chancellor announced the ""kickstart"" plan, which will subsidise six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on universal credit, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. Nairn points out that it's crucial that the scheme is ""flexible"" for carers. He also worries about the type of work to be subsidised. ""I was so happy to be the first in my family to go to university. I wanted to get a decent job with a decent wage, but it's not clear what's on offer with the scheme. ""There's also no way that I could think of employment if the risk of bringing Covid-19 back to my household is quite high."" Razzia Gafur, 24, moved to London after finishing her university studies two years ago. But when lockdown started, she decided to isolate with her partner and his family just outside of Leeds. ""I only packed a weekend bag, and I've been here for three to four months now!"" Razzia has since asked her estate agent if she could exit the tenancy agreement, as she's spending Â£700 per month on rent and bills on a property she hasn't been living in. ""They would only let me out of my tenancy if I found a replacement tenant,"" Razzia says, adding that it was difficult to find anyone to take on the flat during lockdown. She wanted the chancellor to do more for tenants in the private rented sector. ""To be honest, I can't say I'm disappointed because I didn't expect any help from the government,"" she says. ""It's definitely solidified the thought that I should be looking to buy my own property, as renting has put me in a more difficult situation."" She adds that that government should use lockdown as an opportunity to educate first-time buyers about the different types of schemes that exist to help them get on the housing ladder. Although the chancellor announceda stamp duty holiday for property salesup to Â£500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, first-time buyers pay no tax up to Â£300,000. Georgia Barks from Peterborough has also been furloughed. The theatre she works at has been closed since the pandemic took hold earlier this year. While the government has announced a Â£1.57bn emergency support packageto help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums, ""it should have been done sooner"", Georgia says. ""When we all looked for entertainment during lockdown, we turned to Netflix, we turned to TV, and to theatre live-streams - we all turned to the arts."" Georgia believes that the chancellor should have extended the furlough scheme,which is due to finish at the end of October, covering costs for theatres which have no confirmed reopening date as of yet. ""There are no shows for people to come see and there is a drop in future bookings because people are waiting to see if dates get moved again. ""It's ridiculous to say [theatres] must contribute when they have no income to do so,"" she says.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Two-time world champion snowboarder Alex Pullin has died while spearfishing in his native Australia, local officials have confirmed. Pullin, 32, was found unresponsive off a beach on Queensland's Gold Coast on Wednesday. He was treated by paramedics at the scene but could not be revived, authorities said. Nicknamed ""Chumpy"", Pullin was Australia's flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. A Queensland Ambulance spokesman said: ""The man was spearfishing off Palm Beach. He was brought to shore by bystanders where he was treated by local lifesavers and paramedics."" A snorkeler had spotted Pullin unconscious underwater on an artificial reef, local media said. Lifeguards brought him to shore and called paramedics about 10:30 local time (00:30 GMT). A police official told Australia's Channel 9 News that Pullin appeared to have been diving alone. ""He didn't have an oxygen mask, we understand he was free diving and spearfishing out on the reef,"" Officer Chris Tritton said. The athlete had previously shared pictures online of himself spearfishing, swimming and surfing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The sport's Australian top body, Snow Australia, said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by Pullin's death. ""Alex was a beloved member of the Snow Australia community and he will be dearly missed,"" it said in a statement. ""An incredible athlete, beloved teammate and role model, you will be sorely missed,"" the Australian Olympic Team, which Pullin had been part of three times, said. The chief executive of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia, Geoff Lipshut, described the athlete as ""one of our great winter sports pioneers"". He told Reuters news agency that Pullin had retired from snowboarding last month but had not announced the decision before his death. Pullin was the flagbearer for Australia at the 2014 Games Other athletes and commentators have also paid tribute, with many describing him as a kind and generous person. ""The world will miss such a talented human and a double world champion without ego and without selfishness who is everyone's best mate,"" wrote former Australian speed skater Steven Bradbury. Pullin, who grew up in the town of Mansfield, Victoria, first learned to snowboard when he was eight years old, going on to win  world championship titles in 2011 and 2013. He also represented Australia in snowboard cross at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 Olympics.

As we reported earlier, VP Mike Pence has been holding a press briefing, where he confirmed the US has passed 3 million cases of the virus. He's downplayed a threat from President Trump over schools reopening, saying the White House would be ""very respectful"" of states and communities who decide they can't fully open their schools. ""We're here to help,"" Mr Pence - a former governor of Indiana - told reporters. ""We don't want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance. We're here to assist with the shared objective, which I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back. We want to get them back in the classroom."" His tone was markedly different to that of President Trump, who earlier today threatened to cut off funding to schools that don't open in the autumn. He also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines for reopening schools were ""very tough and expensive"". Allow Twitter content?

Schools in the US normally begin the year in either August or early September. The CDC's guidelines suggest pupils and staff all wear face coverings and stay at home if necessary. They also suggest schools should implement staggered timetables and socially distanced seating arrangements, and close communal spaces. However Mr Pence said the agency would be issuing new guidelines soon. The US has the highest number of infections, and the highest death toll, in the world. The Visual and Data Journalism Team The World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged there is ""emerging evidence"" that Covid-19 could be spread through particles in the air. It comes aftermore than 200 scientists wrote an open letter to the agencyurging officials to recognise the possibility of airborne transmission of the virus.

Ishaq KhalidBBC News, Abuja Passengers are required to wear face masks at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja Domestic passenger flights have resumed in Nigeria more
than three months after they were suspended as part of measures to contain the
coronavirus pandemic. Airports in the capital Abuja and the commercial hub
Lagos have begun operating again, while other airports across the
country will follow in the coming days. A number of measures have been put in place to check the
spread of the coronavirus - including disinfecting passengersâ luggage and footwear, mandatory wearing of face mask at airports, washing of hands before entry
into the terminal building and social distancing. Authorities also say only
passengers are allowed into the terminal building and they must arrive at least
three hours before their flight. The reopening of the airports for domestic flights is
part of the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions to help bring the
economy back to life. However, international flights remain suspended until
further notice. The number of coronavirus cases in Nigeria continues to rise sharply
daily. The country has recorded 29,879 cases of the virus, 12,108 recoveries
and 669 deaths. We reported earlier that the US has passed 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Vice President Mike Pence has just confirmed this at a press conference, and added that more than 130,000 people had died. Removing his mask to address reporters, Pence went on to defend President Trump's handling of the pandemic. He said the latest wave of cases seemed to be flattening out. ""While we mourn with those who mourn, because of what the American people have done, because of the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers around the country, we are encouraged that the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady,"" he said.

Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease. The opposition parties already suggest that the scale of what the government is proposing falls short of what will be required. Rishi Sunak admitted in his statement ""our plan will not be the last - it is the next"", knowing full well that the profound economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is far from passed.

More than 131,000 people in the US have now died with Covid-19. The UK death toll for those who have tested positive for coronavirus has risen by 126 to 44,517, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The below charts show the figures - and trends in the numbers - in more detail. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg Gauteng is expected to be the next coronavirus epicentre South Africa now has the 14th highest number of Covid-19 infections globally and officials are concerned it is spreading rapidly. More than 10,000 new infections and 192 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours. The Western Cape has the most cases currently, with just over 72,000 infections. But Guateng, the countryâs economic hub, is set to become the new epicentre of the disease in the next few days. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, chairperson of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory committee, said the virus was spreading fastest in Gauteng for two reasons: The province has the highest traffic of foreign and domestic employees, and Gauteng also has the highest population density. Although the re-opening of more industries is deemed necessary to save the economy, the government has asked South Africans to continue taking precautions to help slow down the spread of the virus. At least 3,470 people in South Africa have died from the disease. The National Gallery has reopened its doors to the public. The London gallery has become the first of the major UK art institutions to reopen as coronavirus restrictions are eased. Visitors to the gallery will follow one-way routes and any visit must be booked in advance. Two-metre social distancing rules are in place and visitors are being encouraged to wear face coverings. The gallery's Titian exhibition has reopened - after being forced to close in March, three days into its run. ""People are desperate for some good news and some places to go and, frankly, I think that the arts are very important in people's wellbeing,"" said the gallery's director, Gabriele Finaldi. ""We're very keen to be part of that recovery process."" Diners in Melbourne after the first lockdown was eased last month Melbourne is now officially in lockdown, again, for six weeks, after a surge in cases of coronavirus. People in the city, where it's now the early hours of 9 July, are barred from leaving their homes other than in very specific circumstances, such as work, exercise and shopping for food. Schools will largely return to distance learning and restaurants will only be permitted to serve takeaway food, although hairdressers will remain open. Before heading indoors for a month and a half, many Melburnians went out for dinner and drinks, while others had their friends over for a final hurrah. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Stewart says: ""As the chancellor made clear this is just the next step in our recovery programme."" Further measures will be brought in at the right point he says and the Â£30bn announced today comes on top of all the other measures the UK government has announced already, he says. The UK government  minister encourages the first minister now to do all she can to make sure the tourism and hospitality sectors don't suffer a ""three winter period"" in Scotland. Mr Stewart argues that the""eat out to help out"" discountwill help the sector return. On the Scottish government announcementon air bridges,he says he has not seen any evidence to suggest Spain as a whole is not safe to travel to. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes says today'spackage of measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunakgives the Scottish government ""neither the powers nor the funding to tailor our response to the Scottish economyâ. ""Whilst there are
elements we welcome, particularly the focus on jobs, and the temporary cut to
VAT, my hopes have certainly been dashed because it would appear a lot of the substantial
decisions have been delayed until the autumn,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. Of the Â£30bn announced, the
Scottish government will only receive Â£21m, she says, which is ""less than 0.1%"". Ms Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had called for an Â£80bn package equivalent to 4% of GDP, as is happening in Germany. ""The
Â£30bn today doesnât even come to half of that,"" points out the finance secretary, who said she - along with counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland - has asked the Treasury on Tuesday for ""minor fiscal flexibilities"" to allow the devolved nations to
respond individually. ""Essentially todayâs announcement
bypasses devolution completely and doesnât provide that funding or the powers,â Ms Forbes added. A total of 4,173 Scots
deaths have been linked to Covid-19 as of 5 July, official figures show. TheNational Records of Scotland (NRS) figures,externalindicate that is an increase of 17 deaths from
the previous week. From 29 June to 5 July, 40 fewer deaths from all causes were registered compared with the average number for this time of year. New analysis of deaths registered up to 14 June shows that deaths among people from the South Asian ethnic group were almost twice as likely to involve Covid-19 than deaths in the White ethnic group, after accounting for age group, sex, area deprivation and urban/rural classification. The NRS weekly figures are higher than the daily figure announced by Nicola Sturgeon because they include all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested.

Ryanair's terms state that if you suffer from a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a face mask, you are exempted ""on provision of a medical certificate attesting your condition.â But her doctor is currently refusing to provide her with one, based on Scottish government guidance that an exemption letter is not required. ""I thought I would get into the habit because I would be wearing one for five to six hours, but when I tried one on in the shop, it just made
me feel very panicky,"" the woman told BBC Scotland's Drivetime. ""I have felt claustrophobic before, but have never had a panic attack. This was just
awful. Now the thought of putting it on makes me feel so anxious."" She says he has already experienced ""funny stares"" from people when travelling by train without a face mask and worries she will feel similarly ""alienated"" if she gets permission to fly.

The move to ease quarantine rules from Friday means Scots can travel to a number of countries without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, although Spain is not included on the list. Ken McNabb, managing director of the Travel Company Edinburgh says it is a ""major step forward"" for those in the travel industry. ""I appreciate Spain has had a surge in coronavirus cases, as has Serbia, so there is just cause to leave these out,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland ""Moving people into these countries [on the approved list] is fine, we've got a lot of people we can cover. ""I'm quite sure the majority of travel agencies around the country will be whooping and shouting with joy. We've got this door opened to get people away."" So people travelling to and from Spain will still have to go into quarantine when arriving in Scotland. However the Scottish government has approved almost all of the ""air bridge"" travel destinations set out by UK ministers. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports which owns and
manages Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said: âTodayâs announcement means airlines
can now start making decisions on what flights they will operate, however, the
glaring omission is Spain which accounts for 60% of our leisure flights. âWeâve requested a meeting with
the Scottish government to discuss what further measures could be put in place
that would allow the lifting of restrictions and prevent airlines from
cancelling routes to what is one of Scotlandâs most popular and important
tourism destinations.â From Friday, travellers are exempt from quarantine rules when they arrive in Scotland from: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Croatia, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan The Vatican City made the list but Spain and Serbia did not Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, RÃ©union, San Marino, Seychelles, South Korea, St BarthÃ©lemy, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Pierre and Miquelon, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Vatican City, Vietnam. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Barry McCulloch, the senior policy advisor for the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, thinks overall he got what he wanted from Rishi Sunak. Mr McCulloch tells Drivetime: ""I think overall it struck the right chord and provided some good news that has been in short supply for three months."" The chancellor announcedan ""eat out to help out"" scheme which offers a 50% discount for every diner, up to Â£10 a head, from Monday to Wednesday throughout August. Gino Stornaiuolo, who owns a couple of Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which will participate in the scheme says: ""This is going to further encourage people to hopefully come out and dine."" Mr Stornaiuolo says if his restaurants can do a bit more business from Monday to Wednesday that will be a great help. In response to the six-month VAT cut for restaurants, hotels and attractions, the restaurateur says: ""I'll take any VAT cut."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So what has the reaction been to the chancellor's announcements around Scotland? Alan Henderson, who owns several pubs, restaurants and a hotel in Aberdeen. tells Drivetime: ""Clearly it's great news for the hospitality sector. ""We're probably the sector that's suffered as much as anyone."" Mr Henderson says: ""It's a real shot in the arm and I totally endorse the chancellor's comments, the hospitality sector employs a lot of young people."" He applauds the chancellor's efforts to create and keep jobs for the young. Rishi Sunak The Chancellor has said his package of measures aimed at limiting the economic impact of coronavirus are ""absolutely vital"" for Scotland. Rishi Sunak said many rural areas of Scotland would particularly benefit from a cut to VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector. And he said Scotland would now receive a total of Â£4.6bn in additional Barnett funding from the UK government. The figure had been put at Â£3.6bn by the UK government before his statement. The Scottish government welcomed parts of Mr Sunak's announcement, but accused him of showing a lack of ambition by not introducing the Â£80bn stimulus package it had called for. Many of the measures unveiled by Mr Sunak will apply in Scotland, including the ""job retention bonus"" that will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for at least three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland ""At least we have clarity,"" says travel agent Shona Thorne on the Scottish government's publication of countries from where travellers will be exempt from quarantine rules. She does express surprise at Spain not being included, telling BBC Radio Scotland: ""That caught most of us out."" Ms Thorne believes airlines will avoid any knee-jerk reaction since the list is to be reviewed again on 20 July and flights will not resume in earnest until 15 July. ""There are lots of questions around quarantine,"" she explains. ""We're asking customers to be patient in the short term."" It is also important to remember that there are several nations on the list that UK residents cannot enter presently - or will be subject to testing or quarantine on arrival, she stresses.

"Olalekan Jacob Ponle, known as ""mrwoodbery"" to his Instagram followers, flaunted his wealth The day after his 29th birthday in May, Olalekan Jacob Ponle posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to a bright yellow Lamborghini in Dubai. ""Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you've acquired,"" he admonished, wearing designer jewellery and Gucci clothes from head to toe. A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name ""mrwoodbery"" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, ""hushpuppi"" or just ""hush"" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (Â£32m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims.

Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,"" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC. It is a spectacular crash for the two Nigerian men who extensively documented their high-flying lifestyle on social media, raising questions about the sources of their wealth. They unwittingly provided crucial information about their identities and activities for American detectives with their Instagram and Snapchat posts. They are accused of impersonating legitimate employees of various US companies in ""business email compromise"" (BEC) schemes and tricking the recipients into wiring millions of dollars into their own accounts. On Instagram, hushpuppi said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called ""Flexing"" - social media lingo for showing off. But the ""houses"" were actually a codeword for bank accounts ""used to receive proceeds of a fraudulent scheme"", investigators allege. ""Our value system in Nigeria needs to be checked, especially the emphasis we place on wealth, no matter how you got it,"" the economist Ebuka Emebinah told the BBC from New York. ""It's a culture where people believe that results speak for you. We don't place as much emphasis on the process and this has built up over time."" In April, hushpuppi renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number. ""Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,"" he captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just a fortnight before he was arrested. ""Abbas finances this opulent lifestyle through crime, and he is one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitates computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes (including BEC schemes), and money laundering, targeting victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said in an affidavit.

In one case, a foreign financial institution allegedly lost $14.7m in a cyber-heist where the money ended up in hushpuppi's bank accounts in multiple countries. The affidavit also alleged that he was involved in a scheme to steal $124m from an unnamed English Premier League team. The FBI obtained records from his Google, Apple iCloud, Instagram and Snapchat accounts which allegedly contained banking information, passports, communication with conspirators and records of wire transfers. About 90% of business email compromise scams originate in West Africa, research from American email security firm Agari shows. The complaint against Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle describe tactics that resemble what the company calls Vendor Email Compromise tactics, where scammers compromise an email account and study communication between a customer and a vendor. ""The scammer would gather contextual details, as they watched the legitimate email flow,"" explains Crane Hassold, Agari's senior director of threat research. ""The bad actor would redirect emails to the bad actor's email account, craft emails to the customer that looked like they are coming from the vendor, indicate that the 'vendor' had a new bank account, provide 'updated' bank account information and the money would be gone, at that point."" Mr Ponle, known online as ""mrwoodberry"", used Mark Kain in emails, according to the FBI. He is accused of defrauding a Chicago-based company into sending wire transfers of $15.2m. Companies in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and California are also said to have fallen victim. The cash trail allegedly disappeared after his accomplices, called money mules, converted the money into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Email scams have become so prevalent globally, and so deeply linked to Nigeria, that the fraudsters have a name in the country: ""Yahoo boys"". They try to convince a recipient to wire money to the other side of the world or they go ""phishing"", stealing a user's identity and personal information for fraud. The FBI warns against the Nigerian letter or ""419"" fraud - emails promising large sums of money, called advance fee scams. The ""Nigerian prince"" trope has become shorthand for deception. An individual may contact you via e-mail, explaining he needs help to transfer money Will tell you that political turmoil or a natural disaster makes it difficult for him to make the transfer Will ask you to give him your financial details so that he can transfer the money into your account This allows him to access and steal from your account Be careful what you post on social media and dating sites as scammers use the details to better understand you and target you A Washington, DC-based attorney, Moe Odele, finds it frustrating as a Nigerian because it ignores the ""systemic failures that have led to brilliant Nigerian youths engaging in these scams"", in the country and abroad. ""They see it as an easy way out in a country that offers them limited options and, in many cases, no options at all,"" she says. ""But there are also many brilliant Nigerians are represented in world stages from education to pop culture."" Last month, the US Treasury Department blacklisted six Nigerians among 79 individuals and organisations in its Most Wanted cybercriminals list. It accused them of stealing more than $6m from American citizens through deceptive global threats like BEC and romance fraud.

""A lot of Nigerians are doing fantastic things all over the world, but they don't get as much media mileage as the guys doing bad things. It affects all the guys doing legitimate stuff especially in the tech space,"" he said. ""A lot of foreign companies don't ship to Nigeria, many payment platforms don't accept payments from us because it has ruined our image."" In its internet crime report for 2019,external, the FBI said it had received more than 460,000 complaints of suspected cyber fraud, with losses of more than $3.5bn reported. More than $300m was recovered, it said. However, many online fraudsters don't get caught and even fewer end up going to jail. Mr Donath says the cases are challenging because they happen overseas and tend to be quite sophisticated. ""They're time-consuming, highly document-intensive, and in many federal criminal cases, you have the difficulty of walking a jury through a chronology of relevant facts,"" said the partner at law firm Clifford Chance. If convicted, Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle could be locked up for up to 20 years.

"Olalekan Jacob Ponle, known as ""mrwoodbery"" to his Instagram followers, flaunted his wealth The day after his 29th birthday in May, Olalekan Jacob Ponle posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to a bright yellow Lamborghini in Dubai. ""Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you've acquired,"" he admonished, wearing designer jewellery and Gucci clothes from head to toe. A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name ""mrwoodbery"" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, ""hushpuppi"" or just ""hush"" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (Â£32m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims.

Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,"" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC. It is a spectacular crash for the two Nigerian men who extensively documented their high-flying lifestyle on social media, raising questions about the sources of their wealth. They unwittingly provided crucial information about their identities and activities for American detectives with their Instagram and Snapchat posts. They are accused of impersonating legitimate employees of various US companies in ""business email compromise"" (BEC) schemes and tricking the recipients into wiring millions of dollars into their own accounts. On Instagram, hushpuppi said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called ""Flexing"" - social media lingo for showing off. But the ""houses"" were actually a codeword for bank accounts ""used to receive proceeds of a fraudulent scheme"", investigators allege. ""Our value system in Nigeria needs to be checked, especially the emphasis we place on wealth, no matter how you got it,"" the economist Ebuka Emebinah told the BBC from New York. ""It's a culture where people believe that results speak for you. We don't place as much emphasis on the process and this has built up over time."" In April, hushpuppi renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number. ""Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,"" he captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just a fortnight before he was arrested. ""Abbas finances this opulent lifestyle through crime, and he is one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitates computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes (including BEC schemes), and money laundering, targeting victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said in an affidavit.

In one case, a foreign financial institution allegedly lost $14.7m in a cyber-heist where the money ended up in hushpuppi's bank accounts in multiple countries. The affidavit also alleged that he was involved in a scheme to steal $124m from an unnamed English Premier League team. The FBI obtained records from his Google, Apple iCloud, Instagram and Snapchat accounts which allegedly contained banking information, passports, communication with conspirators and records of wire transfers. About 90% of business email compromise scams originate in West Africa, research from American email security firm Agari shows. The complaint against Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle describe tactics that resemble what the company calls Vendor Email Compromise tactics, where scammers compromise an email account and study communication between a customer and a vendor. ""The scammer would gather contextual details, as they watched the legitimate email flow,"" explains Crane Hassold, Agari's senior director of threat research. ""The bad actor would redirect emails to the bad actor's email account, craft emails to the customer that looked like they are coming from the vendor, indicate that the 'vendor' had a new bank account, provide 'updated' bank account information and the money would be gone, at that point."" Mr Ponle, known online as ""mrwoodberry"", used Mark Kain in emails, according to the FBI. He is accused of defrauding a Chicago-based company into sending wire transfers of $15.2m. Companies in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and California are also said to have fallen victim. The cash trail allegedly disappeared after his accomplices, called money mules, converted the money into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Email scams have become so prevalent globally, and so deeply linked to Nigeria, that the fraudsters have a name in the country: ""Yahoo boys"". They try to convince a recipient to wire money to the other side of the world or they go ""phishing"", stealing a user's identity and personal information for fraud. The FBI warns against the Nigerian letter or ""419"" fraud - emails promising large sums of money, called advance fee scams. The ""Nigerian prince"" trope has become shorthand for deception. An individual may contact you via e-mail, explaining he needs help to transfer money Will tell you that political turmoil or a natural disaster makes it difficult for him to make the transfer Will ask you to give him your financial details so that he can transfer the money into your account This allows him to access and steal from your account Be careful what you post on social media and dating sites as scammers use the details to better understand you and target you A Washington, DC-based attorney, Moe Odele, finds it frustrating as a Nigerian because it ignores the ""systemic failures that have led to brilliant Nigerian youths engaging in these scams"", in the country and abroad. ""They see it as an easy way out in a country that offers them limited options and, in many cases, no options at all,"" she says. ""But there are also many brilliant Nigerians are represented in world stages from education to pop culture."" Last month, the US Treasury Department blacklisted six Nigerians among 79 individuals and organisations in its Most Wanted cybercriminals list. It accused them of stealing more than $6m from American citizens through deceptive global threats like BEC and romance fraud.

""A lot of Nigerians are doing fantastic things all over the world, but they don't get as much media mileage as the guys doing bad things. It affects all the guys doing legitimate stuff especially in the tech space,"" he said. ""A lot of foreign companies don't ship to Nigeria, many payment platforms don't accept payments from us because it has ruined our image."" In its internet crime report for 2019,external, the FBI said it had received more than 460,000 complaints of suspected cyber fraud, with losses of more than $3.5bn reported. More than $300m was recovered, it said. However, many online fraudsters don't get caught and even fewer end up going to jail. Mr Donath says the cases are challenging because they happen overseas and tend to be quite sophisticated. ""They're time-consuming, highly document-intensive, and in many federal criminal cases, you have the difficulty of walking a jury through a chronology of relevant facts,"" said the partner at law firm Clifford Chance. If convicted, Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle could be locked up for up to 20 years.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Two-time world champion snowboarder Alex Pullin has died while spearfishing in his native Australia, local officials have confirmed. Pullin, 32, was found unresponsive off a beach on Queensland's Gold Coast on Wednesday. He was treated by paramedics at the scene but could not be revived, authorities said. Nicknamed ""Chumpy"", Pullin was Australia's flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. A Queensland Ambulance spokesman said: ""The man was spearfishing off Palm Beach. He was brought to shore by bystanders where he was treated by local lifesavers and paramedics."" A snorkeler had spotted Pullin unconscious underwater on an artificial reef, local media said. Lifeguards brought him to shore and called paramedics about 10:30 local time (00:30 GMT). A police official told Australia's Channel 9 News that Pullin appeared to have been diving alone. ""He didn't have an oxygen mask, we understand he was free diving and spearfishing out on the reef,"" Officer Chris Tritton said. The athlete had previously shared pictures online of himself spearfishing, swimming and surfing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The sport's Australian top body, Snow Australia, said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by Pullin's death. ""Alex was a beloved member of the Snow Australia community and he will be dearly missed,"" it said in a statement. ""An incredible athlete, beloved teammate and role model, you will be sorely missed,"" the Australian Olympic Team, which Pullin had been part of three times, said. The chief executive of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia, Geoff Lipshut, described the athlete as ""one of our great winter sports pioneers"". He told Reuters news agency that Pullin had retired from snowboarding last month but had not announced the decision before his death. Pullin was the flagbearer for Australia at the 2014 Games Other athletes and commentators have also paid tribute, with many describing him as a kind and generous person. ""The world will miss such a talented human and a double world champion without ego and without selfishness who is everyone's best mate,"" wrote former Australian speed skater Steven Bradbury. Pullin, who grew up in the town of Mansfield, Victoria, first learned to snowboard when he was eight years old, going on to win  world championship titles in 2011 and 2013. He also represented Australia in snowboard cross at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 Olympics.

"Diners will get a 50% discount off their restaurant bill during August under government plans to bolster the embattled hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the ""eat out to help out"" discount as part of a series of measures to restart the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The deal means people can get up to Â£10 off per head if they eat out from Monday to Wednesday. Mr Sunak also said VAT on hospitality and tourism would drop to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. As he announced the discount, the chancellor said the UK was facing a ""unique moment"" because of Covid-19, adding: ""We need to be creative."" What the summer economic plan means for your money Pubs and restaurants reopened on Saturday after more than three months in lockdown, withsafety measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Mr Sunak sought to reassure the public that it was safe to dine out. ""I know people are cautious about going out. But we wouldn't have lifted the restrictions if we didn't think we could do so, safely,"" he said. The discount will not apply to alcohol, but to food and soft drinks up to Â£10 per person. The Treasury said the 50% discount can be used unlimited times during August and applies to participating restaurants, cafÃ©s, and pubs across the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sunak said the plan was aimed at getting ""customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs"" and protecting ""the 1.8 million people who work in them"". However, the scheme prompted criticism from some who questioned subsidising meals out while British people continue to die from the coronavirus and many people are struggling financially. Businesses that want to take part in the scheme will have to register through a website that opens on Monday 13 July. Mr Sunak said: ""Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days."" He added that the cut in VAT, from 20% to 5%, would apply to ""eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs; accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites [and] attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos"". The lower tax rate will be implemented next Wednesday, 15 July, and will remain in place until 12 January 2021. Caroline Roylance, owner of The George pub at Fordingbridge, Hampshire, said she would be applying for the ""eat out to help out"" scheme. The pub reopened on Wednesday after being closed since 23 March, when the coronavirus lockdown was implemented. Pub-owner Caroline Roylance said the measures will help her business ""through the next few months"" She said the discount and the VAT cut ""will help us make it through the next few months, because trade is unlikely to return to pre-Covid levels for some time"". ""Saying that, it's been surprisingly busy today, which is encouraging, but it's still not July busy,"" said Mrs Roylance. ""It's a start though."" UK Hospitality, the trade body which represents the industry, ""warmly"" welcomed the moves, as well as Mr Sunak's plans to stem unemployment through schemes such ascreating thousands of job placements for young people. However, UK Hospitality's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""This doesn't mean we are out of the woods and there are still significant challenges ahead. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK is facing a ""unique moment"" ""The biggest of these is the spectre of rent liabilities, which many businesses are still facing from their closure period. We are going to need government support on this before too long."" Meanwhile, the exclusion of alcohol from the ""eat out to help out"" discount hit some pub groups' share prices. Mitchells & Butler's share price jumped by 7.3% to 175p towards the end of Mr Sunak's statement, when he revealed the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure industries, as well as the dining out discount. But once it became clear it did not include alcohol, Mitchell & Butler's share price fell ""just as quickly as it spiked up"", said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Marston's share price also dropped 6.1% to 48.98p. JD Wetherspoon's share price fell 2% to 986p.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22.

The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home.

In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We cannot lose this generation"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to cut VAT on hospitality as part of a Â£30bn plan to prevent mass unemployment as the economy is hit by coronavirus. The government will also pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. And Mr Sunak announced a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out in August. The chancellor warned ""hardship lies ahead"", but vowed no-one will be left ""without hope"", in a statement to MPs. He told MPs he will cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. It came as the latest death toll for coronavirus, in all settings,increased by 126 to 44,517.,external Chancellor unveils coronavirus recovery plan Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Labour said the chancellor's plans did not go far enough and the job retention money should be better targeted to prevent it going to firms that were already planning to bring staff back. ""We were promised a 'New Deal', but what we got was a 'Meal Deal',"" the party added. Mr Sunak rejected calls to extend the furlough scheme beyond October, saying it would give people ""false hope"" that they will have a job to return to, and ""the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade"". Sunak says economic measures 'vital' for Scotland 'Â£500m extra for Wales' from chancellor statement Hospitality and tourism measures welcomed in NI He conceded that jobs would be lost but said he would ""never accept unemployment as an inevitable outcome"" of the pandemic. Details of how the package will be paid for - through borrowing and possible tax rises - are likely to be unveiled in the chancellor's Autumn Budget. ""Over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing,"" he told MPs, adding that the jobs plan was merely the next stage ""in our fight to recover and rebuild after coronavirus"". The ""job retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9.4bn if every furloughed worker is brought back. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak chats to customers and serves a few meals to highlight his VAT rate cut to help the hospitality trade Explaining how it will work, the chancellor said: ""If you're an employer and you bring back someone who was furloughed - and continuously employ them through to January - we'll pay you a Â£1,000 bonus per employee. ""It's vital people aren't just returning for the sake of it - they need to be doing decent work. ""So for businesses to get the bonus, the employee must be paid at least Â£520 on average, in each month from November to the end of January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance."" What is VAT and how is it changing? The VAT cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, cafes and pubs, accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites, and attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos. Rishi Sunak said this ""Â£4bn catalyst"" would help protect ""over 2.4 million jobs"". The Treasury said it hoped firms would pass the VAT savings on to customers but many had been without income for months so it would be their decision. The VAT cut is aimed at boosting theme parks and other attractions Mr Sunak also announced an ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount, which he said would help protect 1.8 million jobs, at  a cost of Â£0.5bn. Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off in August, up to a maximum discount of Â£10 per head for everyone, including children. Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a website, which will open next Monday. Luke Johnson, former chairman of the Pizza Express, among other restaurant businesses, told BBC Radio 4's PM the chancellor understood the challenges facing the hospitality sector. Asked if the voucher scheme would work, he said: ""I think a lot of people are still frightened and so every inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their habits of eating and spending and working is good news."" The chancellor also announced a Â£2.1bn ""kickstart scheme"" to create more jobs for young people. The fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. A temporary stamp duty holiday, costing Â£3.8bn, to stimulate the property market was another measure unveiled by the chancellor. This will exempt the first Â£500,000 of all property sales from the tax, from midnight. A few other pledges released in the build-up to his statement included: Vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements as part of a widerÂ£3bn plan to cut emissions A pledge to provide30,000 new traineeships for young people in England AÂ£1.6bn packagefor the arts and heritage sector The doubling of front line staff at job centres, as well as an extra Â£32m for recruiting extra careers advisers and Â£17m for work academies in England Labour's shadow chancellor Annaliese Dodds told the BBC she was ""concerned"" the UK looks ""set to be breaking the previous unfortunate record of three million people unemployed"". She said job support should be better targeted to help struggling sectors. Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: ""The job retention bonus will help firms protect jobs, but with nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed."" Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the newly self-employed and company directors had ""once again been overlooked"". The National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned that the chancellor's ""badly timed"" measures ""could trigger a rapid rise in unemployment"". The think tank said he was ending the furlough scheme too early and the bonuses for employers to bring staff back ""look too small to be effective"". The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for, for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease.

"Young people across the UK have had their work, studies and lives upended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many are working from home, while others have been furloughed or even made redundant. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So what did they think ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's speech on Wednesday? Emma-Jayne is an apprentice chef from Dorset, earning Â£5 per hour. She is one of the many workers who were furloughed in the hospitality sector. The scheme was introduced by the government to minimise coronavirus-related job losses, and it pays 80% of staff salaries up to Â£2,500 a month. Although restaurants in England have since been allowed to reopen, Emma-Jayne has only gone back to work part-time. Sunak to give firms Â£1,000 cash bonus to hire trainees UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days While the chancellor announced that firms in England will receive cash bonuses for hiring new apprentices from 1 August, Emma-Jayne feels she's being ""overlooked"". ""I've only just been able to pay my rent and bills on furlough payments,"" she says. ""As well as the business receiving that bonus, the apprentice should get something to support them."" She also expressed concern aboutthe government giving diners 50% off their food bills in August. ""The voucher is all well and good if the UK was clear of Covid-19, but it's not. ""Hospitality desperately needs a boost. But in that same breath, the last thing any business needs is for their staff or customers to be put at risk of infection."" Nairn McDonald, 24, is a full-time carer for his mum and 21-year-old brother. He says that during lockdown they've been shielding. ""Now they can't get out, my role has changed. I'm also picking up prescriptions, doing more errands - so it's a bit more labour intensive."" Costs have also been adding up. Nairn relies on universal credit, the benefit for working-age people in the UK, which he says doesn't ""really go a long way"". As part of his speech on Wednesday, the chancellor announced the ""kickstart"" plan, which will subsidise six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on universal credit, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. Nairn points out that it's crucial that the scheme is ""flexible"" for carers. He also worries about the type of work to be subsidised. ""I was so happy to be the first in my family to go to university. I wanted to get a decent job with a decent wage, but it's not clear what's on offer with the scheme. ""There's also no way that I could think of employment if the risk of bringing Covid-19 back to my household is quite high."" Razzia Gafur, 24, moved to London after finishing her university studies two years ago. But when lockdown started, she decided to isolate with her partner and his family just outside of Leeds. ""I only packed a weekend bag, and I've been here for three to four months now!"" Razzia has since asked her estate agent if she could exit the tenancy agreement, as she's spending Â£700 per month on rent and bills on a property she hasn't been living in. ""They would only let me out of my tenancy if I found a replacement tenant,"" Razzia says, adding that it was difficult to find anyone to take on the flat during lockdown. She wanted the chancellor to do more for tenants in the private rented sector. ""To be honest, I can't say I'm disappointed because I didn't expect any help from the government,"" she says. ""It's definitely solidified the thought that I should be looking to buy my own property, as renting has put me in a more difficult situation."" She adds that that government should use lockdown as an opportunity to educate first-time buyers about the different types of schemes that exist to help them get on the housing ladder. Although the chancellor announceda stamp duty holiday for property salesup to Â£500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, first-time buyers pay no tax up to Â£300,000. Georgia Barks from Peterborough has also been furloughed. The theatre she works at has been closed since the pandemic took hold earlier this year. While the government has announced a Â£1.57bn emergency support packageto help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums, ""it should have been done sooner"", Georgia says. ""When we all looked for entertainment during lockdown, we turned to Netflix, we turned to TV, and to theatre live-streams - we all turned to the arts."" Georgia believes that the chancellor should have extended the furlough scheme,which is due to finish at the end of October, covering costs for theatres which have no confirmed reopening date as of yet. ""There are no shows for people to come see and there is a drop in future bookings because people are waiting to see if dates get moved again. ""It's ridiculous to say [theatres] must contribute when they have no income to do so,"" she says.

"Diners will get a 50% discount off their restaurant bill during August under government plans to bolster the embattled hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the ""eat out to help out"" discount as part of a series of measures to restart the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The deal means people can get up to Â£10 off per head if they eat out from Monday to Wednesday. Mr Sunak also said VAT on hospitality and tourism would drop to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. As he announced the discount, the chancellor said the UK was facing a ""unique moment"" because of Covid-19, adding: ""We need to be creative."" What the summer economic plan means for your money Pubs and restaurants reopened on Saturday after more than three months in lockdown, withsafety measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Mr Sunak sought to reassure the public that it was safe to dine out. ""I know people are cautious about going out. But we wouldn't have lifted the restrictions if we didn't think we could do so, safely,"" he said. The discount will not apply to alcohol, but to food and soft drinks up to Â£10 per person. The Treasury said the 50% discount can be used unlimited times during August and applies to participating restaurants, cafÃ©s, and pubs across the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sunak said the plan was aimed at getting ""customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs"" and protecting ""the 1.8 million people who work in them"". However, the scheme prompted criticism from some who questioned subsidising meals out while British people continue to die from the coronavirus and many people are struggling financially. Businesses that want to take part in the scheme will have to register through a website that opens on Monday 13 July. Mr Sunak said: ""Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days."" He added that the cut in VAT, from 20% to 5%, would apply to ""eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs; accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites [and] attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos"". The lower tax rate will be implemented next Wednesday, 15 July, and will remain in place until 12 January 2021. Caroline Roylance, owner of The George pub at Fordingbridge, Hampshire, said she would be applying for the ""eat out to help out"" scheme. The pub reopened on Wednesday after being closed since 23 March, when the coronavirus lockdown was implemented. Pub-owner Caroline Roylance said the measures will help her business ""through the next few months"" She said the discount and the VAT cut ""will help us make it through the next few months, because trade is unlikely to return to pre-Covid levels for some time"". ""Saying that, it's been surprisingly busy today, which is encouraging, but it's still not July busy,"" said Mrs Roylance. ""It's a start though."" UK Hospitality, the trade body which represents the industry, ""warmly"" welcomed the moves, as well as Mr Sunak's plans to stem unemployment through schemes such ascreating thousands of job placements for young people. However, UK Hospitality's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""This doesn't mean we are out of the woods and there are still significant challenges ahead. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK is facing a ""unique moment"" ""The biggest of these is the spectre of rent liabilities, which many businesses are still facing from their closure period. We are going to need government support on this before too long."" Meanwhile, the exclusion of alcohol from the ""eat out to help out"" discount hit some pub groups' share prices. Mitchells & Butler's share price jumped by 7.3% to 175p towards the end of Mr Sunak's statement, when he revealed the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure industries, as well as the dining out discount. But once it became clear it did not include alcohol, Mitchell & Butler's share price fell ""just as quickly as it spiked up"", said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Marston's share price also dropped 6.1% to 48.98p. JD Wetherspoon's share price fell 2% to 986p.

"Olalekan Jacob Ponle, known as ""mrwoodbery"" to his Instagram followers, flaunted his wealth The day after his 29th birthday in May, Olalekan Jacob Ponle posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to a bright yellow Lamborghini in Dubai. ""Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you've acquired,"" he admonished, wearing designer jewellery and Gucci clothes from head to toe. A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name ""mrwoodbery"" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, ""hushpuppi"" or just ""hush"" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (Â£32m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims.

Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,"" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC. It is a spectacular crash for the two Nigerian men who extensively documented their high-flying lifestyle on social media, raising questions about the sources of their wealth. They unwittingly provided crucial information about their identities and activities for American detectives with their Instagram and Snapchat posts. They are accused of impersonating legitimate employees of various US companies in ""business email compromise"" (BEC) schemes and tricking the recipients into wiring millions of dollars into their own accounts. On Instagram, hushpuppi said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called ""Flexing"" - social media lingo for showing off. But the ""houses"" were actually a codeword for bank accounts ""used to receive proceeds of a fraudulent scheme"", investigators allege. ""Our value system in Nigeria needs to be checked, especially the emphasis we place on wealth, no matter how you got it,"" the economist Ebuka Emebinah told the BBC from New York. ""It's a culture where people believe that results speak for you. We don't place as much emphasis on the process and this has built up over time."" In April, hushpuppi renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number. ""Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,"" he captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just a fortnight before he was arrested. ""Abbas finances this opulent lifestyle through crime, and he is one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitates computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes (including BEC schemes), and money laundering, targeting victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said in an affidavit.

In one case, a foreign financial institution allegedly lost $14.7m in a cyber-heist where the money ended up in hushpuppi's bank accounts in multiple countries. The affidavit also alleged that he was involved in a scheme to steal $124m from an unnamed English Premier League team. The FBI obtained records from his Google, Apple iCloud, Instagram and Snapchat accounts which allegedly contained banking information, passports, communication with conspirators and records of wire transfers. About 90% of business email compromise scams originate in West Africa, research from American email security firm Agari shows. The complaint against Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle describe tactics that resemble what the company calls Vendor Email Compromise tactics, where scammers compromise an email account and study communication between a customer and a vendor. ""The scammer would gather contextual details, as they watched the legitimate email flow,"" explains Crane Hassold, Agari's senior director of threat research. ""The bad actor would redirect emails to the bad actor's email account, craft emails to the customer that looked like they are coming from the vendor, indicate that the 'vendor' had a new bank account, provide 'updated' bank account information and the money would be gone, at that point."" Mr Ponle, known online as ""mrwoodberry"", used Mark Kain in emails, according to the FBI. He is accused of defrauding a Chicago-based company into sending wire transfers of $15.2m. Companies in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and California are also said to have fallen victim. The cash trail allegedly disappeared after his accomplices, called money mules, converted the money into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Email scams have become so prevalent globally, and so deeply linked to Nigeria, that the fraudsters have a name in the country: ""Yahoo boys"". They try to convince a recipient to wire money to the other side of the world or they go ""phishing"", stealing a user's identity and personal information for fraud. The FBI warns against the Nigerian letter or ""419"" fraud - emails promising large sums of money, called advance fee scams. The ""Nigerian prince"" trope has become shorthand for deception. An individual may contact you via e-mail, explaining he needs help to transfer money Will tell you that political turmoil or a natural disaster makes it difficult for him to make the transfer Will ask you to give him your financial details so that he can transfer the money into your account This allows him to access and steal from your account Be careful what you post on social media and dating sites as scammers use the details to better understand you and target you A Washington, DC-based attorney, Moe Odele, finds it frustrating as a Nigerian because it ignores the ""systemic failures that have led to brilliant Nigerian youths engaging in these scams"", in the country and abroad. ""They see it as an easy way out in a country that offers them limited options and, in many cases, no options at all,"" she says. ""But there are also many brilliant Nigerians are represented in world stages from education to pop culture."" Last month, the US Treasury Department blacklisted six Nigerians among 79 individuals and organisations in its Most Wanted cybercriminals list. It accused them of stealing more than $6m from American citizens through deceptive global threats like BEC and romance fraud.

""A lot of Nigerians are doing fantastic things all over the world, but they don't get as much media mileage as the guys doing bad things. It affects all the guys doing legitimate stuff especially in the tech space,"" he said. ""A lot of foreign companies don't ship to Nigeria, many payment platforms don't accept payments from us because it has ruined our image."" In its internet crime report for 2019,external, the FBI said it had received more than 460,000 complaints of suspected cyber fraud, with losses of more than $3.5bn reported. More than $300m was recovered, it said. However, many online fraudsters don't get caught and even fewer end up going to jail. Mr Donath says the cases are challenging because they happen overseas and tend to be quite sophisticated. ""They're time-consuming, highly document-intensive, and in many federal criminal cases, you have the difficulty of walking a jury through a chronology of relevant facts,"" said the partner at law firm Clifford Chance. If convicted, Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle could be locked up for up to 20 years.

"The 13-year-old was hit on the pavement in Old Road A 13-year-old boy is fighting for his life after being hit by a car as he walked along the pavement. The driver and passenger of the Jaguar failed to stop following the crash in Wigan at about 16:30 BST on Tuesday, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. The boy is thought to have been walking along Old Road in Ashton-in-Makerfield when the car hit him and then a wall. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He remains in custody for questioning, said a GMP spokesperson. A nearby wall was damaged after it was struck by the car The 13-year-old sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition. Old Road was closed for about six hours while police investigated but has since reopened. Sgt Darren Hancock appealed for witnesses and dash-cam footage.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We cannot lose this generation"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to cut VAT on hospitality as part of a Â£30bn plan to prevent mass unemployment as the economy is hit by coronavirus. The government will also pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. And Mr Sunak announced a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out in August. The chancellor warned ""hardship lies ahead"", but vowed no-one will be left ""without hope"", in a statement to MPs. He told MPs he will cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. It came as the latest death toll for coronavirus, in all settings,increased by 126 to 44,517.,external Chancellor unveils coronavirus recovery plan Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Labour said the chancellor's plans did not go far enough and the job retention money should be better targeted to prevent it going to firms that were already planning to bring staff back. ""We were promised a 'New Deal', but what we got was a 'Meal Deal',"" the party added. Mr Sunak rejected calls to extend the furlough scheme beyond October, saying it would give people ""false hope"" that they will have a job to return to, and ""the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade"". Sunak says economic measures 'vital' for Scotland 'Â£500m extra for Wales' from chancellor statement Hospitality and tourism measures welcomed in NI He conceded that jobs would be lost but said he would ""never accept unemployment as an inevitable outcome"" of the pandemic. Details of how the package will be paid for - through borrowing and possible tax rises - are likely to be unveiled in the chancellor's Autumn Budget. ""Over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing,"" he told MPs, adding that the jobs plan was merely the next stage ""in our fight to recover and rebuild after coronavirus"". The ""job retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9.4bn if every furloughed worker is brought back. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak chats to customers and serves a few meals to highlight his VAT rate cut to help the hospitality trade Explaining how it will work, the chancellor said: ""If you're an employer and you bring back someone who was furloughed - and continuously employ them through to January - we'll pay you a Â£1,000 bonus per employee. ""It's vital people aren't just returning for the sake of it - they need to be doing decent work. ""So for businesses to get the bonus, the employee must be paid at least Â£520 on average, in each month from November to the end of January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance."" What is VAT and how is it changing? The VAT cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, cafes and pubs, accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites, and attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos. Rishi Sunak said this ""Â£4bn catalyst"" would help protect ""over 2.4 million jobs"". The Treasury said it hoped firms would pass the VAT savings on to customers but many had been without income for months so it would be their decision. The VAT cut is aimed at boosting theme parks and other attractions Mr Sunak also announced an ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount, which he said would help protect 1.8 million jobs, at  a cost of Â£0.5bn. Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off in August, up to a maximum discount of Â£10 per head for everyone, including children. Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a website, which will open next Monday. Luke Johnson, former chairman of the Pizza Express, among other restaurant businesses, told BBC Radio 4's PM the chancellor understood the challenges facing the hospitality sector. Asked if the voucher scheme would work, he said: ""I think a lot of people are still frightened and so every inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their habits of eating and spending and working is good news."" The chancellor also announced a Â£2.1bn ""kickstart scheme"" to create more jobs for young people. The fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. A temporary stamp duty holiday, costing Â£3.8bn, to stimulate the property market was another measure unveiled by the chancellor. This will exempt the first Â£500,000 of all property sales from the tax, from midnight. A few other pledges released in the build-up to his statement included: Vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements as part of a widerÂ£3bn plan to cut emissions A pledge to provide30,000 new traineeships for young people in England AÂ£1.6bn packagefor the arts and heritage sector The doubling of front line staff at job centres, as well as an extra Â£32m for recruiting extra careers advisers and Â£17m for work academies in England Labour's shadow chancellor Annaliese Dodds told the BBC she was ""concerned"" the UK looks ""set to be breaking the previous unfortunate record of three million people unemployed"". She said job support should be better targeted to help struggling sectors. Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: ""The job retention bonus will help firms protect jobs, but with nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed."" Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the newly self-employed and company directors had ""once again been overlooked"". The National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned that the chancellor's ""badly timed"" measures ""could trigger a rapid rise in unemployment"". The think tank said he was ending the furlough scheme too early and the bonuses for employers to bring staff back ""look too small to be effective"". The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for, for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease.

"Fast fashion brand Boohoo has ordered an independent review of its UK supply chain following reports of poor working conditions at a factory in Leicester. It comes after retailers Next and Asos dropped Boohoo goods from their stores amid claims workers were underpaid and not socially distancing. The firm is also facing calls for a boycott on social media. Boohoo, which said it was ""appalled"" by the allegations, has asked a senior barrister to lead the review. It comes after a Sunday Times report claimed workers at a Leicester factory that supplied clothes to Boohoo were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. The factory was also said to be operating during a localised lockdown designed to stop a spike in Covid-19 cases in Leicester. Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, has separately claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were ""forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". Boohoo said it took ""extremely seriously all allegations of malpractice, poor working conditions, and underpayment of workers"". It said that Alison Levitt, a senior barrister who specialises in business crime, would lead an investigation looking into whether the company's suppliers pay the minimum wage, and comply with coronavirus safety regulations, working hours rules and immigration law. Big problem at Leicester factories, say workers Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando Boohoo swoops again to snap up Oasis and Warehouse brands It will also spend an initial Â£10m ""to eradicate supply chain malpractice"", with the help of audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas. The brand is popular with young women in particular, who it targets with marketing campaigns using Instagram ""influencers"" including contestants from the reality TV show Love Island . That strategy could be in question, as the company was criticised on platforms including Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag boycottboohoo. Allow Twitter content?

However, shares in the firm have dropped by almost half this week, diving 23% on Wednesday alone. The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in Manchester in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane. Before the Sunday Times' investigation the business was valued at about Â£5bn.

"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home. Calculate how much LBTT you will have to pay,external In Wales the current standard rates forLand Transaction Tax,external(LTT) are: Â£0-Â£225,000 = 0% Â£225, 001-Â£400,000 = 6% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 7.5% Â£750,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m + = 12% Purchasers usually have to pay the higher rate of LTT if they: buy a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and already own one or more other properties The higher rates of LTT are: Â£0-Â£180,000 = 4% Â£180,001-Â£250,000 = 7.5% Â£250,001-Â£400,000 = 9% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 11.5% Â£750,0001-Â£1,500,000 14% Â£1.5m + = 16% Calculate how much LTT you will have to pay,external You have 14 days to pay stamp duty from the date of completion in England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

'Rishi Sunak: We need help with rent, money and jobs' The fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. The chancellor will present the plans to Parliament on Wednesday Mr Sunak told Wednesday's cabinet meeting he wanted to protect as many jobs as possible and support the further opening-up of the economy. The CBI praised the scheme as ""a much-needed down payment in young people's futures"" and unions said it was ""a good first step"". Under the temporary stamp duty freeze, the first Â£500,000 of all property sales would be exempt from the tax, in England and Northern Ireland. A temporary VAT cut to help the hospitality sector, which has been hit hard in the pandemic, has also been predicted The chancellor has already outlined a number of other measures in the build-up to his statement, including: Vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements as part of a widerÂ£3bn plan to cut emissions A pledge to provide30,000 new traineeships for young people in England, giving firms Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer AÂ£1.6bn package of loans and grantsfor the arts and heritage sector The doubling of front line staff at job centres, as well as an extra Â£32m for recruiting extra careers advisers and Â£17m for work academies in England Employers will not have to pay any tax on coronavirus swab tests provided for their staff For each ""kickstarter"" job, the government will cover the cost of 25 hours' work a week at the National Minimum Wage - Â£4.55 for under 18s, Â£6.45 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and Â£8.20 for 21 to 24-year-olds. Employers will be able to top up that payment if they wish. The government said it would allow young people ""the opportunity to build their skills in the workplace, and to gain experience that will improve their chances of going on to find long-term sustainable work"". The scheme will open for applications in August, with the first jobs expected to start in the autumn, and run until December 2021 - with the option of being extended. It will cover England, Scotland and Wales, and the government said it would provide additional funding to Northern Ireland for a similar scheme. But Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also calling for fiscal rules to be relaxed to allow themto borrow more and spend unused capital fundingto address the ""monumental challenges"" of the economy. The government is looking now to the second phase of the crisis, when the worst stage of the health aspect has passed and they hope the economic recovery can begin. But job losses have begun, with barely a day going by without an announcement from a household name they are shedding staff. The reality is many of those who have been paid by the Treasury will find their job doesn't return. The focus of the chancellor's statement, therefore, will be ""jobs, jobs, jobs"", insiders say. There will certainly be a long list of proposals from the Treasury. It's not a small matter to do something like cut stamp duty, cut VAT in some sectors, accelerate infrastructure spending, or provide Â£2bn to subsidise jobs for young people. But they are certainly much more orthodox actions than the kind of drastic steps the Treasury took at the start of this crisis. Read more analysis from Laura Kuenssberg here. The chancellor has previously acknowledged young people could be the worst-affected by the crisis when it comes to employment, as they are the age group most likely to be on the government's furlough scheme -which is set to end in October. Already, between the start of lockdown in March and May, the number of people aged 24 and under claiming Universal Credit rose by 250,000 to almost 500,000. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the kickstarter scheme ""should help many young people to access work"" but said the government had not yet done enough to address the threat of mass unemployment. She called on it to extend the furlough and self-employed schemes, and create ""tailored support"" for older people or those living in hard-hit areas. The acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the chancellor was right to be helping young people but the ""scale of support is just not good enough"". And the SNP is calling for the job retention scheme to be extended as long as all four nations of the UK need it. The director-general of the CBI, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, said the announcement could see the government ""lessening the potential scarring impact of the pandemic for the next generation"". But she said businesses and the government needed to ""work to deliver the kickstarter scheme simply and at speed"", adding: ""There can be no time lost in preparing young people who are entering one of the toughest jobs markets we've seen in decades."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the scheme would ""encourage employers to take on those most at risk"" during this crisis but it could result in ""creating jobs which aren't really jobs"" or push other people out of work. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, welcomed the support for young people but said unions would be ""checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment"". The national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, appealed to the government to ensure smaller firms could benefit from the scheme, adding: ""Small businesses must not be left waiting in line behind big corporates when they could get people to work now.""

"The Chancellor has said his package of measures aimed at limiting the economic impact of coronavirus are ""absolutely vital"" for Scotland. Rishi Sunak said many rural areas of Scotland would particularly benefit from a cut to VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector. And he said Scotland would now receive a total of Â£4.6bn in additional Barnett funding from the UK government. The figure had been put at Â£3.8bn by the UK government before his statement. The Scottish government welcomed parts of Mr Sunak's announcement, but accused him of showing a lack of ambition by not introducing the Â£80bn stimulus package it had called for. Many of the measures unveiled by Mr Sunak will apply in Scotland, including the ""job retention bonus"" that will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for at least three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. What does mini-budget mean for Scotland? Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Sunak cuts VAT on hospitality to 'save jobs' VAT on food, accommodation and attractions will be cut across the UK from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. The cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs, accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites, attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos. Mr Sunak also unveiled a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out across the UK in August. And he announced aÂ£2bn ""kickstart"" schemeto help create more jobs for young people which will cover Scotland, England and Wales. The chancellor's speech, as expected, was all about jobs with billions of pounds to stem looming unemployment. For a Conservative government these are big spending interventions, perhaps more natural territory for Labour or the SNP. It's certainly no easy balancing act for a relatively new chancellor. He wants to give people hope but he certainly isn't sugar-coating it. Despite calls to extend the furlough scheme, it was a no. An admission some jobs will never come back, shifting the focus on getting employers to hire people who have been furloughed through bonuses. The chancellor was also keen to flash his unionist credentials early on. The UK government will be aware of a series of polls suggesting support for independence growing during the pandemic. So the chancellor stressed the ""special bond"" of the union and the support people in devolved nations received. However, his announcement of a temporary stamp duty holiday in England to stimulate the property market will not apply in Scotland unless the Scottish government matches the move through its equivalentLand and Buildings Transaction Tax.,external The Chancellor told the Commons that the UK government remained ""absolutely committed"" to its goal of ""levelling up in every part of the country"". He added: ""I am pleased to tell the House that the sum total of Barnett funding for Scotland as a result of all the interventions through this crisis now totals Â£4.6bn, which is going to support similar measures in Scotland as we are providing elsewhere. ""The measures I announced today - the jobs retention bonus for furloughed employees, the Kickstart scheme, the VAT cut, the eat out to help out discount - are all incredibly significant interventions and all of them benefit the entire United Kingdom."" Mr Sunak also stressed the importance of tourism to the Scottish economy, particularly in rural and coastal areas, and said that the VAT and eating out measures would be ""absolutely vital in driving the growth of Scotland going forward again"". He added: ""Again, they are a reminder to everyone - we are stronger together, one United Kingdom"". The UK government says measure it has previously introduced, such as the furlough scheme, have ""protected more than 620,000 jobs, thousands of businesses and paid Â£425m to self-employed people"" in Scotland. Kate Forbes says she needs additional borrowing powers to help Scotland's economic recovery from the pandemic The Scottish government had called on the Chancellor to show ""greater ambition in the level of investment in our economy"" by introducing an Â£80bn stimulus package. Its finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said that Mr Sunak's commitment to economic recovery ""appears to be less than half of that with no apparent increase in capital infrastructure"". She added: ""We called for an Â£80bn stimulus package to build a strong, green and inclusive economic recovery and while there are elements in this announcement to be welcomed, in particular the measures on VAT for tourism and hospitality, overall this package is a huge opportunity missed. ""It falls well short of delivering what is needed to boost the economy and protect jobs. ""There is no new capital spend, no extension to the furlough scheme for hard-hit sectors and no further support for households in financial difficulty. A half-price meal out does not help those struggling to put food on the table."" Ms Forbes made a request to be allowed to borrow Â£500m this year and to be given the flexibility to reallocate any unused capital funding on day-to-day spending in a letter to the Treasury two weeks ago. She has argued that the ""relatively limited"" changes would ""ease some of the immense pressures on our budget"" caused by the coronavirus crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time that he would consider the request - but there was no mention of it in the Chancellor's statement.

"Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 The Met has referred itself to the policing watchdog over the controversial stop-and-search of a British sprinter in west London. Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese 400m runner, were stopped in Maida Vale on Saturday. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Williams, 26, accused the Met of racially profiling her partner for driving a black Mercedes. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) will investigate. Footage of the stop and search has been shared widely on social media. In a statement the Met said the decision to refer to the IOPC had been taken ""due to the complaint being recorded and the significant public interest"". ""Two reviews of the circumstances by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards have not identified misconduct for any officer involved,"" the force added. This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted The Met had said officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. But Ms Williams believes she and her partner were targeted because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? ""They [the officers] said there's a lot of youth violence and stabbings in the area and that the car looked very suspicious,"" she said on Monday. ""They see a black male driving a nice car, an all-black car, and they assume that he was involved in some sort of gang, drug, violence problem."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the BBC he was ""pleased"" that the Met had referred the case as ""it's really important that Londoners have trust and confidence in the police and the way the police are policed"". ""There are concerns about the how the police behaved so it's right and proper that those concerns are looked into,"" he said. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said it had been supporting officers involved in the incident and called on the IOPC to ""conclude their work in a fair and timely fashion"". He added that ""a short clip of an incident widely shared on social media does not always tell the full operational policing story"". The police watchdog is alsoinvestigating a video of a white officer from Cambridgeshire Policequizzing a black driver which was shot in Ely in 2015 and was shared on Facebook in June as Black Lives Matter protests took place.

"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home. Calculate how much LBTT you will have to pay,external In Wales the current standard rates forLand Transaction Tax,external(LTT) are: Â£0-Â£225,000 = 0% Â£225, 001-Â£400,000 = 6% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 7.5% Â£750,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m + = 12% Purchasers usually have to pay the higher rate of LTT if they: buy a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and already own one or more other properties The higher rates of LTT are: Â£0-Â£180,000 = 4% Â£180,001-Â£250,000 = 7.5% Â£250,001-Â£400,000 = 9% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 11.5% Â£750,0001-Â£1,500,000 14% Â£1.5m + = 16% Calculate how much LTT you will have to pay,external You have 14 days to pay stamp duty from the date of completion in England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

"Strawberries and cream, maybe even a glass of rosÃ©: the ""summer update"" has a whiff of end-of term festivities. But the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday may impact millions of livelihoods - and his own reputation. The grants, subsidies and loans deployed to shield the British economy from the shock of lockdown didn't manage to preserve all jobs. However, they ensured that lay-offs in the first couple of months of lockdown were in the thousands, rather than millions. The real test for Rishi Sunak starts now. As one of his predecessors remarked, everyone loves the chancellor when he's splashing the cash, and those schemes have cost tens of billions - in total he's staring at a Â£300bn deficit this year. With the furlough scheme set to be wound down, it's clear crippling job losses in some sectors are under way. This emergency mini-Budget on Wednesday will attempt to help minimise the pain as the economy convalesces by ""flattening the curve"" - this time of job losses - and to prevent the kind of lingering mass joblessness last seen when the chancellor was a toddler, that risks blighting millions of lives. Here are five areas to bear in mind - we already know some of what he'll look at, but there's more to come. At present, some economists say unemployment could triple to over four million this year. Rishi Sunak is expected to detail the beefing up of job centres, with more work coaches and advisers - underscoring that the government too is getting ready for an onslaught of losses. The rise in joblessness won't be fleeting; the first advisers won't be in place until October. There's more money for careers advice too, and work placements. Learning new skills will be vital - particularly for the youngest workers and lowest paid who've been particularly badly hit. Rishi Sunak has talked of preserving jobs where possible, and that may mean taking different approaches with different industries. A skilled workforce isn't enough; you need the demand for their talents - in other words, flourishing businesses. And some of those are suffering simply because they've not been able to open yet. Lyceum Theatre in London, home to the Lion King, was wrapped in messages of support last week in a campaign calling on the government to prevent the arts industry from collapse The struggling arts and heritage sectorhas been promised a Â£1.6bn bespoke package of loans and grants. That's a shift away from the Treasury's previous reluctance to provide tailored help - and may raise hopes elsewhere. But will those industries that don't have the glamour of showbiz, with high-profile spokespeople, be as lucky? The package for the arts sector may signal that the chancellor remains reluctant to extend the furlough scheme, even for struggling sectors. Some sectors - travel, for example - may fail to ever fully recover in the absence of a vaccine. Rather than prop them up, some argue it would be better to divert resources to supporting growing industries. Rishi Sunak is expected to earmark some cash to support green jobs and to promote environmentally friendly home improvements. Incentives for other ""new"" industries may also feature. Even the future of businesses who have reopened may not be secure, unless customers feel safe coming back, not just physically, but financially. Rishi Sunak has stopped short of a haircut photo opportunity, but he's set the tone with visits to shops, markets and even the pub, despite being teetotal. Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Rishi Sunak urged by MPs to extend self-employed help What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? And now he may be after our bank accounts. A record amount of money was stashed away in May as the majority of the population saw their incomes untroubled, but their spending reduced. An emergency short-term VAT cut of say, 2% or 3%, targeted at perhaps the hospitality industry may tempt us to part with some cash. A waiter serves drinks to diners in the Soho area of London on Saturday as pubs and bars reopened A similar cut was tried during the financial crisis but its impact was limited. Other ideas that have been touted include state-issued vouchers to spend on holidays, or changes to National Insurance contributions. All would bear a cost of billions. The next annual Budget is due in the autumn, which gives the chancellor time to mull over how the economy is progressing and introduce more measures, alongside the usual forecasts. We may, however, not have to wait that long for rumoured temporary changes to stamp duty. Some now expect that measure, which would boost the fortunes of homebuyers and housebuilders, to come up this Wednesday. At that Budget, we may hear more about how he will pay for all this. At present, the government is able to borrow cheaply via bonds on the financial markets, but there are limits. Mr Sunak may have to find other ways of footing the bill, such as pausing the ""triple lock"" formula used to calculate pension rises, for example. That won't be popular. Five months into the job, Mr Sunak is enjoying popularity ratings far in excess of that of his Cabinet colleagues, thanks to his handling of the economic crisis so far. Hanging on to that pole position over the challenging months - or even years - ahead will be no picnic. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"Plans include a new Â£2bn scheme to create thousands of job placements for young people The chancellor announces a temporary change to stamp duty - immediately increasing the threshold to Â£500,000 Temporary cut to VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% is announced Chancellor announces new job retention bonus for employers who bring back furloughed staff But Labour says the chancellor has ""put off big decisions"" and should have announced a ""back to work Budget"" A Â£2bn ""green homes grant"" to help make homes more energy efficient is also unveiled âEat out to help outâ vouchers that will give diners 50% off their meals out, with conditions, for August Paul Seddon and Kate Whannel Chancellor at the despatch box earlier this afternoon That's the end of our live coverage of the chancellor's economic update today. Below is a selection of
the key announcements -you
can read a full summary here- andhere's our news story.  The Chancellor serving customers in a central London restaurant. After his speech in the Commons, this afternoon Rishi Sunak visited a branch of the restaurant chain Wagamama in Central London. The chancellor chatted to customers, served them lunch and asked how they felt about being out and about after the lockdown. Speaking to the media afterwards the chancellor said, the government had been right to act ""in the way we have during this crisis"". ""Weâve stepped in, weâve limited long term damage. But in the medium term we will and must return to a position of financial sustainability."" Former chair of Pizza Express Luke Johnson has been speaking to Radio 4's PM programme. He says: âThese are extraordinary
announcements for a government to be making â¦ every bit is helpful."" On whether theAugust voucherswill work he says: âI think a lot of people are still frightened and so every
inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their
habits of eating and spending and working is good news. âI think the government must also help with its messaging
and communications â¦and start encouraging people, as they have in other
countries, to get back to a degree of usual behaviour and that will allow
businesses to survive and jobs to be maintained.â Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts says some of the chancellor's measures are welcome including support for young people getting into work. However she urges the government to look at extending furlough schemes for those sectors hard hit by the crisis such as tourism. She also says she would like to see furlough extended in those areas where a local lockdown is implemented. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says ""I fear - just as the government was slow to act on the health consequences they are being far too slow to respond to the economic consequences of Covid-19. ""Many of those who have been furloughed will soon be unemployed... I fear we are about to enter levels of mass unemployment."" He says Â£1,000 isn't enough for employers in various sectors that had their businesses closed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the government will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease. The opposition parties already suggest that the scale of what the government is proposing falls short of what will be required. Rishi Sunak admitted in his statement ""our plan will not be the last - it is the next"", knowing full well that the profound economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is far from passed. Read Laura's blog in full here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak has confirmed the
governmentâs furlough scheme will close in October. He
says this will be a ''difficult moment'' and that some jobs will not be
protected. The
scheme has been paying up to 80% of the wages of nine million people who canât work because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Furlough
was designed to help support employees and businesses in hard-hit sectors, and
prevent mass redundancies. Furloughed
employees can now go back to work part-time, and from August, employers will have to pay National Insurance
and pension contributions for their staff. In
September, they will have to pay 10% of their furloughed employees' salaries -
rising to 20% in October. There
are concerns there may be significant job losses when the scheme finishes, and
the chancellor has offered firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every furloughed employee
they keep on until the end of January, and pay at least Â£520 a month. Read
more about the rights of furloughed employeeshere. Clive Docwra, Managing Director
of construction consultancy McBains, said it is important to get the economy moving but that the ""long-term outlook is not great"". ""Many developers are hesitant about committing to new projects against a backdrop of coronavirus, and it's likely the government will need to provide ongoing support for some time to come â or, at the very least, until an effective treatment or vaccine is found,"" he says. However he welcomed measures such as theKickstart schemeand traineeship money which he said would ""give developers confidence
that returning to full operational capacity may well be a risk worth taking.â Reality Check During
his speech, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: âAnalysis
Iâm publishing today shows our interventions significantly protected peopleâs
incomes, with the least well off in society supported the most.â The
analysis does suggest that the lowest-paid benefited most - you can find the analysis documenthere.,external It
doesnât quite show the least well off âin societyâ being supported the most â
itâs only an analysis of households with a working member before coronavirus, so those relying on benefits or pensioner households are
not included. Also,
the analysis assumes that nobody will be paid more than the Â£2,500 maximum
offered by the furlough scheme (it ignores top-ups by employers) which means
high-earning furloughed households are bound to lose out more. For
example, somebody being furloughed who normally earned Â£5,000 a month would be
assumed to lose Â£2,500 a month in earnings, while somebody normally earning
Â£2,500 a month would only lose Â£500 a month â clearly in that model the lower
paid would be doing better. BBC Sounds What does todayâs summer statement mean for your job, your wages or your business? Let the#yourworkyourmoney,externalpodcast team answer your query, just post your question on social media including the hashtag. And listen via@bbcsounds,externalhttp://bbc.in/3iHz1XK,external Thomas Woollard hopes businesses will invest in young people on the new job placements Thomas Woollard is 21 years old and has begun the process of applying for Universal Credit. He plans to look into the Chancellor's placement scheme for young people in more detail. âIâd like to see if it would benefit me,"" he says. ""If I can get on to
the scheme and get some income from somewhere Iâll definitely consider it."" Thomas also wonders whether businesses will invest in the people on the scheme or just take the free labour the government is offering. He adds: âWill businesses see this as an investment in themselves, in the country and invest in young people or will they just take the paid work
they are given?"" James Storey is landlord of a small stand-alone pub in Gateshead. He says that the chancellor's plans won't help people like him. ""I run a small pub which is not linked to the major breweries. I won't benefit from the hospitality plans as we don't serve food. ""Also, due to social distancing rules, I only have 17 seats available on my premises. ""I originally had four staff prior to lockdown. Two are not coming back as they have new jobs in the NHS call centre. ""Many customers will continue to use cheap supermarket booze and drink in open spaces. ""There is nothing in this announcement for small local pubs"". Gina Broadhurst, co-founder of the ForgottenLtd Campaign for small limited company directors, said: ""It makes no sense for the government to reward companies for bringing employees back from furlough or creating new apprenticeships if those same companies are going out of business. She says ""hundreds of thousands of small business owners employing millions of people have received zero support and are on the verge of collapse."" ""For them, the chancellor's silence was deafening. While the cut in VAT for the hospitality industry is to be welcomed, as are the job creation and apprenticeship schemes, millions of small businesses are still missing out on support. Caroline Nokes, Chair of Women and Equalities Committee has welcomed the ""speedily delivered and far reaching"" measures in the chancellor's economic statement. But she said, ""the lack of focus on using his three-point plan to boost gender equality is a missed opportunity. ""There was no mention of helping businesses in sectors where women are disproportionately represented and which remain shut down, for example the beauty industry. ""It was disappointing to hear no mention of government support for the childcare sector, which predominantly employs women. We know that affordable, reliable childcare is key in enabling women to return to work and stay in work."" Our teams have been working on some guides to help make sense of what today's announcements means. Here's a round-up of our explainers: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Today's announcement is not just about trying to protect jobs but also encouraging employers who might still be having a very difficult time, to keep employees in work. The government also know that another huge package is not necessarily going to be enough to stop some people losing their jobs What they are trying to avoid is mass unemployment. This isn't the end of it - there's a question of how this is going to be paid for. All that is to come - and that could be a much more difficult day for the chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Rishi Sunak has just finished taking questions from MPs in the Commons. Chancellor cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government is offering a
carrot to businesses if they hang on to their workers. Â£1,000 for every worker who returns from
furlough who is still employed at the end of January. The government says it
could cost up to Â£9bn â a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed
workers multiplied by Â£1000. Of course it wonât be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to
start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and
then over 20% in October â followed by three months of full wages to land a
prize of Â£1,000 during the worst recession in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent
on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in the worst-affected industries by cutting VAT andoffering half-price early bird food, but
it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that
long. We also learned two other
important things today. First, that any idea of extending the furlough scheme â
as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and
business are realising just how much they need each other. These programmes are big and
challenging to deliver. Rishi Sunak said early on that today is not the last
intervention but the next intervention. The biggest question of all â the question that may determine the future of hundreds
of thousands of workers - is whether heâs made his carrot big enough. Labour's shadow justice's secretary David Lammy has tweeted his concern that law firms are not being supported. ""A Law Society survey of small firms in April found that 71% of small firms fear cashflow issues could force their closure within 6 months. ""But not a single word in the government's Plan for Jobs to protect them,"" he says. BlackRock, one of the world's largest pension and money managers, offers a gentle warning in what it describes as ""this blurring of monetary and fiscal policy"" as very low interest rates and big government spending take off, not just in the UK, but around the world. ""While there is little likelihood of material near-term
inflation, once we look out further into this decade, this blurring of monetary
and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks globally,"" said Vivek Paul, Chief Investment Strategist for
     the UK, BlackRock Investment Institute, the research wing of the firm. He says investors might consider looking at inflation-linked government bonds rather than the vanilla variety. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fast fashion brand Boohoo has ordered an independent review of its UK supply chain following reports of poor working conditions at a factory in Leicester. It comes after retailers Next and Asos dropped Boohoo goods from their stores amid claims workers were underpaid and not socially distancing. The firm is also facing calls for a boycott on social media. Boohoo, which said it was ""appalled"" by the allegations, has asked a senior barrister to lead the review. It comes after a Sunday Times report claimed workers at a Leicester factory that supplied clothes to Boohoo were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. The factory was also said to be operating during a localised lockdown designed to stop a spike in Covid-19 cases in Leicester. Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, has separately claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were ""forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". Boohoo said it took ""extremely seriously all allegations of malpractice, poor working conditions, and underpayment of workers"". It said that Alison Levitt, a senior barrister who specialises in business crime, would lead an investigation looking into whether the company's suppliers pay the minimum wage, and comply with coronavirus safety regulations, working hours rules and immigration law. Big problem at Leicester factories, say workers Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando Boohoo swoops again to snap up Oasis and Warehouse brands It will also spend an initial Â£10m ""to eradicate supply chain malpractice"", with the help of audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas. The brand is popular with young women in particular, who it targets with marketing campaigns using Instagram ""influencers"" including contestants from the reality TV show Love Island . That strategy could be in question, as the company was criticised on platforms including Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag boycottboohoo. Allow Twitter content?

However, shares in the firm have dropped by almost half this week, diving 23% on Wednesday alone. The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in Manchester in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane. Before the Sunday Times' investigation the business was valued at about Â£5bn.

the key announcements -you
can read a full summary here- andhere's our news story.  The Chancellor serving customers in a central London restaurant. After his speech in the Commons, this afternoon Rishi Sunak visited a branch of the restaurant chain Wagamama in Central London. The chancellor chatted to customers, served them lunch and asked how they felt about being out and about after the lockdown. Speaking to the media afterwards the chancellor said, the government had been right to act ""in the way we have during this crisis"". ""Weâve stepped in, weâve limited long term damage. But in the medium term we will and must return to a position of financial sustainability."" Former chair of Pizza Express Luke Johnson has been speaking to Radio 4's PM programme. He says: âThese are extraordinary
announcements for a government to be making â¦ every bit is helpful."" On whether theAugust voucherswill work he says: âI think a lot of people are still frightened and so every
inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their
habits of eating and spending and working is good news. âI think the government must also help with its messaging
and communications â¦and start encouraging people, as they have in other
countries, to get back to a degree of usual behaviour and that will allow
businesses to survive and jobs to be maintained.â Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts says some of the chancellor's measures are welcome including support for young people getting into work. However she urges the government to look at extending furlough schemes for those sectors hard hit by the crisis such as tourism. She also says she would like to see furlough extended in those areas where a local lockdown is implemented. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says ""I fear - just as the government was slow to act on the health consequences they are being far too slow to respond to the economic consequences of Covid-19. ""Many of those who have been furloughed will soon be unemployed... I fear we are about to enter levels of mass unemployment."" He says Â£1,000 isn't enough for employers in various sectors that had their businesses closed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the government will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease. The opposition parties already suggest that the scale of what the government is proposing falls short of what will be required. Rishi Sunak admitted in his statement ""our plan will not be the last - it is the next"", knowing full well that the profound economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is far from passed. Read Laura's blog in full here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak has confirmed the
governmentâs furlough scheme will close in October. He
says this will be a ''difficult moment'' and that some jobs will not be
protected. The
scheme has been paying up to 80% of the wages of nine million people who canât work because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Furlough
was designed to help support employees and businesses in hard-hit sectors, and
prevent mass redundancies. Furloughed
employees can now go back to work part-time, and from August, employers will have to pay National Insurance
and pension contributions for their staff. In
September, they will have to pay 10% of their furloughed employees' salaries -
rising to 20% in October. There
are concerns there may be significant job losses when the scheme finishes, and
the chancellor has offered firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every furloughed employee
they keep on until the end of January, and pay at least Â£520 a month. Read
more about the rights of furloughed employeeshere. Clive Docwra, Managing Director
of construction consultancy McBains, said it is important to get the economy moving but that the ""long-term outlook is not great"". ""Many developers are hesitant about committing to new projects against a backdrop of coronavirus, and it's likely the government will need to provide ongoing support for some time to come â or, at the very least, until an effective treatment or vaccine is found,"" he says. However he welcomed measures such as theKickstart schemeand traineeship money which he said would ""give developers confidence
that returning to full operational capacity may well be a risk worth taking.â Reality Check During
his speech, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: âAnalysis
Iâm publishing today shows our interventions significantly protected peopleâs
incomes, with the least well off in society supported the most.â The
analysis does suggest that the lowest-paid benefited most - you can find the analysis documenthere.,external It
doesnât quite show the least well off âin societyâ being supported the most â
itâs only an analysis of households with a working member before coronavirus, so those relying on benefits or pensioner households are
not included. Also,
the analysis assumes that nobody will be paid more than the Â£2,500 maximum
offered by the furlough scheme (it ignores top-ups by employers) which means
high-earning furloughed households are bound to lose out more. For
example, somebody being furloughed who normally earned Â£5,000 a month would be
assumed to lose Â£2,500 a month in earnings, while somebody normally earning
Â£2,500 a month would only lose Â£500 a month â clearly in that model the lower
paid would be doing better. BBC Sounds What does todayâs summer statement mean for your job, your wages or your business? Let the#yourworkyourmoney,externalpodcast team answer your query, just post your question on social media including the hashtag. And listen via@bbcsounds,externalhttp://bbc.in/3iHz1XK,external Thomas Woollard hopes businesses will invest in young people on the new job placements Thomas Woollard is 21 years old and has begun the process of applying for Universal Credit. He plans to look into the Chancellor's placement scheme for young people in more detail. âIâd like to see if it would benefit me,"" he says. ""If I can get on to
the scheme and get some income from somewhere Iâll definitely consider it."" Thomas also wonders whether businesses will invest in the people on the scheme or just take the free labour the government is offering. He adds: âWill businesses see this as an investment in themselves, in the country and invest in young people or will they just take the paid work
they are given?"" James Storey is landlord of a small stand-alone pub in Gateshead. He says that the chancellor's plans won't help people like him. ""I run a small pub which is not linked to the major breweries. I won't benefit from the hospitality plans as we don't serve food. ""Also, due to social distancing rules, I only have 17 seats available on my premises. ""I originally had four staff prior to lockdown. Two are not coming back as they have new jobs in the NHS call centre. ""Many customers will continue to use cheap supermarket booze and drink in open spaces. ""There is nothing in this announcement for small local pubs"". Gina Broadhurst, co-founder of the ForgottenLtd Campaign for small limited company directors, said: ""It makes no sense for the government to reward companies for bringing employees back from furlough or creating new apprenticeships if those same companies are going out of business. She says ""hundreds of thousands of small business owners employing millions of people have received zero support and are on the verge of collapse."" ""For them, the chancellor's silence was deafening. While the cut in VAT for the hospitality industry is to be welcomed, as are the job creation and apprenticeship schemes, millions of small businesses are still missing out on support. Caroline Nokes, Chair of Women and Equalities Committee has welcomed the ""speedily delivered and far reaching"" measures in the chancellor's economic statement. But she said, ""the lack of focus on using his three-point plan to boost gender equality is a missed opportunity. ""There was no mention of helping businesses in sectors where women are disproportionately represented and which remain shut down, for example the beauty industry. ""It was disappointing to hear no mention of government support for the childcare sector, which predominantly employs women. We know that affordable, reliable childcare is key in enabling women to return to work and stay in work."" Our teams have been working on some guides to help make sense of what today's announcements means. Here's a round-up of our explainers: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Today's announcement is not just about trying to protect jobs but also encouraging employers who might still be having a very difficult time, to keep employees in work. The government also know that another huge package is not necessarily going to be enough to stop some people losing their jobs What they are trying to avoid is mass unemployment. This isn't the end of it - there's a question of how this is going to be paid for. All that is to come - and that could be a much more difficult day for the chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Rishi Sunak has just finished taking questions from MPs in the Commons. Chancellor cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government is offering a
carrot to businesses if they hang on to their workers. Â£1,000 for every worker who returns from
furlough who is still employed at the end of January. The government says it
could cost up to Â£9bn â a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed
workers multiplied by Â£1000. Of course it wonât be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to
start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and
then over 20% in October â followed by three months of full wages to land a
prize of Â£1,000 during the worst recession in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent
on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in the worst-affected industries by cutting VAT andoffering half-price early bird food, but
it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that
long. We also learned two other
important things today. First, that any idea of extending the furlough scheme â
as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and
business are realising just how much they need each other. These programmes are big and
challenging to deliver. Rishi Sunak said early on that today is not the last
intervention but the next intervention. The biggest question of all â the question that may determine the future of hundreds
of thousands of workers - is whether heâs made his carrot big enough. Labour's shadow justice's secretary David Lammy has tweeted his concern that law firms are not being supported. ""A Law Society survey of small firms in April found that 71% of small firms fear cashflow issues could force their closure within 6 months. ""But not a single word in the government's Plan for Jobs to protect them,"" he says. BlackRock, one of the world's largest pension and money managers, offers a gentle warning in what it describes as ""this blurring of monetary and fiscal policy"" as very low interest rates and big government spending take off, not just in the UK, but around the world. ""While there is little likelihood of material near-term
inflation, once we look out further into this decade, this blurring of monetary
and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks globally,"" said Vivek Paul, Chief Investment Strategist for
     the UK, BlackRock Investment Institute, the research wing of the firm. He says investors might consider looking at inflation-linked government bonds rather than the vanilla variety. Â© 2025 BBC.

He's downplayed a threat from President Trump over schools reopening, saying the White House would be ""very respectful"" of states and communities who decide they can't fully open their schools. ""We're here to help,"" Mr Pence - a former governor of Indiana - told reporters. ""We don't want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance. We're here to assist with the shared objective, which I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back. We want to get them back in the classroom."" His tone was markedly different to that of President Trump, who earlier today threatened to cut off funding to schools that don't open in the autumn.

Ishaq KhalidBBC News, Abuja Passengers are required to wear face masks at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja Domestic passenger flights have resumed in Nigeria more
than three months after they were suspended as part of measures to contain the
coronavirus pandemic. Airports in the capital Abuja and the commercial hub
Lagos have begun operating again, while other airports across the
country will follow in the coming days. A number of measures have been put in place to check the
spread of the coronavirus - including disinfecting passengersâ luggage and footwear, mandatory wearing of face mask at airports, washing of hands before entry
into the terminal building and social distancing. Authorities also say only
passengers are allowed into the terminal building and they must arrive at least
three hours before their flight. The reopening of the airports for domestic flights is
part of the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions to help bring the
economy back to life. However, international flights remain suspended until
further notice. The number of coronavirus cases in Nigeria continues to rise sharply
daily. The country has recorded 29,879 cases of the virus, 12,108 recoveries
and 669 deaths. We reported earlier that the US has passed 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Vice President Mike Pence has just confirmed this at a press conference, and added that more than 130,000 people had died. Removing his mask to address reporters, Pence went on to defend President Trump's handling of the pandemic. He said the latest wave of cases seemed to be flattening out. ""While we mourn with those who mourn, because of what the American people have done, because of the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers around the country, we are encouraged that the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady,"" he said.

More than 131,000 people in the US have now died with Covid-19. The UK death toll for those who have tested positive for coronavirus has risen by 126 to 44,517, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The below charts show the figures - and trends in the numbers - in more detail. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg Gauteng is expected to be the next coronavirus epicentre South Africa now has the 14th highest number of Covid-19 infections globally and officials are concerned it is spreading rapidly. More than 10,000 new infections and 192 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours. The Western Cape has the most cases currently, with just over 72,000 infections. But Guateng, the countryâs economic hub, is set to become the new epicentre of the disease in the next few days. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, chairperson of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory committee, said the virus was spreading fastest in Gauteng for two reasons: The province has the highest traffic of foreign and domestic employees, and Gauteng also has the highest population density. Although the re-opening of more industries is deemed necessary to save the economy, the government has asked South Africans to continue taking precautions to help slow down the spread of the virus. At least 3,470 people in South Africa have died from the disease. The National Gallery has reopened its doors to the public. The London gallery has become the first of the major UK art institutions to reopen as coronavirus restrictions are eased.

The gallery's Titian exhibition has reopened - after being forced to close in March, three days into its run.

Romania's capital, Bucharest, is one of the country's worst affected cities Romania has reported its highest daily number of infections since the country's first case of coronavirus was confirmed. The record tally of 555 new cases over a 24-hour period brings Romania's total to 30,175 infections, the government said today. The last time the number of confirmed daily infections breached 500 was on 11 April, when 523 cases were reported. Since Romania's first infections were announced on 26 February, 1,817 people have died in the country.

More than 131,000 people in the US have now died with Covid-19. The UK death toll for those who have tested positive for coronavirus has risen by 126 to 44,517, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The below charts show the figures - and trends in the numbers - in more detail. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg Gauteng is expected to be the next coronavirus epicentre South Africa now has the 14th highest number of Covid-19 infections globally and officials are concerned it is spreading rapidly. More than 10,000 new infections and 192 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours. The Western Cape has the most cases currently, with just over 72,000 infections. But Guateng, the countryâs economic hub, is set to become the new epicentre of the disease in the next few days. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, chairperson of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory committee, said the virus was spreading fastest in Gauteng for two reasons: The province has the highest traffic of foreign and domestic employees, and Gauteng also has the highest population density. Although the re-opening of more industries is deemed necessary to save the economy, the government has asked South Africans to continue taking precautions to help slow down the spread of the virus. At least 3,470 people in South Africa have died from the disease. The National Gallery has reopened its doors to the public. The London gallery has become the first of the major UK art institutions to reopen as coronavirus restrictions are eased.

The gallery's Titian exhibition has reopened - after being forced to close in March, three days into its run. ""People are desperate for some good news and some places to go and, frankly, I think that the arts are very important in people's wellbeing,"" said the gallery's director, Gabriele Finaldi. ""We're very keen to be part of that recovery process."" Diners in Melbourne after the first lockdown was eased last month Melbourne is now officially in lockdown, again, for six weeks, after a surge in cases of coronavirus. People in the city, where it's now the early hours of 9 July, are barred from leaving their homes other than in very specific circumstances, such as work, exercise and shopping for food. Schools will largely return to distance learning and restaurants will only be permitted to serve takeaway food, although hairdressers will remain open. Before heading indoors for a month and a half, many Melburnians went out for dinner and drinks, while others had their friends over for a final hurrah. Allow Twitter content?

As we reported earlier, VP Mike Pence has been holding a press briefing, where he confirmed the US has passed 3 million cases of the virus. He's downplayed a threat from President Trump over schools reopening, saying the White House would be ""very respectful"" of states and communities who decide they can't fully open their schools. ""We're here to help,"" Mr Pence - a former governor of Indiana - told reporters. ""We don't want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance. We're here to assist with the shared objective, which I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back. We want to get them back in the classroom."" His tone was markedly different to that of President Trump, who earlier today threatened to cut off funding to schools that don't open in the autumn.

Schools in the US normally begin the year in either August or early September. The CDC's guidelines suggest pupils and staff all wear face coverings and stay at home if necessary. They also suggest schools should implement staggered timetables and socially distanced seating arrangements, and close communal spaces. However Mr Pence said the agency would be issuing new guidelines soon. The US has the highest number of infections, and the highest death toll, in the world. The Visual and Data Journalism Team The World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged there is ""emerging evidence"" that Covid-19 could be spread through particles in the air. It comes aftermore than 200 scientists wrote an open letter to the agencyurging officials to recognise the possibility of airborne transmission of the virus. Current guidelines from the WHO focus on the virus being spread primarily through droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.

"FBI Director Christopher Wray, pictured in February, described a wide-ranging campaign by the Chinese government to disrupt US life The director of the FBI has said that acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the ""greatest long-term threat"" to the future of the US. Speaking to the Hudson Institute in Washington, Christopher Wray described a multi-pronged disruption campaign. He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. ""The stakes could not be higher,"" Mr Wray said. ""China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary,"" he added. The spying game: China's global network Could TikTok be banned in the US? The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order In a nearly hour-long speech on Tuesday, the FBI director outlined a stark picture of Chinese interference, a far-reaching campaign of economic espionage, data and monetary theft and illegal political activities, using bribery and blackmail to influence US policy. ""We've now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,"" Mr Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China."" The FBI director mentioned a programme called ""Fox Hunt"", which he said President Xi Jinping had ""spearheaded"" and he said was geared at Chinese nationals living abroad seen as threats to the Chinese government. ""We're talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations,"" he said. ""The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China's tactics to accomplish that are shocking."" 'I'm Asian, so I can never be American' Coronavirus: The US-China battle behind the scenes He continued: ""When it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide."" The programme was originally begun in 2015 to target people accused of corruption and has reportedly led to the capture of thousands of fugitives. However,reports of extraordinary rendition of political opponents by Beijing have multiplied in recent years, starting with Gui Minhai, one of a group of Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in Chinese custody. Unlike the others, Mr Gui disappeared abroad - in Thailand - rather than from Hong Kong itself. China is fast becoming a new kind of threat to the West, not so much because of its growing military capabilities - though that is a factor - but because in economic and technical terms it is already a peer competitor of the United States, and a peer competitor in a very different kind of world. Nineteenth Century great powers competed more or less on equal terms but operated in a far less integrated international system. In the second half of the 20th Century, the Soviet Union was a peer military competitor of the United States, but with a relatively weak economy largely isolated from the wider international system. China, however, has huge and growing economic muscle. It shares much of the same economic space with the West and its dominance of crucial supply chains - think medical PPE for example - only enhances its power. The level of integration of today's globalised world and the importance of data and information only act as force multipliers for Beijing's overt and covert global reach. In the unusual address, Mr Wray asked Chinese-born people living in the US to contact the FBI if Chinese officials target them seeking their return. The Chinese government has defended this programme in the past, saying it is part of a legitimate anti-corruption effort. The threat posed by China will be further addressed by the US attorney general and secretary of state in coming weeks, Mr Wray said. This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US The address comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China. US President Donald Trump has been highly critical of China amid the coronavirus outbreak, repeatedly blaming the country for the global pandemic. In another move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the administration was looking at banning Chinese apps - including the hugely popular TikTok. The apps ""serve as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state"", he said.

"Olalekan Jacob Ponle, known as ""mrwoodbery"" to his Instagram followers, flaunted his wealth The day after his 29th birthday in May, Olalekan Jacob Ponle posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to a bright yellow Lamborghini in Dubai. ""Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you've acquired,"" he admonished, wearing designer jewellery and Gucci clothes from head to toe. A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name ""mrwoodbery"" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, ""hushpuppi"" or just ""hush"" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (Â£32m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims.

Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,"" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC. It is a spectacular crash for the two Nigerian men who extensively documented their high-flying lifestyle on social media, raising questions about the sources of their wealth. They unwittingly provided crucial information about their identities and activities for American detectives with their Instagram and Snapchat posts. They are accused of impersonating legitimate employees of various US companies in ""business email compromise"" (BEC) schemes and tricking the recipients into wiring millions of dollars into their own accounts. On Instagram, hushpuppi said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called ""Flexing"" - social media lingo for showing off. But the ""houses"" were actually a codeword for bank accounts ""used to receive proceeds of a fraudulent scheme"", investigators allege. ""Our value system in Nigeria needs to be checked, especially the emphasis we place on wealth, no matter how you got it,"" the economist Ebuka Emebinah told the BBC from New York. ""It's a culture where people believe that results speak for you. We don't place as much emphasis on the process and this has built up over time."" In April, hushpuppi renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number. ""Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,"" he captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just a fortnight before he was arrested. ""Abbas finances this opulent lifestyle through crime, and he is one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitates computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes (including BEC schemes), and money laundering, targeting victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said in an affidavit.

In one case, a foreign financial institution allegedly lost $14.7m in a cyber-heist where the money ended up in hushpuppi's bank accounts in multiple countries. The affidavit also alleged that he was involved in a scheme to steal $124m from an unnamed English Premier League team. The FBI obtained records from his Google, Apple iCloud, Instagram and Snapchat accounts which allegedly contained banking information, passports, communication with conspirators and records of wire transfers. About 90% of business email compromise scams originate in West Africa, research from American email security firm Agari shows. The complaint against Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle describe tactics that resemble what the company calls Vendor Email Compromise tactics, where scammers compromise an email account and study communication between a customer and a vendor. ""The scammer would gather contextual details, as they watched the legitimate email flow,"" explains Crane Hassold, Agari's senior director of threat research. ""The bad actor would redirect emails to the bad actor's email account, craft emails to the customer that looked like they are coming from the vendor, indicate that the 'vendor' had a new bank account, provide 'updated' bank account information and the money would be gone, at that point."" Mr Ponle, known online as ""mrwoodberry"", used Mark Kain in emails, according to the FBI. He is accused of defrauding a Chicago-based company into sending wire transfers of $15.2m. Companies in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and California are also said to have fallen victim. The cash trail allegedly disappeared after his accomplices, called money mules, converted the money into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Email scams have become so prevalent globally, and so deeply linked to Nigeria, that the fraudsters have a name in the country: ""Yahoo boys"". They try to convince a recipient to wire money to the other side of the world or they go ""phishing"", stealing a user's identity and personal information for fraud. The FBI warns against the Nigerian letter or ""419"" fraud - emails promising large sums of money, called advance fee scams. The ""Nigerian prince"" trope has become shorthand for deception. An individual may contact you via e-mail, explaining he needs help to transfer money Will tell you that political turmoil or a natural disaster makes it difficult for him to make the transfer Will ask you to give him your financial details so that he can transfer the money into your account This allows him to access and steal from your account Be careful what you post on social media and dating sites as scammers use the details to better understand you and target you A Washington, DC-based attorney, Moe Odele, finds it frustrating as a Nigerian because it ignores the ""systemic failures that have led to brilliant Nigerian youths engaging in these scams"", in the country and abroad. ""They see it as an easy way out in a country that offers them limited options and, in many cases, no options at all,"" she says. ""But there are also many brilliant Nigerians are represented in world stages from education to pop culture."" Last month, the US Treasury Department blacklisted six Nigerians among 79 individuals and organisations in its Most Wanted cybercriminals list. It accused them of stealing more than $6m from American citizens through deceptive global threats like BEC and romance fraud.

""A lot of Nigerians are doing fantastic things all over the world, but they don't get as much media mileage as the guys doing bad things. It affects all the guys doing legitimate stuff especially in the tech space,"" he said.

An equine charity saysit has lost about Â£300,000 in revenueas a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Bransby Horses, based near Lincoln, closed to the public in March, but reopened earlier after lockdown restrictions were eased. Chief executive Jo Snell said it had been a tough time for everyone involved with the charity. ""We rely heavily on public support, and don't receive any government funding, so it has hit us hard,"" she said. The charity said it had already suffered losses of about Â£200,000 after its Bransby site, which is home to about 450 animals, was hit by flooding in November. Local Democracy Reporting Service Soho residents have mixed feelings about the events of Saturday night after images of packed streets and drunken antics filled the news. Parts of the West End were pedestrianised over the weekend to allow restaurants and bars to put tables and chairs in the streets from 17:00 to 23:00, with inspiration taken from continental outdoor-dining culture. Tim Lord, chair of the Soho Society residents group, said we âcanât have the chaos again that we saw on Saturday. âThere was not enough marshalling... There needs to be a way of making it street dining rather than a street party. If they canât, the whole thing might have to be pulled.â Meanwhile, 84-year-old Debbie Smith, of Old Compton Street, said jokingly: âIâve lived here 50 years, it was much worse in the 1960s. Yes it was very busy, and noisy to live next to. But heavens, what do you expect?â Nicholas, from Frith Street, said he felt ""sorry for the restaurants because I think it would make more sense to pedestrianise the streets through the whole dayâ. The council was approached for comment on whether it will deploy more marshalls next weekend to disperse crowds, but it did not respond to that point. A spokesperson said: ""We are working with businesses in the area to ensure that they are operating responsibly and implementing the social distancing guidance that the council has provided."" Rob EnglandBBC News The number of deaths in hospitals where patients had coronavirus is currently 28,971 in England Figures were released by NHS England earlier today. Patients were aged between 22 and 100 and six people aged between 60 and 94 had no known underlying health conditions. A man who has spent more than a decade nurturing trees with truffle spores in the roots has finally had a bumper crop of the highly valuable food. But Mike Collison from Stapleton, Shropshire, can't sell his truffles because restaurants are only just getting back on their feet during the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, a yield which would usually sell for Â£30,000 isn't making a penny. Mr Collison has been giving away truffles for free, to people in the village, so they don't go to waste. This video can not be played Our teams have been working on some guides to help make sense of today's announcements. Here's a round-up of our analysis: Sailors from Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales are helping to run Covid-19 testing stations. The teams from the Portsmouth-based warship are currently manning seven mobile testing unit sites across Hampshire including Eastleigh, Fawley and Brockenhurst with further assistance planned for Farnborough and Alton. The crew members are carrying out the work while the Prince of Wales is undergoing maintenance ahead of sea trials including embarking F-35 Lightning jets for the first time. Nearly 3,000 military personnel are involved in assisting with the national response to the pandemic, with Royal Marines also running testing centres in the South West. Rob EnglandBBC News Waste crews hailed as ""lockdown heroes"" a short while ago are being subjected to ""increasing levels of abuse"" a council has said. On social media,external, Exeter City Council said a number of its teams had been ""physically threatened"" over the past few weeks while performing ""day-to-day duties"". ""Just a short while ago, our crews were held up as lockdown heroes for working so hard during very difficult circumstances to ensure the cityâs bins were emptied and peopleâs lives could carry on with a semblance of normality,"" the council said. ""They should not be subjected to insults and aggression for carrying on with their already tough job now that restrictions have eased and the roads are busier,"" it added. ""We will not tolerate any abuse or threatening behaviour towards our staff."" The council said social distancing measures and road layout changes had ""made some routes busier"" around the city, but appealed for patience from those driving behind its vehicles. Free hospital parking for NHS staff will end in all but ""certain circumstances"" once the coronavirus pandemic begins to ease, the government has said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on March 25 the government would cover the costs of car parking for NHS staff who he said were ""going above and beyond every day"" at hospitals in England. But the Department of Health has said the free parking will continue only for ""key patient groups and NHS staff in certain circumstances"" as the pandemic eases, although no further timeline has been given. The British Medical Association (BMA) has said to reintroduce charges while the virus was still being fought would be ""a rebuff to the immense efforts of staff across the country and the sacrifices they have made to keep others safe"". A spokeswoman for the department said further updates on free parking would be provided ""in due course"". Value added tax (VAT) is to be cut on hospitality and tourism for the next six months, according to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The cut, from 20% to 5% applies to food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. It's a tax many of us don't notice directly - as it's usually already added to everyday items. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Nurseries have not been able to offer as many spaces during the coronavirus pandemic, although fewer children have needed places. Social distancing means fewer infants can be accommodated on site, but with parents shielding or losing jobs, there is less demand for places. The BBC spoke to people who run nurseries and the parents who use them, many of whom now face huge difficulties due to the crisis. This video can not be played BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson says: ""The one thing the chancellor skipped over - right at the beginning - he said he  was allocating Â£50bn to public services. ""Last time we looked that number was about Â£18bn - suddenly an extra Â£30bn has appeared in his numbers. If you look at the Treasury document - an astonishing Â£15m of that is to buy PPE for staff. There is another Â£10bn allocated to testing and tracing. ""It is quite surprising that very big amount of money was skated over so quickly."" Rob EnglandBBC News England's deputy chief medical officer has said she is ""very, very concerned"" about a second wave of Covid-19. Dr Jenny Harries said there was ""still quite a long haul"" to go with coronavirus, adding people must not become complacent and must keep up hand-washing, social distancing and limiting social interactions. ""The virus is still out there, it's looking for more people to infect and we need to stop it getting a grip,"" she said. Asked about the possibility of a second wave, she said: ""I think myself and colleagues are very, very concerned about looking out for a potential second peak as we move into the autumn, and of course that's the same time that we start having people presenting with other symptoms which could confuse people - so flu symptoms vary, obviously, and also when our hospitals get busier."" On the question of vaccines, she said she believed one would be found, but not this year. Diners will get a 50% discount off their restaurant bill during August under government plansto bolster the embattled hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the ""eat out to help out"" discount as part of a series of measures to restart the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The deal means people can get up to Â£10 off per head if they eat out between Monday and Wednesday. Mr Sunak also said VAT on hospitality and tourism would drop to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Sport The latest round of coronavirus testing in the English Football League has again returned no positive results. A total of 3,498 players and club staff from the Championship and League One were tested over the past week. No League Two tests were carried out as the 2019-20 season concluded following Northampton's win against Exeter in the play-off final on 29 June. It is now two weeks since three individuals from two Championship clubs tested positive for coronavirus. Carlisle's MP says a cluster of coronavirus cases along Cumbria's border with Scotland has been dealt with efficiently by health officials on both sides, in spite of differences in Covid-19 policies. The remaining extra lockdown restrictions just over the Cumbrian border in Dumfries and Galloway have now been lifted by the Scottish government. They were imposed after a cluster of Covid-19 cases were found in the area, thought to have been linked to another outbreak at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle. Conservative MP John Stevenson says it showed devolution and the border could be a problem. We are a region and Carlisle's very much at the centre of that, and there's a lot of interaction between people over on the Scottish side and on the English side. I think it's very difficult to to isolate either side of the border and I think that's been one of the slight problems in Scottish government and UK government taking a slightly different approach to this crisis."" John Stevenson Reality Check Stamp duty, the tax on buying land or properties, is being temporarily cut in England and Northern Ireland. From now until 31 March it will only be charged on properties costing Â£500,000 or more. Previously it was charged on properties costing Â£125,000 or more, except for first-time buyers, who paid nothing up to Â£300,000 and then a reduced rate up to Â£500,000. So this will be a tax cut for first-time buyers looking for property over Â£300,000 and other buyers going for anything over Â£125,000 (there are different rules for people buying second homes). The Halifax says the average price paid by a first-time buyer was Â£231,455 - so the average first-time buyer would not benefit. Figures from Zoopla suggest that at the moment 16% of sales in England were exempt from stamp duty last year â they reckon that would have been 89% if anything up to Â£500,000 had been exempt. You can read more about the stamp duty holiday here. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a temporary stamp duty holiday to stimulate the property market. The tax is normally paid by people buying properties over Â£125,000, although it varies slightly across the UK. It will now apply to the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland. Raising the level until next March could boost the property market and help buyers struggling because of the coronavirus crisis. Allow Twitter content?

Boohoo has launched a review of its UK supply chain after a series of allegations over the conditions at factories where its clothes are made. The board said it was ""shocked and appalled"" by a Sunday Times report which claimed workers at a Leicester factory were paid Â£3.50 an hour and offered no protection from coronavirus. The company has appointed Alison Levitt QC to look into the supply chain in the UK and promised to ""rebuild the reputation of the textile manufacturing industry in Leicester"". In a statement, Boohoo management said: ""We take extremely seriously all allegations of malpractice, poor working conditions, and underpayment of workers. ""The group will not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance with its code of conduct or any mistreatment of workers, and will not hesitate to terminate relationships with any supplier who does not comply."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a plan to keep furloughed workers in their jobs when the scheme ends in October. If employers keep workers in their jobs until January 2021 they will get a Â£1,000 bonus per employee. The scheme could cost as much as Â£9bn if every furloughed worker is covered, the chancellor told MPs. It is part of a package to prevent mass unemployment as the coronavirus crisis hits the economy.

"Fast fashion brand Boohoo has ordered an independent review of its UK supply chain following reports of poor working conditions at a factory in Leicester. It comes after retailers Next and Asos dropped Boohoo goods from their stores amid claims workers were underpaid and not socially distancing. The firm is also facing calls for a boycott on social media. Boohoo, which said it was ""appalled"" by the allegations, has asked a senior barrister to lead the review. It comes after a Sunday Times report claimed workers at a Leicester factory that supplied clothes to Boohoo were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. The factory was also said to be operating during a localised lockdown designed to stop a spike in Covid-19 cases in Leicester. Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, has separately claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were ""forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". Boohoo said it took ""extremely seriously all allegations of malpractice, poor working conditions, and underpayment of workers"". It said that Alison Levitt, a senior barrister who specialises in business crime, would lead an investigation looking into whether the company's suppliers pay the minimum wage, and comply with coronavirus safety regulations, working hours rules and immigration law. Big problem at Leicester factories, say workers Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando Boohoo swoops again to snap up Oasis and Warehouse brands It will also spend an initial Â£10m ""to eradicate supply chain malpractice"", with the help of audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas.

Mr Stewart says: ""As the chancellor made clear this is just the next step in our recovery programme."" Further measures will be brought in at the right point he says and the Â£30bn announced today comes on top of all the other measures the UK government has announced already, he says. The UK government  minister encourages the first minister now to do all she can to make sure the tourism and hospitality sectors don't suffer a ""three winter period"" in Scotland. Mr Stewart argues that the""eat out to help out"" discountwill help the sector return. On the Scottish government announcementon air bridges,he says he has not seen any evidence to suggest Spain as a whole is not safe to travel to. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes says today'spackage of measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunakgives the Scottish government ""neither the powers nor the funding to tailor our response to the Scottish economyâ. ""Whilst there are
elements we welcome, particularly the focus on jobs, and the temporary cut to
VAT, my hopes have certainly been dashed because it would appear a lot of the substantial
decisions have been delayed until the autumn,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. Of the Â£30bn announced, the
Scottish government will only receive Â£21m, she says, which is ""less than 0.1%"". Ms Forbes and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had called for an Â£80bn package equivalent to 4% of GDP, as is happening in Germany. ""The
Â£30bn today doesnât even come to half of that,"" points out the finance secretary, who said she - along with counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland - has asked the Treasury on Tuesday for ""minor fiscal flexibilities"" to allow the devolved nations to
respond individually. ""Essentially todayâs announcement
bypasses devolution completely and doesnât provide that funding or the powers,â Ms Forbes added. A total of 4,173 Scots
deaths have been linked to Covid-19 as of 5 July, official figures show. TheNational Records of Scotland (NRS) figures,externalindicate that is an increase of 17 deaths from
the previous week. From 29 June to 5 July, 40 fewer deaths from all causes were registered compared with the average number for this time of year. New analysis of deaths registered up to 14 June shows that deaths among people from the South Asian ethnic group were almost twice as likely to involve Covid-19 than deaths in the White ethnic group, after accounting for age group, sex, area deprivation and urban/rural classification. The NRS weekly figures are higher than the daily figure announced by Nicola Sturgeon because they include all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested.

Ryanair's terms state that if you suffer from a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a face mask, you are exempted ""on provision of a medical certificate attesting your condition.â But her doctor is currently refusing to provide her with one, based on Scottish government guidance that an exemption letter is not required. ""I thought I would get into the habit because I would be wearing one for five to six hours, but when I tried one on in the shop, it just made
me feel very panicky,"" the woman told BBC Scotland's Drivetime. ""I have felt claustrophobic before, but have never had a panic attack. This was just
awful. Now the thought of putting it on makes me feel so anxious.""

The move to ease quarantine rules from Friday means Scots can travel to a number of countries without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, although Spain is not included on the list. Ken McNabb, managing director of the Travel Company Edinburgh says it is a ""major step forward"" for those in the travel industry. ""I appreciate Spain has had a surge in coronavirus cases, as has Serbia, so there is just cause to leave these out,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland ""Moving people into these countries [on the approved list] is fine, we've got a lot of people we can cover. ""I'm quite sure the majority of travel agencies around the country will be whooping and shouting with joy. We've got this door opened to get people away."" So people travelling to and from Spain will still have to go into quarantine when arriving in Scotland. However the Scottish government has approved almost all of the ""air bridge"" travel destinations set out by UK ministers. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports which owns and
manages Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said: âTodayâs announcement means airlines
can now start making decisions on what flights they will operate, however, the
glaring omission is Spain which accounts for 60% of our leisure flights. âWeâve requested a meeting with
the Scottish government to discuss what further measures could be put in place
that would allow the lifting of restrictions and prevent airlines from
cancelling routes to what is one of Scotlandâs most popular and important
tourism destinations.â From Friday, travellers are exempt from quarantine rules when they arrive in Scotland from: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Croatia, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan The Vatican City made the list but Spain and Serbia did not Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, RÃ©union, San Marino, Seychelles, South Korea, St BarthÃ©lemy, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Pierre and Miquelon, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Vatican City, Vietnam. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Barry McCulloch, the senior policy advisor for the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, thinks overall he got what he wanted from Rishi Sunak. Mr McCulloch tells Drivetime: ""I think overall it struck the right chord and provided some good news that has been in short supply for three months."" The chancellor announcedan ""eat out to help out"" scheme which offers a 50% discount for every diner, up to Â£10 a head, from Monday to Wednesday throughout August. Gino Stornaiuolo, who owns a couple of Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which will participate in the scheme says: ""This is going to further encourage people to hopefully come out and dine."" Mr Stornaiuolo says if his restaurants can do a bit more business from Monday to Wednesday that will be a great help. In response to the six-month VAT cut for restaurants, hotels and attractions, the restaurateur says: ""I'll take any VAT cut."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So what has the reaction been to the chancellor's announcements around Scotland? Alan Henderson, who owns several pubs, restaurants and a hotel in Aberdeen. tells Drivetime: ""Clearly it's great news for the hospitality sector. ""We're probably the sector that's suffered as much as anyone."" Mr Henderson says: ""It's a real shot in the arm and I totally endorse the chancellor's comments, the hospitality sector employs a lot of young people."" He applauds the chancellor's efforts to create and keep jobs for the young. Rishi Sunak The Chancellor has said his package of measures aimed at limiting the economic impact of coronavirus are ""absolutely vital"" for Scotland. Rishi Sunak said many rural areas of Scotland would particularly benefit from a cut to VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector. And he said Scotland would now receive a total of Â£4.6bn in additional Barnett funding from the UK government. The figure had been put at Â£3.6bn by the UK government before his statement. The Scottish government welcomed parts of Mr Sunak's announcement, but accused him of showing a lack of ambition by not introducing the Â£80bn stimulus package it had called for. Many of the measures unveiled by Mr Sunak will apply in Scotland, including the ""job retention bonus"" that will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for at least three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland ""At least we have clarity,"" says travel agent Shona Thorne on the Scottish government's publication of countries from where travellers will be exempt from quarantine rules. She does express surprise at Spain not being included, telling BBC Radio Scotland: ""That caught most of us out."" Ms Thorne believes airlines will avoid any knee-jerk reaction since the list is to be reviewed again on 20 July and flights will not resume in earnest until 15 July. ""There are lots of questions around quarantine,"" she explains. ""We're asking customers to be patient in the short term."" It is also important to remember that there are several nations on the list that UK residents cannot enter presently - or will be subject to testing or quarantine on arrival, she stresses.

He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. ""The stakes could not be higher,"" Mr Wray said.

""We've now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,"" Mr Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China."" The FBI director mentioned a programme called ""Fox Hunt"", which he said President Xi Jinping had ""spearheaded"" and he said was geared at Chinese nationals living abroad seen as threats to the Chinese government. ""We're talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations,"" he said. ""The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China's tactics to accomplish that are shocking."" 'I'm Asian, so I can never be American' Coronavirus: The US-China battle behind the scenes He continued: ""When it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide."" The programme was originally begun in 2015 to target people accused of corruption and has reportedly led to the capture of thousands of fugitives. However,reports of extraordinary rendition of political opponents by Beijing have multiplied in recent years, starting with Gui Minhai, one of a group of Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in Chinese custody. Unlike the others, Mr Gui disappeared abroad - in Thailand - rather than from Hong Kong itself. China is fast becoming a new kind of threat to the West, not so much because of its growing military capabilities - though that is a factor - but because in economic and technical terms it is already a peer competitor of the United States, and a peer competitor in a very different kind of world. Nineteenth Century great powers competed more or less on equal terms but operated in a far less integrated international system. In the second half of the 20th Century, the Soviet Union was a peer military competitor of the United States, but with a relatively weak economy largely isolated from the wider international system. China, however, has huge and growing economic muscle. It shares much of the same economic space with the West and its dominance of crucial supply chains - think medical PPE for example - only enhances its power. The level of integration of today's globalised world and the importance of data and information only act as force multipliers for Beijing's overt and covert global reach. In the unusual address, Mr Wray asked Chinese-born people living in the US to contact the FBI if Chinese officials target them seeking their return. The Chinese government has defended this programme in the past, saying it is part of a legitimate anti-corruption effort. The threat posed by China will be further addressed by the US attorney general and secretary of state in coming weeks, Mr Wray said. This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US The address comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China. US President Donald Trump has been highly critical of China amid the coronavirus outbreak, repeatedly blaming the country for the global pandemic. In another move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the administration was looking at banning Chinese apps - including the hugely popular TikTok. The apps ""serve as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state"", he said.

"Olalekan Jacob Ponle, known as ""mrwoodbery"" to his Instagram followers, flaunted his wealth The day after his 29th birthday in May, Olalekan Jacob Ponle posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to a bright yellow Lamborghini in Dubai. ""Stop letting people make you feel guilty for the wealth you've acquired,"" he admonished, wearing designer jewellery and Gucci clothes from head to toe. A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name ""mrwoodbery"" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, ""hushpuppi"" or just ""hush"" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (Â£32m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims.

Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,"" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC. It is a spectacular crash for the two Nigerian men who extensively documented their high-flying lifestyle on social media, raising questions about the sources of their wealth. They unwittingly provided crucial information about their identities and activities for American detectives with their Instagram and Snapchat posts. They are accused of impersonating legitimate employees of various US companies in ""business email compromise"" (BEC) schemes and tricking the recipients into wiring millions of dollars into their own accounts. On Instagram, hushpuppi said he was a real estate developer and had a category of videos called ""Flexing"" - social media lingo for showing off. But the ""houses"" were actually a codeword for bank accounts ""used to receive proceeds of a fraudulent scheme"", investigators allege. ""Our value system in Nigeria needs to be checked, especially the emphasis we place on wealth, no matter how you got it,"" the economist Ebuka Emebinah told the BBC from New York. ""It's a culture where people believe that results speak for you. We don't place as much emphasis on the process and this has built up over time."" In April, hushpuppi renewed his lease for another year at the exclusive Palazzo Versace apartments in Dubai under his real name and phone number. ""Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life. Continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed,"" he captioned an Instagram picture of a Rolls-Royce just a fortnight before he was arrested. ""Abbas finances this opulent lifestyle through crime, and he is one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitates computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes (including BEC schemes), and money laundering, targeting victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said in an affidavit.

In one case, a foreign financial institution allegedly lost $14.7m in a cyber-heist where the money ended up in hushpuppi's bank accounts in multiple countries. The affidavit also alleged that he was involved in a scheme to steal $124m from an unnamed English Premier League team. The FBI obtained records from his Google, Apple iCloud, Instagram and Snapchat accounts which allegedly contained banking information, passports, communication with conspirators and records of wire transfers. About 90% of business email compromise scams originate in West Africa, research from American email security firm Agari shows. The complaint against Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle describe tactics that resemble what the company calls Vendor Email Compromise tactics, where scammers compromise an email account and study communication between a customer and a vendor. ""The scammer would gather contextual details, as they watched the legitimate email flow,"" explains Crane Hassold, Agari's senior director of threat research. ""The bad actor would redirect emails to the bad actor's email account, craft emails to the customer that looked like they are coming from the vendor, indicate that the 'vendor' had a new bank account, provide 'updated' bank account information and the money would be gone, at that point."" Mr Ponle, known online as ""mrwoodberry"", used Mark Kain in emails, according to the FBI. He is accused of defrauding a Chicago-based company into sending wire transfers of $15.2m. Companies in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and California are also said to have fallen victim. The cash trail allegedly disappeared after his accomplices, called money mules, converted the money into the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Email scams have become so prevalent globally, and so deeply linked to Nigeria, that the fraudsters have a name in the country: ""Yahoo boys"". They try to convince a recipient to wire money to the other side of the world or they go ""phishing"", stealing a user's identity and personal information for fraud. The FBI warns against the Nigerian letter or ""419"" fraud - emails promising large sums of money, called advance fee scams. The ""Nigerian prince"" trope has become shorthand for deception. An individual may contact you via e-mail, explaining he needs help to transfer money Will tell you that political turmoil or a natural disaster makes it difficult for him to make the transfer Will ask you to give him your financial details so that he can transfer the money into your account This allows him to access and steal from your account Be careful what you post on social media and dating sites as scammers use the details to better understand you and target you A Washington, DC-based attorney, Moe Odele, finds it frustrating as a Nigerian because it ignores the ""systemic failures that have led to brilliant Nigerian youths engaging in these scams"", in the country and abroad. ""They see it as an easy way out in a country that offers them limited options and, in many cases, no options at all,"" she says. ""But there are also many brilliant Nigerians are represented in world stages from education to pop culture."" Last month, the US Treasury Department blacklisted six Nigerians among 79 individuals and organisations in its Most Wanted cybercriminals list. It accused them of stealing more than $6m from American citizens through deceptive global threats like BEC and romance fraud.

""A lot of Nigerians are doing fantastic things all over the world, but they don't get as much media mileage as the guys doing bad things. It affects all the guys doing legitimate stuff especially in the tech space,"" he said. ""A lot of foreign companies don't ship to Nigeria, many payment platforms don't accept payments from us because it has ruined our image."" In its internet crime report for 2019,external, the FBI said it had received more than 460,000 complaints of suspected cyber fraud, with losses of more than $3.5bn reported. More than $300m was recovered, it said. However, many online fraudsters don't get caught and even fewer end up going to jail. Mr Donath says the cases are challenging because they happen overseas and tend to be quite sophisticated. ""They're time-consuming, highly document-intensive, and in many federal criminal cases, you have the difficulty of walking a jury through a chronology of relevant facts,"" said the partner at law firm Clifford Chance. If convicted, Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle could be locked up for up to 20 years.

"Public Health Wales, supported by the Army, spent two hours swabbing everyone at Claremont Court Care Home in Newport Care homes have been ""badly let down"" during the coronavirus pandemic and the Welsh Government has been too slow to respond, a report has said. The Senedd's health committee described Wales' testing policy in care homes at the start of the outbreak as ""flawed"". It said it took ""too long"" to start ""appropriate testing measures"". Care homes account for 28% ofWales' 2,438 coronavirus deaths. The Welsh Government said it did not accept residents had been let down. ""The Senedd's health committee has focused on testing, which is just one part of our response,"" a spokesman said. ""We have provided a wide range of support, including extra nursing staff where necessary and free PPE [personal protective equipment] for care homes across Wales."" How do we protect care homes as lockdown eases? Almost 30,000 'excess' care homes deaths How well Wales coped with the pandemic, including whether there was adequate PPE and effective testing policies was explored by the cross-party committee. The crisis ""exposed serious weaknesses that existed in many areas"", its report said. However, it added: ""A second wave does not have to be inevitable if the lessons of the last few months are properly learned and fully applied."" This video can not be played Nearly one-fifth of residents at Tregwilym Lodge died in the space of a month Early in the outbreak, 1,097 patients were discharged from hospitals to care homes without being tested for Covid-19. Care home residents with symptoms, and those being discharged from hospital, were not routinely tested until 29 April. On 16 May it was announced that all residents and staff, regardless of whether they had symptoms, could be tested. The committee points out this was ""considerably later than both England (28 April) and Scotland (1 May)"" took the same decision. Wales' initial approach was ""flawed, and... it was subsequently too slow in responding to the mounting crisis"", the report adds. It said: ""We are deeply troubled by the number of Covid-related deaths in care homes. Care homes look after some of our oldest and most vulnerable members of society. ""They deserve to be protected in the event of a national health emergency, yet they have been badly let down during this crisis."" Parkside House Residential Home in Penarth says it has kept the virus at bay Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said policies are based on scientific advice - andthere was no evidence that discharging people from hospitals to care homes without tests led to more deaths. But the report said decisions to reverse the original testing policy, later than happened in England and Scotland, came ""at great cost to the social care sector"". The report also said there was a lack of PPE at the start of the outbreak and it was ""extremely concerning"" Wales has - at times -come within days of running out. Other concerns included the fact vulnerable people who were asked to shield from the disease did not always get clear information and the UK-wide decision to abandon contact tracing early in the crisis was ""devastating"". It said the Welsh Government should now make sure it has an ""efficient and effectively functioning contact tracing system"". A Welsh Government spokesman said its approach had been ""rooted in scientific evidence with the sole objective of saving lives, regardless of where people live"". ""Everyone working in social care has worked tirelessly to protect some of the most vulnerable people in Wales,"" he added. ""We will continue to work with the sector to identify and provide any additional support it needs to respond to the virus."" Care Forum Wales, which represents the industry, said some of its members felt under pressure to admit hospital patients who had not been tested. Chairman Mario Kreft said: ""This report is essentially confirming what we knew already and what Care Forum Wales has been saying for months that essentially care homes, their residents and staff inadvertently became collateral damage in a drive to protect the NHS from being overrun.""

"June Wray had chronic pain after a vaginal mesh repair Many lives have been ruined because officials failed to hear the concerns of women given drugs and procedures that caused them or their babies considerable harm, saysa review,external. More than 700 women and their families shared ""harrowing"" details about vaginal mesh, pregnancy test Primodos and epilepsy drug sodium valproate. Too often worries and complaints were dismissed as ""women's problems"". It said arrogant attitudes left women traumatised, intimidated and confused. The patients who fought for answers 'No-one believed my pain' Review chair Baroness Julia Cumberlege said she was shocked by the ""sheer scale"" and ""intensity of suffering"". She said: ""I have conducted many reviews and inquiries over the years, but I have never encountered anything like this. ""Much of this suffering was entirely avoidable, caused and compounded by failings in the health system itself."" She said even now the exact numbers of women affected by the three issues was still not known and praised campaigners for fighting to raise the problems. The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and support organs The cases span decades and are thought to affect hundreds of thousands of women and babies. The review looked at three treatments: Primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test, withdrawn from the market in the 1978, which is thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages. The manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, has always denied a link between the drug and deformities in babies. Sodium valproate - an epilepsy drug which, while effective for preventing seizures, can be harmful if taken during pregnancy, causing physical abnormalities to the baby in the womb as well as developmental delay and autism in children whose mothers took it. Pelvic mesh implants - used as a surgical option to treat prolapse and incontinence, some women say they have been left with internal damage and agonising chronic pain ""like razors inside the body"". In the last few years, the procedure has only been offered on the NHS under exceptional circumstances and high vigilance. The mesh is made of a polypropylene, a type of plastic The review has set out the missed opportunities when something could or should have been done to prevent harm. It said there was a culture of denial by a disjointed and defensive healthcare system that failed to listen to patients' concerns. Hundreds of babies are being born each year to mothers ""unaware"" of the risks that sodium valproate can pose in pregnancy, said the review. While some women have benefited from mesh implants, others have been left in agony. Kate Langley, Marie Lyon and June Wray have all been affected June Wray, 73 and from Newcastle, experienced chronic pain after having a vaginal mesh procedure in 2009. ""Sometimes the pain is so severe, I feel like I will pass out,"" she said. ""But when I told GPs and surgeons, they didn't believe me. They just looked at me like I was mad."" Kate Langley had a mesh fitted in 2012 for incontinence problems. She said it had had a massive impact on her life, leading to more than 50 admissions to hospital when she was in acute pain. ""It was so hard to deal with. Years of going from one doctor to another."" She has now had four operations to remove the mesh. Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos when she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born with a shortened arm. She began campaigning in 1978 and said the review was a ""relief that there has finally been an acknowledgement"" of the situation. Mrs Lyon, chairwoman of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, said there was also ""great sadness"" that many of the original campaign members were not alive to see the result of the review. The review warned against pushing innovative treatments without enough long-term monitoring, and criticises manufacturers for being motivated by sales ahead of safety. And it recommended: Appointing an independent patient safety commissioner to hold the health system to account Setting up discretionary payment schemes to meet the financial care costs of those already affected Creating a redress agency to help resolve future disputes Transparency of payments made to doctors by pharmaceutical and medical device companies Kath Sansom, founder of Sling the Mesh campaign and a mother of two, said: ""The report is hard hitting and recognises the total failure in patient safety, regulation and oversight in the UK. ""It also makes it very clear that our medical establishment is deeply entrenched in institutional denial and misogyny. ""While we welcome all of the recommendations, there is no glory in knowing thousands of women have been maimed by mesh since the late 1990s then ignored when they asked for help suffering debilitating, life altering and irreversible pain."" Epilepsy Action deputy chief executive Simon Wigglesworth said: ""Nothing can undo the avoidable harm and distress that has been caused by the decades of government silence and inaction."" Health Minister Nadine Dorries said she was determined to make the changes needed to protect women in the future. ""Our health system must learn from those it has failed. ""We will now give this independent review the full and careful consideration it deserves before setting out our full response.""

"Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) must be guaranteed ahead of winter when the UK could face a second wave of coronavirus, say MPs. The cross-party committee says it is not convinced there is a robust plan or ""sufficient urgency"" from government. It comes after anofficial assessmentof the supply and distribution of PPE in England between March and May highlighted shortcomings. Nationally, PPE stocks never ran out, says the government. But there were some shortages, including the supply of gowns. The Commons Public Accounts Committee called on ministers to come forward with a detailed plan within two months, setting out how they intended to keep the NHS and the care sector fully supplied in future. The business leader brought in by the government to sort out shortages of PPE, Lord Paul Deighton, recently told the BBC that supplies were now stable and had been secured for the rest of the year. Has the NHS got enough PPE? Tsar says PPE shortage crisis is over Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, global demand for PPE has been at unprecedented levels. Much of the PPE used in the UK is bought from overseas suppliers. As of5 July,external, the Department of Health and Social Care had distributed more than 2.2 billion items of PPE for use by health and social care services in England. That compares with 2.43bn for the whole of 2019, pre-coronavirus. Almost 28 billion items of PPE have been ordered overall from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply in the coming months. Temporary scrapping of VAT on PPE has been extended until the end of October to make it easier and cheaper for care homes, charities and businesses to acquire the vital kit. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We do not accept these claims. We have been working around the clock to deliver PPE to the frontline throughout this global pandemic, working with industry, the NHS and the armed forces to create a distribution network to supply over 58,000 settings. ""We will continue to give the NHS whatever it needs and protect it for the future. We have written off Â£13.4bn of NHS hospital debt, recently announced another Â£1.5bn of capital investment, and we will deliver 50,000 more nurses by end of this Parliament.""
