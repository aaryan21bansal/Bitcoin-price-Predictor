"Monoclonal antibodies attacking coronavirus The UK's ""most vulnerable"" hospital patients, who are unable to build up an antibody response to Covid, will be offered new drug Ronapreve from Monday. The new Covid treatment, approved just last month, uses a pair of laboratory-made antibodies to attack the virus. It was famously used as part of the suite of experimental medicines given to US President Donald Trump last year. The antibody cocktail has been shown to reduce hospital stays by four days and cut the risk of death by a fifth. The government said it had secured sufficient supply of the new therapeutic for eligible NHS patients across the four nations to cover the forthcoming winter. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he was ""thrilled it will be saving lives from as early as next week"". ""The UK is leading the world in identifying and rolling out life-saving medicines, particularly for Covid 19, and we will continue our vital work to find the best treatments available to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said. Covid-antibody therapy approved in UK Which treatments work best against Covid? All the medication Trump is taking, explained The new treatment is expensive and priority will be given to those patients at greatest risk of becoming severely ill. It will be offered to those over-50 without the necessary antibodies, and those aged 12-49 who are immuno-compromised - for example those with certain cancers - who struggle to mount an antibody response, either through being exposed to Covid, or from vaccination. The government said guidance would be sent to clinicians imminently so they can begin prescribing the treatment as soon as possible. Of those eligible patients, antibody testing will initially be used to determine whether they are seronegative - meaning those who do not have an adequate existing antibody response - and will therefore be eligible for treatment. The treatment antibodies - casirivimab and imdevimab - will then be administered to patients through a drip. The drug works by binding to the virus' spike protein, stopping it from being able to infect the body's cells. The antibody therapy attacks the virus, unlike other Covid treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone that calm the body's overactive immune system. There had been concern the idea was a dud after trials failed when antibodies were taken from patients who had recovered from Covid. However, the companies Regeneron and Roche tested monoclonal antibodies in the laboratory to find the two that were best able to stick to the virus. This has proved far more effective, and the therapy continues to work against new variants. ""Ronapreve is the first dedicated medicine developed for Covid 19 to receive marketing authorisation from the MHRA, representing a significant milestone in how the NHS is able to fight this disease,"" said Paul McManus, Covid 19 lead at Roche Products Ltd. ""We're grateful for the collaboration of the vaccine taskforce and NHS England in helping to bring this important antibody cocktail to treat and prevent acute Covid 19 across the UK.""

"David Gomoh was stabbed at least nine times Four gang members have received life sentences for the murder of a ""charismatic and intelligent"" NHS worker who died in front of his family. David Gomoh, 24, staggered home after being stabbed while on the phone to his girlfriend in Canning Town, east London, in April 2020. He had no links to any gangs but was randomly targeted as part of a feud. His death was part of a ""petty but fatal game of one-upmanship"" played out on the streets, the Old Bailey heard. Muhammad Jalloh, 19, from Stratford, east London, and Vagnei Colubali, 23, from Cambridge, were jailed for a minimum of 27 years. David Ture, 19, of no fixed address, was given 26 years and Alex Melaku, 18, of Telford, 21 years. Melaku only became an adult one day before sentencing, meaning he has been identified for the first time. (L to R): Vagnei Colubali, David Ture, Mohammad Jalloh and Alex Melaku have been jailed for life All four defendants were also sentenced to concurrent terms for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to an unidentified man who escaped. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, the Recorder of London, said the killers had carried out a ""brutal murder"" which had involved a ""significant degree"" of planning. Mr Gomoh, a marketing graduate, who worked in procurement for the health service, had been in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"", he added. In a victim impact statement, his mother Marian said she was ""haunted"" by recurring nightmares about what happened, adding: ""I felt numb, paralysed by grief and pain. Why David?"" She said the ""psychological and emotional torture escalated"" during the trial, as she listened to details of what happened to her ""beautiful son"". She said her son's murderers had ""walked uninvited into our lives and destroyed David's life"". Mr Gomoh as a boy The defendants have ""wrecked our family"", she said, adding: ""Their contempt for a human life is just beyond comprehension."" His sister Lizzie paid tribute to her ""fun-loving, amazing brother"", adding that his death had had a ""devastating impact on us all"". She said: ""It still feels so raw and so fresh."" Referring to her brother's killers, she said: ""I hope they will eventually show remorse."" Det Ch Insp Laurence Smith described it as a ""senseless attack on a completely innocent man"". He said: ""Despite the significant evidence linking them to this crime, all four refused to admit to their actions, meaning David's family and friends had to sit through a trial and relive the worst night of their lives.""

"This video can not be played 'It isn't a neutral statement politically' Irish President Michael D Higgins has continued to defend his decision not to attend a church service to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland. The Queen is among the guests due to attend the event in Armagh on 21 October, and Mr Higgins denied that his decision was a snub to the Queen. He said he declined the invite because the event had become politicised. President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. The Armagh church service has been organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". Speaking in Rome, where he met Pope Francis on Friday, President Higgins said he felt the title ""wasn't a neutral statement politically"". He explained that he had been considering the invitation for about six months, and in the week before St Patrick's Day, he shared his concerns with the organisers of the event. President Higgins said he recalled saying: ""We must do everything we can to support each other's events, but if this event is titled as it is, and structured as it is, it would present difficulties."" During an interview with theIrish Times,externalon Thursday, President Higgins also said he had been incorrectly referred to as the president of the Republic of Ireland in the invitation rather than the president of Ireland. However, in the press conference in Rome, he corrected his earlier statement about how he had been titled. ""I do want to clarify one point in my interview yesterday with Harry [McGee], that I may be responsible for creating a small confusion, and that is - the organisers writing to my office have always referred to me as president of Ireland,"" he said. ""The reference to the president of the Republic of Ireland is really the remark of the leadership of the DUP."" Pope Francis with Irish President Michael D Higgins during his visit to the Vatican on Friday morning President Higgins insisted that he had been a ""regular"" visitor to Northern Ireland and ""had no difficulties appearing in Northern Ireland with Her Majesty"". He explained that his decision to decline the invitation was not a sudden one, saying he had given the matter proper consideration. ""When you are president, and you are responsible for the long vision you have to take all of the consequences into account and all of the interpretations, and I did that,"" he said. The president also took issue with some commentators who had criticised his decision not to attend the Armagh event and those who were ""telling me what I have to do"". In his newspaper interview on Thursday, the president said he was ""not snubbing anyone and I am not part of anyone's boycott or any other events in Northern Ireland"". ""I wish their service well but they understand that I have the right to exercise discretion as to what I think is appropriate,"" he added. DUP asks Higgins to rethink centenary invite Irish president declines invite to NI100 service The president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a ""disappointing and retrograde step"". However, President Higgins said criticism from the DUP was ""a bit much"". ""I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events. There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now."" Sir Jeffrey said the president's comments were ""not conducive to reconciliation"" and added that he was disappointed by his remarks about the DUP. President Higgins with the Queen, who has also been invited to the service, during a state visit to the UK in 2014 He told BBC Radio UIster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday morning that the church service was intended to mark the event of the centenary and ""reflect where we are"". ""It is not just my party that has raised this as a concern. unionists will be disappointed,"" he said. ""Failing to recognise the existence of Northern Ireland does not help anybody."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, however, tweeted that the partition of Ireland had been a ""catastrophe for our people and our country"". Allow Twitter content?

She added: ""The partition of Ireland costs us to this day, holds us back, divides us. UachtarÃ¡n na hÃireann has made clear his decision not to attend a commemorative event. His decision is the correct one."" Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Declan Kearney, speaking at another centenary event held in Belfast on Friday, said the party had not yet received an invitation to October's church service but added: ""If we do so, we too will be declining it."" The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland said it would have been ""very special"" if President Higgins was able to attend the church service and said his absence was ""unexpected"". Archbishop Eamon Martin added that the event was ""completely non-political"" and was intended to provide a moment for prayer and reflection. Newly appointed Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, also in attendance at the Union Theological College service, said it was ""a matter for the president of the Irish Republic to decide what diary commitments he accepts and what he doesn't"". ""We will carry on marking a very historic, inclusive event for all communities in Northern Ireland,"" he added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called for political leaders across the island to ""pause and reflect on the weight of their words"". He said ""cynical criticism"" of President Higgins' decision not to attend the event would ""not advance the cause of reconciliation, particularly when it comes from quarters that have downplayed and degraded the importance of all-island cooperation for two decades"". ""I would respectfully ask that those for whom this is disappointing reflect on the honest remarks made by President Higgins last night and understand the views of those for whom partition is not a cause for celebration or commemoration,"" he added. Once elected Irish presidents, like the Queen, are rarely criticised and are expected to be above daily politics. So, it is no surprise there has been to date a largely muted reaction south of the border to President Higgins' decision not to attend the centenary event organised by the four main Christian churches. Those few voices that have asked him to reconsider his position have done so in the name of north-south reconciliation - a cause he would argue he has been to the forefront of with hisfirst state visit to the UK by an Irish president. Those who support his decision say no head of state of any country could acquiesce to an event that marked the partitioning of his country and caused huge harm. In past comments, President Higgins, who was a left-wing politician, has spoken about ""ethical remembrance"" and reminding the British of their role in colonialism and imperialism and the legacy of that for descendants. While his non-attendance at the event has been criticised by unionist and other politicians, it is unlikely to damage his reputation south of the border where the controversy is largely seen as - at least until now - a ""political bubble"" story. Responding to President Higgins' explanation for not attending the church service, Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt said he had previously admired the president's outreach. ""If there was a problem with language then there is no reason why the presidential support staff could not have opened a quiet back channel to resolve all issues of language,"" he said. He added that the issue had the potential to ""infect good relations and reconciliation"". Alliance MP Stephen Farry previously called on President Higgins to reconsider his decision, saying the event was ""very much in keeping with the reconciliation efforts of successive Irish presidents and the Queen"". Simon Coveney says the government did not give ""clear advice"" on whether or not President Higgins should attend Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney travelled to Belfast on Friday to continue talks with Stormont parties as the controversy over the service continues. Speaking ahead of another event to mark the centenary organised by the Presbyterian church, he confirmed the Irish government had been consulted about the president's invitation to the church service. But he said there was no ""clear advice"" given on whether or not he should attend. He added President Higgins had made his own decision and that had to be respected. The Irish government previously said the issue of attendance at the service was a matter for the president alone and any invitation for a government representative to attend would be considered.

"Keira Bell (centre) said she should have been challenged more when she decided to transition to male Doctors can judge if under-16s can give informed consent to puberty blocker use,the Court of Appeal has ruled.,external The appeal was brought by the Tavistock Trust, which runs the UK's only youth gender identity clinic. The decision reverses a 2020 ruling that under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment, which delays the onset of puberty. The original case was brought by Keira Bell, who says the clinic should have challenged her more over transitioning. She said she was disappointed by the decision, and will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. Court of Appeal judges said they recognised ""the difficulties and complexities"" of the issue, but that ""it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgement knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances"". Puberty blockers are drugs used to ""pause"" puberty by suppressing the release of hormones. They are prescribed to some children who are experiencing gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as ""a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"". Ms Bell says she will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court The Tavistock clinic said it welcomed the decision. ""The judgement upholds established legal principles which respect the ability of our clinicians to engage actively and thoughtfully with our patients in decisions about their care and futures,"" a spokesperson said. ""It affirms that it is for doctors, not judges, to decide on the capacity of under-16s to consent to medical treatment."" What are puberty blockers? What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) said that hormone treatment ""allows a young person time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment"". In December 2020, the High Court ruled under-13s were ""highly unlikely"" to be able to give informed consent to what it described as ""experimental"" treatment and it was ""very doubtful"" those aged 14 and 15 would have the sufficient understanding of the implications. Keira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to Gids. She was later prescribed the male hormone testosterone and had surgery to remove her breasts. Now in her mid-20s, she regrets the decision to transition to a male, and feels there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage. She said she had ""no regrets"" about bringing the case, which she said ""shone a light into the dark corners of a medical scandal that is harming children and harmed me. ""I am obviously disappointed with the ruling of the court today, and especially that it did not grapple with the significant risk of harm that children are exposed to by being given powerful experimental drugs."" This a complex, controversial area, yet the Court of Appeal's ruling is very clear. It is for doctors working with families and the children themselves to decide whether that young person can truly understand the implications of taking drugs that could change the course of their life. Effectively this ruling has removed the courts from the decision-making process in all but the most difficult cases. This will be welcomed by many young people struggling with their gender identity, who believe the long wait for treatment that they already face is causing huge distress and harm. But for those like Keira Bell, who believe they weren't challenged enough when they made decisions that shaped their futures, there will be real disappointment. However, the court cases have led to more discussion of the issues - and many will hope that they will also lead to greater understanding. In March, a separate judgement from the court's Family Division had ruled parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers, with other safeguarding measures considered. The Tavistock temporarily paused new referrals to its endocrinology service following the rulings. Eligible under-16s who had already been referred for treatment, and have parental consent, are having their cases reviewed by Gids, with decisions overseen by an independent NHS England review group. The NHS said the findings ofDr Hilary Cass's independent review,externalinto NHS gender identity services for children and young people would shed further light on the issue. The review was announced in September 2020, when it was said it would take ""12 months or possibly longer"". ""The NHS commissioned Dr Hilary Cass to review gender identity services prior to the original High Court ruling to ensure the best model of safe and effective care is delivered - this will set out wide-ranging recommendations including on the use of puberty blockers and the many contested clinical issues identified by the court,"" a spokesperson said. ""An independent multi-professional review group will continue to confirm whether clinical decision making has followed a robust consent process now that the endocrine pathway has been reopened by the Tavistock.""

"The disease attacks the central nervous system of cattle and is usually fatal A case of the cattle disease BSE has been confirmed on a farm in Somerset. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said that the infected animal has died and has been removed. An investigation is under way to find the source of the infection and restrictions on the movement of cattle on the farm have been put in place. ""There is no risk to food safety or public health,"" said chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss. The single case of classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,commonly known as mad cow disease, was confirmed earlier today. ""We recognise this will be a traumatic time for the farmer and we are on hand to offer advice through this difficult period,"" said Ms Middlemiss. ""The UK's overall risk status for BSE remains at 'controlled',"" she added. APHA will now investigate the herd, premises and potential sources of infection. It said that there have been five confirmed cases of BSE in the UK since 2014 and all have been in animals which were not destined for the human food chain and posed no risk to the public.â¯ A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said there are ""strict controls in place"" to protect consumers from the risk of BSE.

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford announced Wales' Covid vaccine passport plans at Friday's press conference People in Wales will need to show a pass proving they have been fully vaccinated or had a negative Covid test to attend clubs and large-scale events. The new rules begin on 11 October. Customers will be able to use an NHS Covid Pass to show they have been vaccinated, or had a negative lateral flow test in the past 48 hours. The pass will be needed for clubs, indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people and outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people. It will also be required for any event with more than 10,000 people. Passes will be available to anyone over the age of 16, though will only be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events. It comes as Public Health Wales (PHW) reported eight further deaths with coronavirus and 2,618 new cases. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Cardiff Bay also said they were disappointed by the move, Plaid Cymru said it was ""perplexed"" by elements of the plan. But Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, who has cancer, said the announcement means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. How do I get a Covid passport in Wales? Welsh sports fans will need Covid passes Packed pilot festival brings the good times back First Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from a nightclub trade body that the move may damage the nightclub industry. ""The last thing we want is further lockdowns and for businesses to have to close their doors once again,"" he said. ""That's why we must take small but meaningful action now to control the spread of the virus and reduce the need for tougher measures later."" The Welsh government rejected the idea of a vaccine-only passport for large-scale events as it would discriminate against those who cannot get a vaccine, Mr Drakeford said in a news conference. The first minister said only allowing the double-jabbed into nightclubs or sports matches raised ""a series of ethical, legal and technical questions"". Scotland is introducing vaccine passports on 1 October, but the Welsh government will use what is calls vaccine passes instead, which allow people to use a negative lateral flow test to gain entry. Under the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to ""prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". Customers will be able to use an NHS Covid Pass to show they have been vaccinated to get into nightclubs and events Graeme Da Silva, regional director at Rekom, which manages the Pryzm and Fiction nightclubs in Cardiff and Swansea, said he was ""frustrated"" with the go-ahead for Covid passports. ""Once again nightclubs are being singled out,"" he said. Mr Da Silva said the move will cost the company money, whether that be in extra staffing or the loss of their walk-up trade. ""There is not much difference between a club and a nightclub at midnight on a Friday or Saturday. People are dancing, people are busy and actually nightclubs are a lot safer because of the ventilation we have. ""First to close, last to open and we've been picked on by the government. Despite all our efforts its been a really tough time for us. ""Our venues are at a really fragile state of recovery and many hundreds of jobs are at risk. ""Our customer and staff safety have been at the forefront of our agendas but, in the interest in fairness, we would have liked to see this across all retail and hospitality which makes it a difficult pill to swallow."" You do not need a pass for restaurants or pubs, which is unfair says one nightclub owner Night Time Industries Association Wales said: ""We are disappointed that the Welsh government has felt it must mandate Covid passports at this stage, albeit a more liberal implementation with the inclusion of testing. ""We still feel that these measures will have a negative impact on businesses, and will create considerable market distortion."" And UK Hospitality's executive director for Wales, David Chapman, said it would be an ""extra burden"" leading to closures and job losses. He said it had made the case against passes because of difficulties including definitions of businesses and conflict with customers, all at the same time as a shortage of staff. ""Those affected businesses, already in a fragile state following repeated lockdowns and periods of onerous trading restrictions, now find themselves facing further economic and resourcing pressures,"" he said. Alys Scourfield (right) and her daughter Lily felt more comfortable when events were socially distanced For Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, the announcement of Covid passes has ""changed her life"". It means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. Mrs Scourfield's ""time is limited"" after her cancer recently spread to her spine. She said she would not go to an event with a large crowd unless she was sure everyone was double jabbed or had a negative test. ""I need to go out for mine and my children's mental health and pretend to be a normal person for the short time I've got left,"" she said. ""This will make me feel much safer and feel that I've done everything I can possibly do to reduce the risk."" The leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he was disappointed by the announcement. ""Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications,"" he said. ""The inclusion of the lateral flow test element eases one area of concern but a whole host remain, particularly regarding the overall effectiveness of this measure and the impact it will have on businesses, jobs and Wales' economic recovery."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said he was ""a bit perplexed about elements of this Covid pass scheme"". ""It's a much broader target base - we're talking about football matches, not just nightclubs, so there are issues of implementation, certainly,"" he said. Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds promised to vote against the scheme if it faces a vote in the Senedd. ""I understand many people want to get back to a sense of normality, but vaccine passports are not the way to do this and we need to be careful about the precedent they set. They are medical ID cards in all but name and Welsh Liberal Democrats will lead the fight against their introduction."" Mark Drakeford stressed people should work from home if possible At Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford also said people should keep working from home where possible. Although the guidance has no legal force, the Welsh government said it wanted to ""reinforce the importance"" of working from home. Many large employers are already using ""hybrid"" models, with staff splitting time between home and the office.

"The relaxation of travel restrictions in England will give airlines a ""shot in the arm"", an industry group has said. Airlines UK welcomed the government simplifying the traffic light system and reducing testing requirements. It said it ""moves us much closer to the reopening of UK aviation"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes would enable more people to travel around the world. From 4 October the amber and green lists will be scrapped in England, leaving a single red list that has been downsized. People who have had both jabs will not need to take a pre-departure test before leaving any country not on the red list. They will also be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper, rapid lateral flow test. UK travel update: Amber list scrapped in overhaul of travel rules in England Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: ""This is a positive step which moves us much closer to the reopening of UK aviation and provides greater reassurance to passengers desperate to travel. ""By reducing the number of red list destinations and scrapping PCR testing, ministers have paved the way for people to get away this October half-term and into the winter following 18 months of uncertainty. ""It will provide a real shot in the arm for a sector that until now has not been allowed to trade properly."" Thomas Cook said it expected the coming weekend to be its best for sales in 2021, adding that customers ""are booking in droves"". ""Based on our bookings already today, I would expect this weekend to be the biggest of the year so far as people take advantage of the great deals on offer, the new easier rules on testing and the simplified system for international travel,"" said David Child, head of PR and brand at the travel firm. The travel and tourism sectors have been among the hardest hit by the Covid pandemic. Globally they have lost 62 million jobs, the World Travel and Tourism Council says. ""We are pleased to see the back of an illogical traffic light system that caused confusion and distress for travellers,"" said Julia Simpson, its president and chief executive. ""While this is certainly a step in the right direction, for the UK to be real leaders, the government should adopt a system based on the risk of individuals, not countries."" The changes ""remove some of the layers of complexity and expense UK holidaymakers have faced this summer"", said Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK. He said Tui had already seen an increase in bookings for Turkey and destinations ""for those looking to enjoy some winter sun"" in October. However, the red list should be reduced further, he said. Virgin Atlantic said: ""We urge the UK Government to use the Prime Minister's upcoming visit to the USA to work with the Biden administration to remove transatlantic restrictions for UK citizens, just as the UK has done for US travellers."" Grant Shapps said: ""Today's changes mean a simpler, more straightforward system. ""Public health has always been at the heart of our international travel policy and with more than eight in ten adults fully vaccinated in the UK, we are now able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new landscape.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China France has said it is recalling its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations, in protest at a security deal which also includes the UK. The French foreign minister said the ""exceptional decision"" was justified by the situation's ""exceptional gravity"". The alliance, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. The move angered France as it scuppered a multibillion-dollar deal it had signed with Australia. The agreement is widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea. It was announced on Wednesday by US President Joe Biden, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. France was informed of the alliance only hours before the public announcement was made. VIEW FROM BRUSSELS:Awkward wake-up call for Europe ANALYSIS:Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED:Tensions in the South China Sea In a statement late on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who had described the pact as a ""stab in the back"", said the ambassadors were being recalled at the request of President Emmanuel Macron. The deal ""constitute[s] unacceptable behaviour between allies and partners whose consequences directly affect the vision we have of our alliances, of our partnerships and of the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe"", Mr Le Drian said. A White House official said the Biden administration regretted the move and would be engaged with France in the coming days to resolve their differences. Speaking in Washington, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she understood the ""disappointment"" in France and hoped to work with the country to ensure it understood ""the value we place on the bilateral relationship"". A recall of ambassadors is highly unusual between allies, and it is believed to be the first time France has recalled envoys from the two countries. French diplomats in Washington had already cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France which was scheduled for Friday. At the ElysÃ©e in Paris, they are concerned that in Washington, Canberra and London officials are underestimating and misinterpreting French anger - which is not about the loss of the submarine contract per se,  but about the way France - an allied nation with a presence in the Pacific - was cut out of the picture in secret talks between the three English-speaking countries. That's why President Macron last night ordered the recall for consultations of the two ambassadors:  to show that from France's perspective this is a very big deal indeed,  and that it raises questions over the essence of its relationship with America, Australia  and, indeed, the UK - though it's noticeable that France is not recalling its ambassador to London. The explanation given in briefings to the French press,  with deliberate disdain,  is that France considers the UK a junior player in the new pact, seeking a new world role post-Brexit, and riding along on Uncle Sam's coat-tails. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. The announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines. China meanwhile accused the three powers involved in the pact of having a ""Cold War mentality"".

"Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of carbon dioxide that could hit meat production. Poultry producers said the shortage ""threatens national food security"". The gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process. The carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting production due to soaring natural gas prices. The government said it was monitoring the situation ""closely"". It has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat processors,as first reported by the Financial Times,external. Fertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. In the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated, there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas. This week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a number of its European plants. Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeeze Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the issue. ""This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,"" Mr Allen said. About 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said. ""With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure. ""If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput."" He said the industry group's members ""are on a knife-edge situation at the moment"". Meat processors are working with government to ""mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food"", he added. ""This is incredibly serious,"" one supermarket executive told the BBC. ""Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks."" Industry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday. Meat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit. Carbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life. It is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing. However, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said. It unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored. The remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant. Without carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said. The Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops. Gas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide ""which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry"", it said in an open letter. The ""extreme rise"" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added. A government spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.""

"The disease attacks the central nervous system of cattle and is usually fatal A case of the cattle disease BSE has been confirmed on a farm in Somerset. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said that the infected animal has died and has been removed. An investigation is under way to find the source of the infection and restrictions on the movement of cattle on the farm have been put in place. ""There is no risk to food safety or public health,"" said chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss. The single case of classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,commonly known as mad cow disease, was confirmed earlier today. ""We recognise this will be a traumatic time for the farmer and we are on hand to offer advice through this difficult period,"" said Ms Middlemiss. ""The UK's overall risk status for BSE remains at 'controlled',"" she added. APHA will now investigate the herd, premises and potential sources of infection. It said that there have been five confirmed cases of BSE in the UK since 2014 and all have been in animals which were not destined for the human food chain and posed no risk to the public.â¯ A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said there are ""strict controls in place"" to protect consumers from the risk of BSE.

"Manchester United has revealed that broadcasting revenues helped to soften the financial hit from the pandemic. In the 12 months to 30 June, the club made Â£254.8m from broadcasters, 81.7% up on the previous year's Â£140.2m. However, with games being played without fans due to Covid, matchday revenues fell from Â£89.8m to Â£7.1m. Ed Woodward said he was ""more confident than ever"" that the club was ""on the right track"" having signed the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo over the summer. Club legend Ronaldo returned to United after first departing in 2009. Man Utd will pay the striker's previous club Juventus an initial â¬15m (Â£12.8m) for his services, as part of a deal which could rise to â¬23m over five years. Mr Woodward, executive vice chairman, said the Ronaldo deal, along with the signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Tom Heaton, were ""made possible by the strength of our operating model, with sustained investment in the team underpinned by robust commercial revenues"". ""While the financial impact from the pandemic is visible, our continued underlying strength is also clear to see and everyone associated with the club can be proud of the resilience we have shown through these most testing of times,"" he said. ""These signings have demonstrated our continued ability to attract some of the world's best footballers to Old Trafford, and our firm commitment to helping Ole deliver success on the pitch."" In April, thousands of United supporters gathered outside Old Trafford to protest against the club's owners for their involvement in the short-lived European Super League (ESL). Protestors called for the Glazer family to leave the club, after United became one of the 12 founding members of the competition. Co-chairman Joel Glazer apologised and admitted the distant nature of the club's American ownership ""was not right"" when he spoke to 11 representatives on a virtual fans forum - the first time any representative of the family had engaged with supporters since the bought the club in 2005. Are Glazers making amends with Red Devils fans? Manchester United fans protest against Glazer family The club's total revenues for the year to June dropped from Â£509m to Â£494.1m. United reported a net loss of Â£92.2m for the period - up from Â£23.2m in 2020 -  which was largely down to the accounting impact of a Â£66.6m tax charge. Last year, United said it suffered a Â£70m drop in expected revenue, from Â£627.1m to Â£509m, as a direct result of the pandemic. Mr Woodward, will step down from his role at the end of 2021, said while Man Utd was ""confident"", it remained clear that ""football as a whole faces major financial challenges caused by years of material inflation in wages and transfer fees, exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic"". ""We are committed to working within the Premier League, the ECA and UEFA to promote greater financial sustainability at all levels of the game,"" he said. ""Global demand for live football is as strong as ever, as evidenced by the robust level of recent domestic and international broadcasting rights deals and record engagement with our own club content. ""But no club can succeed on its own. We want to be part of healthy, vibrant domestic and European football pyramids, working together with our governing bodies and, most importantly, the fans, to preserve and enhance the magic of our game.""

"Covid PCR testing should be abandoned for most holidaymakers, says travel organisation Abta. Fully vaccinated travellers should not need to be tested on their return from lower-risk countries, it said. It also called for a ""significant overhaul"" of the traffic light system for travel destinations. Abta said the policies had ""choked off"" this summer's travel trade, with seven out of 10 travel firms planning to make redundancies after furlough ends. It also called for the government to reduce the traffic light system to just a small number of ""red list"" countries, purely for the management of known Covid variants of concern. The expense of PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad. At present, going on holiday abroad means taking Covid tests when you are returning to the UK. Most private providers charge above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow devices. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. The next formal review of the government's travel policies is expected by 1 October, while the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September. What are the holiday rules for travel? Watchdog urges tougher line on Covid test firms With more than 80% of eligible UK adults already vaccinated against Covid, it was time for a ""stable framework"" for international travel, said Abta, which represents tour operators and travel agents. New summer foreign holiday bookings for 2021 were down 83% on 2019, Abta said, while almost half of travel companies reported they had seen no increase in 2021 bookings compared with last year, despite the rollout of the vaccine programme. The summer sun is fading, but the travel industry's fears are heating up as the end of furlough approaches. The industry is disappointed that vaccination didn't open up international travel as they would have hoped. The government said it will review the way international travel works before October and many expect it will come this week. Voices in the industry are hoping to make themselves heard before ministers meet to discuss exactly what might change. A sticking point could be PCR testing. The government has argued so far that it's needed for all travellers to catch variants of concern as early as possible, but the industry say these expensive tests are putting off travellers. Winter is approaching and travel companies need to make decisions about their future operations: they are waiting anxiously to see which way the government will go. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: ""The government's travel requirements have choked off this summer's travel trade - putting jobs, businesses and the UK's connectivity at risk. ""While our European neighbours have been travelling freely and safely, the British were subject to expensive measures which have stood in the way of people visiting family and friends, taking that much-needed foreign holiday and making important business connections. ""The government needs to wake up to the damage its policies are doing to the UK travel industry and the impact they will have on the wider economic recovery."" Abta urged the government to extend the furlough scheme for travel businesses alongside a package of tailored financial support for the industry. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Our top priority is to protect public health. Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors. ""We recognise the challenging times facing the travel sector, which is why we have committed around Â£7bn of support by September 2021 and continue to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period.""

"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure.

All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.

"Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of carbon dioxide that could hit meat production. Poultry producers said the shortage ""threatens national food security"". The gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process. The carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting production due to soaring natural gas prices. The government said it was monitoring the situation ""closely"". It has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat processors,as first reported by the Financial Times,external. Fertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. In the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated, there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas. This week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a number of its European plants. Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeeze Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the issue. ""This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,"" Mr Allen said. About 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said. ""With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure. ""If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput."" He said the industry group's members ""are on a knife-edge situation at the moment"". Meat processors are working with government to ""mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food"", he added. ""This is incredibly serious,"" one supermarket executive told the BBC. ""Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks."" Industry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday. Meat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit. Carbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life. It is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing. However, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said. It unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored. The remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant. Without carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said. The Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops. Gas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide ""which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry"", it said in an open letter. The ""extreme rise"" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added. A government spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.""

recap of thechanges to the rules on foreign travel to and from England, announced within the past hour by the UK transport secretary: Covid patient Marcus Birks died in hospital in August Away from the travel changes, a funeral service has been held for a Covid sceptic who later urged people to get vaccinated when he was hospitalised with the virus. Musician Marcus Birks, 40, from Leek, Staffordshire, died in August after being admitted to Royal Stoke University Hospital. After initially declining the vaccine, he had said he was ""shocked"" to have become so unwell. During the service, a tribute was read on behalf of his wife, Lis Birks. Lis, who was pregnant with Marcus's son when he died, described her husband as her soul mate. The tribute read: ""Since the day we met there has never been a dull moment in our lives together. ""His passion, dedication, drive and commitment took me on a whirlwind 17-year journey down a path I could only have dreamed of going down.""

The traffic light system of countries is being scrapped, and fully vaccinated people will have to take fewer tests after travelling to most countries. Take a look atwhat the rules currently are - and what they are changing to. In a Department for Transport statement released to coincide with the announcement, Grant Shapps says: âTodayâs changes

costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business
around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry."" He says that with ""more
than eight in 10 adults vaccinated in the UK, we are now
able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new
landscape"". The changes outlined by Grant Shapps for travellers arriving in England mean the current
traffic light system will be replaced by a single red list of countries and
territories - and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world
from 4 October. Before the new two-tiered system is introduced, eight additional countries and territories will
move off the red list. They are: This will take effect from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 22
September. You can read more on the changes here. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Over the summer scientists advising the governmentsaid the biggest threat to our health security,externalwas a coronavirus variant which could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. We've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases
of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. It started
spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the
virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it
was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital. Detecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated
travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they
arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to
genetically sequence the sample and find out
if the next potentially more dangerous variant had
arrived. We know that contracting Covid after two doses of a vaccine
is still possible, so double jabbed travellers could still bring new variants
into the UK. But critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples
that could be analysed in this way was very low â partly because a certain
level of virus was needed for the test to work properly.The latest figures suggest,externalthat between 12 August and 1 September only
about 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were
successfully sequenced. Under the new plans fully vaccinated
travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive,
lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home. LFTs cannot be sequenced
so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow-up PCR lab
test, which will be paid for by the NHS. But there is a worry that without regular,
automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through
the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tells reporters: ""We
wanted to bring a new simple, easier to navigate and cheaper system."" He says the changes will last ""into the new year at the very least"". The
purpose, he says, is to ""make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many
tests and with a greater level of certainty now that weâve got so many people
vaccinated"". Shapps says: ""Now
weâve got so many people vaccinated, perhaps nine out of 10 adults, it does
give us some additional freedoms. ""And one of those is that we can drop the
pre-departure tests. ""Another is that we can drop the expensive PCR tests on day
two when people got back from abroad. ""But
we will still require people to buy and use a lateral flow test."" From 4 October, people who are fully vaccinated will not need a pre-departure test before arrival into England from a non-red list country, says the transport secretary. And from later in October, those people will be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test. Grant Shapps also announces that eight countries and territories will come off the red list  from 04:00 BST on 22 September - they include Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives. The UK government is simplifying its travel traffic light system and testing rules for travellers, the transport secretary confirms. Grant Shapps says the government is ""introducing a new simplified system for international travel from Mon 4 Oct, replacing the current approach with a single red list  and simplified measures for the rest of the world - striking the right balance to manage the public health risk as No.1 priority"". Stay with us for more detail on what this means for holidaymakers in England. India administeredmore than 20 million Covid vaccine doses,externalin a day on Friday in a record-breaking effort to mark PM Narendra Modi's 71st birthday. The effort surpassed the country's previous daily record of more than 13 million doses on 27 August. India aims to vaccinate all eligible citizens by the end of 2021 but experts say the drive needs to pick up a consistent pace to meet the target. It has so far given more than 787 million doses of three approved jabs. More than half of India's eligible population - some 588 million people - have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to official data. But only about 20% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated since the beginning of the drive in January. Regional disparities also persist with larger and poorer states lagging behind smaller and richer ones. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths within 28 days of a positive test have increased by 5.1% from the previous week
(4 to 10 September), with 995 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 48. Cases have fallen 23.0% from the previous
week, with 206,332 recorded between 11 and 17 September, a
decrease of 61,548. Another 23,833 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 63,999 have had a second
vaccine dose now. That means 81.5% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 32,651 cases
of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And
there have been another 178 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the
previous 28 days. In anticipation of changes to foreign travel rules, independent holiday companies are calling for business grants through local authorities to help them recover from the pandemic. Gary Lewis, CEO of The Travel Network Group, which represents more than 1,200 members, says the anticipated simplification of
the traffic light system will be welcome news. ""However, these changes will come too late
for many businesses who have been severely impacted by a second summer season
decimated by Government restrictions and uncertainty over travel,"" he says. ""Businesses have faced extreme cash-flow problems and with the furlough
scheme coming to an end, travel business owners are now in an even more
difficult position than last September. âOur members are
reporting huge inconsistencies between local authorities offering discretionary
grants to businesses affected by the pandemic. He says the
government needs to urgently provide a dedicated Travel Business Grant through the local authorities and ensure consistency of approach from authority
to authority. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The astronauts returned to Earth today from their 90-day space mission You wouldnât think there would be much chance of catching Covid-19 in
space but Chinese space personnel have told media that three astronauts will
now have to quarantine for 14 days after spending 90 days in space. Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo left for space in June to
carry outvarious projects at the Tianhe moduleof Chinaâs space station. It was Chinaâs longest-crewed space mission and theyreturned to earth earlier today, touching down in the Gobi Desert in north Chinaâs Inner
Mongolia region. When asked by Chinaâs national broadcaster why they needed to
follow the same quarantine measures as arrivals from overseas, Huang Weifen, chief designer of Chinaâs manned space project, said: âItâs unlikely that
they got infected with some virus during their flight - but their immune system
might have changed. ""Quarantine isintended to keep them safe,externaland sound."" Given that it is standard practice in the Covid-era for Chinese
people to log their travel history digitally when they return from overseas, users of
Chinaâs Twitter-like Sina Weibo are highly amused thatâspaceâ will seemingly be added to this system,externalas a destination. Others are asking how theyâll find ""isolation"" after isolating
themselves from the entire human race for three months. And some are questioning why itâs necessary for them to quarantine at
all - although there are jokes online about the crew, with users saying they have simply been on a ""long
business trip"". We are awaiting an announcement from transport secretary Grant Shapps on changes to foreign travel rules - but who will they apply to? The new rules will only definitely apply to England, as governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own. But the devolved administrations have recently implemented rule changes for travel announced in Westminster so it's thought they could follow suit. We brought you the news of Christmas markets returning this year in Birmingham and Manchester but there is less festive news in another major English city. The Leeds German Christmas market won't go ahead in 2021 and the cancellation will harm city centre businesses, according to a group that represents the hospitality industry. The market's organisers in Frankfurt have cancelled it for the second year running, because of uncertainty around coronavirus restrictions. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, tells BBC Radio Leeds: ""It's really devastating to have it cancelled for a second year. ""Christmas markets are becoming destinations in their own right, and you see a huge influx of people. You get people coming from across the region and across the country, even, boosting sales and making additional purchases in shops, cafes, pubs, bars, as well as the hotels."" Leeds City Council says it is ""disappointing"" the market is not going ahead, but adds there will still be events and food stalls in the city's Millennium Square. The Welsh government is being accused of a U-turn after announcing vaccine passes will be needed for entry into nightclubs and large events from 11 October. The Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Mark Drakeford had previously been against the idea. The party's leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, says: ""This is another disappointing U-turn from Labour's first minister who told me in July he was against the idea of people having to show a Covid passport to enter a venue or event in Wales. ""Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications."" He also highlights the fact the scheme will be introduced two weeks after the peak in infections as shown in the government's own modelling, and describes the timing as ""questionable"". ""For many, even those who support such a restriction, this looks like another perfect example of Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay closing the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" he adds. Some 10,000 fans were able to watch Manchester United draw with Fulham at Old Trafford on 18 May The 2020-21 football season will go down as the one that clubs survived despite having virtually no fans coming through the turnstiles - and new figures from one of the biggest clubs of all show the effect. The latest annual report from Manchester United shows that it went from matchday revenues ofÂ£89.8mdown to justÂ£7.1m. But at the same time, the money that the club made from broadcasters showing the matches to fans in the UK and around the world jumped fromÂ£140.2mtoÂ£254.8m,wiping out that shortfall. In case you've forgotten the reason that there was any matchday income at all... it was because clubs were able to get fans in for a match in the final week of the season as restrictions started to relax. The Red Devils were able to invite 10,000 paying fans to watch them draw against Fulham on 18 May. Back to our main Covid story this afternoon. The transport secretary has said he will announce measures to simplify foreign travel - so what are we expecting him to say? There is speculation that ministers will agree that fully vaccinated arrivals will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test or a post-arrival PCR test. This would save travellers around Â£100 per trip. According to reports, they could be required to quarantine at home and take two tests when arriving from a low-risk location under the new system. The changes would come into force ahead of the October half-term break. It is expected that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for solo travellers. There are 62 countries on the list but it is expected to be reduced. Â© 2025 BBC.

"David Gomoh was stabbed at least nine times Four gang members have received life sentences for the murder of a ""charismatic and intelligent"" NHS worker who died in front of his family. David Gomoh, 24, staggered home after being stabbed while on the phone to his girlfriend in Canning Town, east London, in April 2020. He had no links to any gangs but was randomly targeted as part of a feud. His death was part of a ""petty but fatal game of one-upmanship"" played out on the streets, the Old Bailey heard. Muhammad Jalloh, 19, from Stratford, east London, and Vagnei Colubali, 23, from Cambridge, were jailed for a minimum of 27 years. David Ture, 19, of no fixed address, was given 26 years and Alex Melaku, 18, of Telford, 21 years. Melaku only became an adult one day before sentencing, meaning he has been identified for the first time. (L to R): Vagnei Colubali, David Ture, Mohammad Jalloh and Alex Melaku have been jailed for life All four defendants were also sentenced to concurrent terms for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to an unidentified man who escaped. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, the Recorder of London, said the killers had carried out a ""brutal murder"" which had involved a ""significant degree"" of planning. Mr Gomoh, a marketing graduate, who worked in procurement for the health service, had been in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"", he added. In a victim impact statement, his mother Marian said she was ""haunted"" by recurring nightmares about what happened, adding: ""I felt numb, paralysed by grief and pain. Why David?"" She said the ""psychological and emotional torture escalated"" during the trial, as she listened to details of what happened to her ""beautiful son"". She said her son's murderers had ""walked uninvited into our lives and destroyed David's life"". Mr Gomoh as a boy The defendants have ""wrecked our family"", she said, adding: ""Their contempt for a human life is just beyond comprehension."" His sister Lizzie paid tribute to her ""fun-loving, amazing brother"", adding that his death had had a ""devastating impact on us all"". She said: ""It still feels so raw and so fresh."" Referring to her brother's killers, she said: ""I hope they will eventually show remorse."" Det Ch Insp Laurence Smith described it as a ""senseless attack on a completely innocent man"". He said: ""Despite the significant evidence linking them to this crime, all four refused to admit to their actions, meaning David's family and friends had to sit through a trial and relive the worst night of their lives.""

"The Dorman Long tower was built in the 1950s to store coal An industrial tower is to be demolished after a last-minute conservation listing was quashed by the new culture secretary hours after her appointment. Plans to destroy the Dorman Long structure on the former Redcar steelworks site were revealed by Redcar and Cleveland Council a week ago. Historic England then advised it should begranted Grade II-listed status. Now, in one of her first acts in the role, Nadine Dorries has revoked this saying it did not ""merit"" listing. Nadine Dorries said the building was ""essentially a functional structure"" Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) and the Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen had lodged an appeal against the listed status, alongside the request to the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to intervene. Mr Houchen said: ""I would like to send a message to those that think trying to stop these developments is the right thing to do - our heritage does not lie in a rotting coal bunker, our heritage lies in the people that built this great region. ""It lies in the structures that stand tall across the world, from The Shard, Sydney Harbour Bridge and One World Trade Centre."" He later claimed that, if the Brutalist-style concrete tower had been allowed to remain, it ""would have cost the taxpayer in excess of Â£9m"". The South Tees Development Corporation, which has responsibility for developing the Teesworks site, said the 183ft (56m) tower would be demolished in the early hours of Sunday. The coal bunker, which was built in the 1950s and could store 5,000 tonnes of fuel, will be razed along with other buildings on the site in a series of controlled explosions between 00:00 and 02:00 BST. There are major plans to regenerate the former SSI site Campaigners against the destruction had argued the tower was a monument to Teesside's industrial past. TV architect George Clarkesaid,externalit was ""heart-breaking news"", adding: ""We've lost way too many buildings in the North East that celebrate our incredible industrial past."" He said it was a ""unique building and should be saved"". Workers were on site on Friday morning, priming the concrete bunker for demolition Labour's former candidate to be Tees Valley mayor, Jessie Joe Jacobs,accused Ms Dorries of ""cultural vandalism"",external. ""The Dorman Long tower is one of UK's best examples of brutalist architecture and a proud symbol of Teesside's industrial heritage. This is just tragic,"" she wrote. However, correspondence seen by theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceshowed the culture secretary had judged the building ""not of sufficient architectural or historic interest to merit listing"".Â She ruled that the loss of fabric from the building reduced its architectural interest and made it ""essentially a functional structure"".Â A worker walks past the tower in 1956 The tower sits near the South Bank coke oven battery on the former Redcar SSI steelworks site,which closed in 2015with the loss of thousands of jobs. The ovens will now make way for a new wind turbine manufacturing facility being built by LM Wind, a subsidiary of GE renewable energy. A statement from Historic England said: ""We recognise the importance of the public benefits that will come from the remediation and planned regeneration of the whole Teesworks site.Â ""We also accept, with regret, that demolition of the tower is now likely to proceed but we are keen to continue supporting local partners as works progress.""

"The government is pausing its controversial planning reforms in England amid an angry backlash from Conservative MPs, government sources have told the BBC. Michael Gove - who was given the role of housing secretary on Wednesday - is said to want to address MPs' concerns. The government has pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year. And ministers had insisted the planning rules needed a radical shake-up to ensure more homes could be delivered. Under their proposals, the current system - where local planning officials assess applications case-by-case - would be replaced with new rules based on zones. Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Is levelling up about to get the Gove treatment? Councils in England would have to classify all land in their area as ""protected"", for ""renewal"", or for ""growth"". In protected areas, including areas of natural beauty, places at risk of flooding, and the green belt, development would generally remain restricted. But councils would have to look favourably on development in ""renewal"" areas, whilst in ""growth"" zones, applications conforming to pre-agreed local plans would automatically gain initial approval. Local residents would get a say on new 10-year plans underpinning the zones, but their ability to comment on individual applications would be curtailed. Councils would have to plan for a share of homes from the government's 300,000 annual house building target for England. Politicians have generally agreed on the need for more affordable homes in England. In 2020 research conducted bythe BBC found thatthe difference between the current housing stock and the number needed for everyone to have a decent home to live in is more than one million homes However, the plans had been met by resistance from the government's own MPs as well as the opposition. In a Commons debate last year, former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May described the proposals as ""ill-conceived"" and warned that it would ""build up planning permissions, but not houses"". Earlier this year, the Conservativeslost their previously safe seat of Chesham and Amersham,in part due to local concerns over increased house building. Labour's shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said the reforms should be ""scrapped altogether"" adding that they risked ""selling out communities and gagging residents from having a say over development in their area"". Another Conservative MP, Bob Seely, who had been highly critical of the changes welcomed the pause. He told the BBC he and other MPs would be meeting Mr Gove next week. He said change was needed but expressed concern that the current proposals would give ""too much power to developers"". Theresa May has been a prominent critic of the government's planning proposals Another critic, Conservative Sir Roger Gale, said: ""The zoning concept has got to go and I want a clear undertaking that there will be presumption that top quality agricultural land will not be developed on."" Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Gemma Burgess, a Cambridge University housing expert, said the pause would ""create a period of uncertainty"" and developers and house builders were likely to get ""nervous"" because ""we don't know what's coming next"". Andrew Whitaker, of The Home Builders Federation, said the ""very inefficient"" current system needed reform because it allowed people too many ""bites of the cherry"" when it came to objecting developments. He added that there were ""too many local authorities, particularly in the south-east of Englandâ¦ who don't care about delivering the number of houses that they need in their local area"". The appointment of Mr Gove to the housing department, has been met with apprehension in some quarters, given his reputation as a radical reformer. One Conservative MP told the BBC: ""We can't tell whether he's been appointed to build any and everywhere regardless of the opposition, or whether he's been appointed to deliver some sort of compromise."" A Labour councillor expressed concern Mr Gove would override any opposition to changes, adding ""the fear is he'll fly in, make his mark, and fly out like he did in education"" - a reference to his school reforms and battles with the teachers' unions. Meanwhile, Mr Gove has faced calls to return Â£100,000 in donations from a property developer on 6 August to avoid any conflict of interest. Parliamentary records show that he received two donations of Â£50,000 each from Zachariasz Gertler, a British/German developer. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The Tories are much more interested in taking developers' cash than they are in building affordable and social housing."" A spokesperson for the Housing, Communities and Local Government said all donations made to Mr Gove ""have been declared publicly and the proper process followed"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia. The deal - seen as an effort to counter China - will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. But the move angered France, which said it had been ""stabbed in the back"", while China accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war. The alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. While they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing's influence in the contested South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea Mr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China. But the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China. She asked the prime minister about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Mr Johnson replied: ""The United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing."" Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Meanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a ""stab in the back"". He called it a ""brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision"" that reminded him of former US President Donald Trump. French diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation. This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? ""It's a very low moment,"" France's former ambassador to the US, GÃ©rard Araud, told the BBC's World Tonight programme. ""The US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn't care."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France ""a vital partner"" and said Washington would still work ""incredibly closely"" with Paris. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms. ""There are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don't, and they have partnerships with other countries that don't include us,"" she said. ""That is part of how global diplomacy works."" The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Mr Lovegrove said the pact was ""perhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades"". China, meanwhile,has accused the allies of having a ""Cold War mentality""that would hurt their own interests. The Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the ""first to die"" in a Chinese ""counterattack"". And on Friday, China's President Xi Jinping said foreign powers should not be allowed to interfere in the country's affairs. ""The future of our country's development and progress should lie firmly in our own hands,"" he said, according to state media. But Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing's reaction. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' ""This is not the first time that we've seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia's position,"" he said. ""We are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That's the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts."" Meanwhile,China applied to join a key Asia-Pacific trade pacton Thursday as it attempts to strengthen its position in the region. The country's foreign ministry, however, denied that the move to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was a response to the UK-US-Australia pact. Joining the CPTPP, which was signed in 2018 by 11 countries including Australia and Japan, would mark a significant boost to China's trading power.

"The murder of Sarah Everard in March prompted a public debate about women's safety Tackling violence against women and girls should be as much of a priority as countering terrorism, a police watchdog has said. It has identified major inconsistencies between police forces in how they tackle the issue. A report was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year. Police say they need more investment to help bring offenders more quickly to justice. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called for ""fundamental cross-system change"" after identifying continuing failings. Three-quarters of domestic abuse cases are closed early without the suspect being charged, its report said. Top police role to tackle violence against women How many attacks on woman are reported to police? West Midlands Police apologises for failing domestic abuse victim According to official statistics, in the year ending March 2020 there were: An estimated 1.6 million female victims of domestic abuse in England and Wales 618,000 female victims of sexual assault 892,000 female victims of stalking The HMICFRS said that the police have made ""vast improvements"" over a decade in dealing with this ""epidemic"" of violence - but there were still staggering variations between police forces. It said a police power which allows officers to tell women that a partner has a history of abuse, known as Clare's Law, was used so differently by individual forces it amounted to a postcode lottery. And too often, said the inspectors, police were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. That response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. These major crimes, said inspectors, were treated as national priorities, benefiting from a ""clearer focus, better funding and relentless pursuit"" of offenders. One woman, whose identity we are protecting, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the ""restrictive and aggressive"" domestic abuse she faced. ""I was very frightened, and had all my civil liberties curbed - where I went, what I did, who I met with, how I spent my money. ""I was very much in fear about what the next step what be."" On the occasions she did call the police, she says it was out of concern for her abuser - who made her feel ""responsible"" for his ""bad moods and angry outbursts"". Police did not understand that this ""was the nature of the abusive relationship"" she says, and officers initially treated the case as mental health-related. She says her abuser threatened to burn the house down and to kill himself, before physically assaulting her. He was arrested, but then released without charge, she explains, adding that a police officer told her that it was a matter of ""he-said-she-said"" and that there was ""no substantial evidence"". It takes a ""huge amount of courage"" to report abuse, she says, and ""the point when someone is released without charge really signifies to the victim that it's not worth ringing the police because they won't do anything."" Environment Secretary George Eustice said police forces must ""learn"" from each other to improve their approach to dealing with violence against women. He told Sky News: ""Obviously Priti Patel will now look at these recommendations but I think this report does highlight some differences between police forces. ""What we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well - and I think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others - and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country."" Sarah Everard was snatched by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on 3 March, and was then raped and strangled. The firearms officer has sincepleaded guilty to the 33-year-old's murder. Police were criticised for their handling of a vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard in March this year Zoe Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had ""vastly improved"" their response to tackling violence against women and girls in the last seven years. But she warned we would not be able to ""police our way out of the the breadth and depth of crimes being inflicted on women, day in, day out"". There needs to be an ""uplift in the prioritisation"" of violence against women and girls, with a ""bold and radical whole system approach"", she added. She said that councils, courts, teachers and the NHS - among others - should be expected to treat violence against women and girls ""as their business"" and work together to prevent it. When HMICFRS carried out fieldwork with four forces - Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Surrey and Humberside - it asked them to each identify 10 serious local offenders who posed an ongoing risk to women. Of the 40 individuals identified, 34 had not actually been flagged within the force's intelligence systems as being prolifically dangerous individuals. Labour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, urged the government to enact the report's recommendations and ensure it doesn't just ""gather dust on the shelf"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need the government to implement this report, to actually put in place the structures that this report proposes, and give it the prioritisation and we also need them to ensure that the resources are there."" Refuge, a charity providing support for women and children experiencing domestic violence, said for too long there had been a failure to implement recommendations that would improve how violence against women and girls (VAWG) is tackled. Ruth Davison, Refuge's chief executive, said: ""This must change. The report rightly calls for 'radical action' and we hope that the home secretary, who has commissioned this report, will look at the recommendations carefully and respond accordingly."" Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council leader on violence, said the report set out a ""clear way forward"" for change and that there was ""no lack of commitment"" for this work. She insisted that forces were recognising violence against women and girls as a ""significant priority"", adding that chief constables were signing up to a national violence against women and girls strategy and a co-ordinator would be employed to to ensure the report's recommendations were implemented. Responding to the report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said tackling violence against women and girls was a top priority for the government. She said: ""Our VAWG Strategy, which commits to radically changing how we end abuse using a whole system approach, focuses on working with key agencies including police, healthcare and education. ""We have already taken essential action including introducing a national police lead for tackling VAWG and making Relationship Education compulsory in all primary schools."" The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said the way police responded to violence against and girls had improved in recent years, but consistency and improvements were still needed. Sophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime and joint victims' lead for the APCC, added: ""The numbers of cases closed without a suspect being charged - either because of evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support a prosecution - shows that too many victims are still being let down.""

"The Dorman Long tower was built in the 1950s to store coal An industrial tower is to be demolished after a last-minute conservation listing was quashed by the new culture secretary hours after her appointment. Plans to destroy the Dorman Long structure on the former Redcar steelworks site were revealed by Redcar and Cleveland Council a week ago. Historic England then advised it should begranted Grade II-listed status. Now, in one of her first acts in the role, Nadine Dorries has revoked this saying it did not ""merit"" listing. Nadine Dorries said the building was ""essentially a functional structure"" Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) and the Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen had lodged an appeal against the listed status, alongside the request to the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to intervene. Mr Houchen said: ""I would like to send a message to those that think trying to stop these developments is the right thing to do - our heritage does not lie in a rotting coal bunker, our heritage lies in the people that built this great region. ""It lies in the structures that stand tall across the world, from The Shard, Sydney Harbour Bridge and One World Trade Centre."" He later claimed that, if the Brutalist-style concrete tower had been allowed to remain, it ""would have cost the taxpayer in excess of Â£9m"". The South Tees Development Corporation, which has responsibility for developing the Teesworks site, said the 183ft (56m) tower would be demolished in the early hours of Sunday. The coal bunker, which was built in the 1950s and could store 5,000 tonnes of fuel, will be razed along with other buildings on the site in a series of controlled explosions between 00:00 and 02:00 BST. There are major plans to regenerate the former SSI site Campaigners against the destruction had argued the tower was a monument to Teesside's industrial past. TV architect George Clarkesaid,externalit was ""heart-breaking news"", adding: ""We've lost way too many buildings in the North East that celebrate our incredible industrial past."" He said it was a ""unique building and should be saved"". Workers were on site on Friday morning, priming the concrete bunker for demolition Labour's former candidate to be Tees Valley mayor, Jessie Joe Jacobs,accused Ms Dorries of ""cultural vandalism"",external. ""The Dorman Long tower is one of UK's best examples of brutalist architecture and a proud symbol of Teesside's industrial heritage. This is just tragic,"" she wrote. However, correspondence seen by theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceshowed the culture secretary had judged the building ""not of sufficient architectural or historic interest to merit listing"".Â She ruled that the loss of fabric from the building reduced its architectural interest and made it ""essentially a functional structure"".Â A worker walks past the tower in 1956 The tower sits near the South Bank coke oven battery on the former Redcar SSI steelworks site,which closed in 2015with the loss of thousands of jobs. The ovens will now make way for a new wind turbine manufacturing facility being built by LM Wind, a subsidiary of GE renewable energy. A statement from Historic England said: ""We recognise the importance of the public benefits that will come from the remediation and planned regeneration of the whole Teesworks site.Â ""We also accept, with regret, that demolition of the tower is now likely to proceed but we are keen to continue supporting local partners as works progress.""

"Keira Bell (centre) said she should have been challenged more when she decided to transition to male Doctors can judge if under-16s can give informed consent to puberty blocker use,the Court of Appeal has ruled.,external The appeal was brought by the Tavistock Trust, which runs the UK's only youth gender identity clinic. The decision reverses a 2020 ruling that under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment, which delays the onset of puberty. The original case was brought by Keira Bell, who says the clinic should have challenged her more over transitioning. She said she was disappointed by the decision, and will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. Court of Appeal judges said they recognised ""the difficulties and complexities"" of the issue, but that ""it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgement knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances"". Puberty blockers are drugs used to ""pause"" puberty by suppressing the release of hormones. They are prescribed to some children who are experiencing gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as ""a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"". Ms Bell says she will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court The Tavistock clinic said it welcomed the decision. ""The judgement upholds established legal principles which respect the ability of our clinicians to engage actively and thoughtfully with our patients in decisions about their care and futures,"" a spokesperson said. ""It affirms that it is for doctors, not judges, to decide on the capacity of under-16s to consent to medical treatment."" What are puberty blockers? What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) said that hormone treatment ""allows a young person time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment"". In December 2020, the High Court ruled under-13s were ""highly unlikely"" to be able to give informed consent to what it described as ""experimental"" treatment and it was ""very doubtful"" those aged 14 and 15 would have the sufficient understanding of the implications. Keira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to Gids. She was later prescribed the male hormone testosterone and had surgery to remove her breasts. Now in her mid-20s, she regrets the decision to transition to a male, and feels there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage. She said she had ""no regrets"" about bringing the case, which she said ""shone a light into the dark corners of a medical scandal that is harming children and harmed me. ""I am obviously disappointed with the ruling of the court today, and especially that it did not grapple with the significant risk of harm that children are exposed to by being given powerful experimental drugs."" This a complex, controversial area, yet the Court of Appeal's ruling is very clear. It is for doctors working with families and the children themselves to decide whether that young person can truly understand the implications of taking drugs that could change the course of their life. Effectively this ruling has removed the courts from the decision-making process in all but the most difficult cases. This will be welcomed by many young people struggling with their gender identity, who believe the long wait for treatment that they already face is causing huge distress and harm. But for those like Keira Bell, who believe they weren't challenged enough when they made decisions that shaped their futures, there will be real disappointment. However, the court cases have led to more discussion of the issues - and many will hope that they will also lead to greater understanding. In March, a separate judgement from the court's Family Division had ruled parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers, with other safeguarding measures considered. The Tavistock temporarily paused new referrals to its endocrinology service following the rulings. Eligible under-16s who had already been referred for treatment, and have parental consent, are having their cases reviewed by Gids, with decisions overseen by an independent NHS England review group. The NHS said the findings ofDr Hilary Cass's independent review,externalinto NHS gender identity services for children and young people would shed further light on the issue. The review was announced in September 2020, when it was said it would take ""12 months or possibly longer"". ""The NHS commissioned Dr Hilary Cass to review gender identity services prior to the original High Court ruling to ensure the best model of safe and effective care is delivered - this will set out wide-ranging recommendations including on the use of puberty blockers and the many contested clinical issues identified by the court,"" a spokesperson said. ""An independent multi-professional review group will continue to confirm whether clinical decision making has followed a robust consent process now that the endocrine pathway has been reopened by the Tavistock.""

The decision reverses a 2020 ruling that under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment, which delays the onset of puberty. The original case was brought by Keira Bell, who says the clinic should have challenged her more over transitioning. She said she was disappointed by the decision, and will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. Court of Appeal judges said they recognised ""the difficulties and complexities"" of the issue, but that ""it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgement knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances"". Puberty blockers are drugs used to ""pause"" puberty by suppressing the release of hormones. They are prescribed to some children who are experiencing gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as ""a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"". Ms Bell says she will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court The Tavistock clinic said it welcomed the decision. ""The judgement upholds established legal principles which respect the ability of our clinicians to engage actively and thoughtfully with our patients in decisions about their care and futures,"" a spokesperson said. ""It affirms that it is for doctors, not judges, to decide on the capacity of under-16s to consent to medical treatment."" What are puberty blockers? What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) said that hormone treatment ""allows a young person time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment"". In December 2020, the High Court ruled under-13s were ""highly unlikely"" to be able to give informed consent to what it described as ""experimental"" treatment and it was ""very doubtful"" those aged 14 and 15 would have the sufficient understanding of the implications. Keira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to Gids. She was later prescribed the male hormone testosterone and had surgery to remove her breasts. Now in her mid-20s, she regrets the decision to transition to a male, and feels there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage. She said she had ""no regrets"" about bringing the case, which she said ""shone a light into the dark corners of a medical scandal that is harming children and harmed me. ""I am obviously disappointed with the ruling of the court today, and especially that it did not grapple with the significant risk of harm that children are exposed to by being given powerful experimental drugs."" This a complex, controversial area, yet the Court of Appeal's ruling is very clear. It is for doctors working with families and the children themselves to decide whether that young person can truly understand the implications of taking drugs that could change the course of their life. Effectively this ruling has removed the courts from the decision-making process in all but the most difficult cases. This will be welcomed by many young people struggling with their gender identity, who believe the long wait for treatment that they already face is causing huge distress and harm. But for those like Keira Bell, who believe they weren't challenged enough when they made decisions that shaped their futures, there will be real disappointment. However, the court cases have led to more discussion of the issues - and many will hope that they will also lead to greater understanding. In March, a separate judgement from the court's Family Division had ruled parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers, with other safeguarding measures considered. The Tavistock temporarily paused new referrals to its endocrinology service following the rulings. Eligible under-16s who had already been referred for treatment, and have parental consent, are having their cases reviewed by Gids, with decisions overseen by an independent NHS England review group. The NHS said the findings ofDr Hilary Cass's independent review,externalinto NHS gender identity services for children and young people would shed further light on the issue. The review was announced in September 2020, when it was said it would take ""12 months or possibly longer"". ""The NHS commissioned Dr Hilary Cass to review gender identity services prior to the original High Court ruling to ensure the best model of safe and effective care is delivered - this will set out wide-ranging recommendations including on the use of puberty blockers and the many contested clinical issues identified by the court,"" a spokesperson said. ""An independent multi-professional review group will continue to confirm whether clinical decision making has followed a robust consent process now that the endocrine pathway has been reopened by the Tavistock.""

"Manchester United has revealed that broadcasting revenues helped to soften the financial hit from the pandemic. In the 12 months to 30 June, the club made Â£254.8m from broadcasters, 81.7% up on the previous year's Â£140.2m. However, with games being played without fans due to Covid, matchday revenues fell from Â£89.8m to Â£7.1m. Ed Woodward said he was ""more confident than ever"" that the club was ""on the right track"" having signed the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo over the summer. Club legend Ronaldo returned to United after first departing in 2009. Man Utd will pay the striker's previous club Juventus an initial â¬15m (Â£12.8m) for his services, as part of a deal which could rise to â¬23m over five years. Mr Woodward, executive vice chairman, said the Ronaldo deal, along with the signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Tom Heaton, were ""made possible by the strength of our operating model, with sustained investment in the team underpinned by robust commercial revenues"". ""While the financial impact from the pandemic is visible, our continued underlying strength is also clear to see and everyone associated with the club can be proud of the resilience we have shown through these most testing of times,"" he said. ""These signings have demonstrated our continued ability to attract some of the world's best footballers to Old Trafford, and our firm commitment to helping Ole deliver success on the pitch."" In April, thousands of United supporters gathered outside Old Trafford to protest against the club's owners for their involvement in the short-lived European Super League (ESL). Protestors called for the Glazer family to leave the club, after United became one of the 12 founding members of the competition. Co-chairman Joel Glazer apologised and admitted the distant nature of the club's American ownership ""was not right"" when he spoke to 11 representatives on a virtual fans forum - the first time any representative of the family had engaged with supporters since the bought the club in 2005. Are Glazers making amends with Red Devils fans? Manchester United fans protest against Glazer family The club's total revenues for the year to June dropped from Â£509m to Â£494.1m. United reported a net loss of Â£92.2m for the period - up from Â£23.2m in 2020 -  which was largely down to the accounting impact of a Â£66.6m tax charge. Last year, United said it suffered a Â£70m drop in expected revenue, from Â£627.1m to Â£509m, as a direct result of the pandemic. Mr Woodward, will step down from his role at the end of 2021, said while Man Utd was ""confident"", it remained clear that ""football as a whole faces major financial challenges caused by years of material inflation in wages and transfer fees, exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic"". ""We are committed to working within the Premier League, the ECA and UEFA to promote greater financial sustainability at all levels of the game,"" he said. ""Global demand for live football is as strong as ever, as evidenced by the robust level of recent domestic and international broadcasting rights deals and record engagement with our own club content. ""But no club can succeed on its own. We want to be part of healthy, vibrant domestic and European football pyramids, working together with our governing bodies and, most importantly, the fans, to preserve and enhance the magic of our game.""

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlines changes to rules around international travel The traffic list system is being simplified to just highlight red list countries, Shapps says Fully vaccinated people returning to England from non-red list countries will no longer need to take PCR tests from 4 October And eight countries are coming off the red list including Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives A further 32,651 coronavirus cases are recorded in the UK and 178 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test People will need a vaccine passport to enter nightclubs and attend large events in Wales from next month, First Minister Mark Drakeford announces Italy is to make it compulsory for all workers to have proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the virus A civil court case begins against the Austrian government over alleged mishandling of an outbreak at the ski resort of Ischgl in March 2020 Edited by James Clarke Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for

recap of thechanges to the rules on foreign travel to and from England, announced within the past hour by the UK transport secretary: Covid patient Marcus Birks died in hospital in August Away from the travel changes, a funeral service has been held for a Covid sceptic who later urged people to get vaccinated when he was hospitalised with the virus. Musician Marcus Birks, 40, from Leek, Staffordshire, died in August after being admitted to Royal Stoke University Hospital. After initially declining the vaccine, he had said he was ""shocked"" to have become so unwell. During the service, a tribute was read on behalf of his wife, Lis Birks. Lis, who was pregnant with Marcus's son when he died, described her husband as her soul mate. The tribute read: ""Since the day we met there has never been a dull moment in our lives together.

Read more As the transport secretary unveils a new two-tier system for international travellers to the UK, the rules are changing. The traffic light system of countries is being scrapped, and fully vaccinated people will have to take fewer tests after travelling to most countries. Take a look atwhat the rules currently are - and what they are changing to. In a Department for Transport statement released to coincide with the announcement, Grant Shapps says: âTodayâs changes
mean a simpler, more straightforward system. ""One with less testing and lower
costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business
around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry."" He says that with ""more
than eight in 10 adults vaccinated in the UK, we are now
able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new
landscape"". The changes outlined by Grant Shapps for travellers arriving in England mean the current
traffic light system will be replaced by a single red list of countries and
territories - and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world
from 4 October. Before the new two-tiered system is introduced, eight additional countries and territories will
move off the red list. They are: This will take effect from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 22

Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Over the summer scientists advising the governmentsaid the biggest threat to our health security,externalwas a coronavirus variant which could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. We've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases
of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. It started
spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the
virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it
was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital. Detecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated
travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they
arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to
genetically sequence the sample and find out
if the next potentially more dangerous variant had
arrived. We know that contracting Covid after two doses of a vaccine
is still possible, so double jabbed travellers could still bring new variants
into the UK. But critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples
that could be analysed in this way was very low â partly because a certain
level of virus was needed for the test to work properly.The latest figures suggest,externalthat between 12 August and 1 September only
about 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were
successfully sequenced. Under the new plans fully vaccinated
travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive,
lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home. LFTs cannot be sequenced
so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow-up PCR lab
test, which will be paid for by the NHS. But there is a worry that without regular,
automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through
the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tells reporters: ""We
wanted to bring a new simple, easier to navigate and cheaper system."" He says the changes will last ""into the new year at the very least"". The
purpose, he says, is to ""make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many
tests and with a greater level of certainty now that weâve got so many people
vaccinated"". Shapps says: ""Now
weâve got so many people vaccinated, perhaps nine out of 10 adults, it does
give us some additional freedoms. ""And one of those is that we can drop the
pre-departure tests. ""Another is that we can drop the expensive PCR tests on day
two when people got back from abroad. ""But
we will still require people to buy and use a lateral flow test."" From 4 October, people who are fully vaccinated will not need a pre-departure test before arrival into England from a non-red list country, says the transport secretary. And from later in October, those people will be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test. Grant Shapps also announces that eight countries and territories will come off the red list  from 04:00 BST on 22 September - they include Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives. The UK government is simplifying its travel traffic light system and testing rules for travellers, the transport secretary confirms. Grant Shapps says the government is ""introducing a new simplified system for international travel from Mon 4 Oct, replacing the current approach with a single red list  and simplified measures for the rest of the world - striking the right balance to manage the public health risk as No.1 priority"". Stay with us for more detail on what this means for holidaymakers in England. India administeredmore than 20 million Covid vaccine doses,externalin a day on Friday in a record-breaking effort to mark PM Narendra Modi's 71st birthday. The effort surpassed the country's previous daily record of more than 13 million doses on 27 August. India aims to vaccinate all eligible citizens by the end of 2021 but experts say the drive needs to pick up a consistent pace to meet the target. It has so far given more than 787 million doses of three approved jabs. More than half of India's eligible population - some 588 million people - have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to official data. But only about 20% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated since the beginning of the drive in January. Regional disparities also persist with larger and poorer states lagging behind smaller and richer ones. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths within 28 days of a positive test have increased by 5.1% from the previous week
(4 to 10 September), with 995 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 48. Cases have fallen 23.0% from the previous
week, with 206,332 recorded between 11 and 17 September, a
decrease of 61,548. Another 23,833 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 63,999 have had a second
vaccine dose now. That means 81.5% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 32,651 cases
of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And
there have been another 178 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the
previous 28 days. In anticipation of changes to foreign travel rules, independent holiday companies are calling for business grants through local authorities to help them recover from the pandemic. Gary Lewis, CEO of The Travel Network Group, which represents more than 1,200 members, says the anticipated simplification of
the traffic light system will be welcome news. ""However, these changes will come too late
for many businesses who have been severely impacted by a second summer season
decimated by Government restrictions and uncertainty over travel,"" he says. ""Businesses have faced extreme cash-flow problems and with the furlough
scheme coming to an end, travel business owners are now in an even more
difficult position than last September. âOur members are
reporting huge inconsistencies between local authorities offering discretionary
grants to businesses affected by the pandemic. He says the
government needs to urgently provide a dedicated Travel Business Grant through the local authorities and ensure consistency of approach from authority
to authority. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The astronauts returned to Earth today from their 90-day space mission You wouldnât think there would be much chance of catching Covid-19 in
space but Chinese space personnel have told media that three astronauts will
now have to quarantine for 14 days after spending 90 days in space. Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo left for space in June to
carry outvarious projects at the Tianhe moduleof Chinaâs space station. It was Chinaâs longest-crewed space mission and theyreturned to earth earlier today, touching down in the Gobi Desert in north Chinaâs Inner
Mongolia region. When asked by Chinaâs national broadcaster why they needed to
follow the same quarantine measures as arrivals from overseas, Huang Weifen, chief designer of Chinaâs manned space project, said: âItâs unlikely that
they got infected with some virus during their flight - but their immune system
might have changed. ""Quarantine isintended to keep them safe,externaland sound."" Given that it is standard practice in the Covid-era for Chinese
people to log their travel history digitally when they return from overseas, users of
Chinaâs Twitter-like Sina Weibo are highly amused thatâspaceâ will seemingly be added to this system,externalas a destination. Others are asking how theyâll find ""isolation"" after isolating
themselves from the entire human race for three months. And some are questioning why itâs necessary for them to quarantine at
all - although there are jokes online about the crew, with users saying they have simply been on a ""long
business trip"". We are awaiting an announcement from transport secretary Grant Shapps on changes to foreign travel rules - but who will they apply to? The new rules will only definitely apply to England, as governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own. But the devolved administrations have recently implemented rule changes for travel announced in Westminster so it's thought they could follow suit. We brought you the news of Christmas markets returning this year in Birmingham and Manchester but there is less festive news in another major English city. The Leeds German Christmas market won't go ahead in 2021 and the cancellation will harm city centre businesses, according to a group that represents the hospitality industry. The market's organisers in Frankfurt have cancelled it for the second year running, because of uncertainty around coronavirus restrictions. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, tells BBC Radio Leeds: ""It's really devastating to have it cancelled for a second year. ""Christmas markets are becoming destinations in their own right, and you see a huge influx of people. You get people coming from across the region and across the country, even, boosting sales and making additional purchases in shops, cafes, pubs, bars, as well as the hotels."" Leeds City Council says it is ""disappointing"" the market is not going ahead, but adds there will still be events and food stalls in the city's Millennium Square. The Welsh government is being accused of a U-turn after announcing vaccine passes will be needed for entry into nightclubs and large events from 11 October. The Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Mark Drakeford had previously been against the idea. The party's leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, says: ""This is another disappointing U-turn from Labour's first minister who told me in July he was against the idea of people having to show a Covid passport to enter a venue or event in Wales. ""Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications."" He also highlights the fact the scheme will be introduced two weeks after the peak in infections as shown in the government's own modelling, and describes the timing as ""questionable"". ""For many, even those who support such a restriction, this looks like another perfect example of Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay closing the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" he adds. Some 10,000 fans were able to watch Manchester United draw with Fulham at Old Trafford on 18 May The 2020-21 football season will go down as the one that clubs survived despite having virtually no fans coming through the turnstiles - and new figures from one of the biggest clubs of all show the effect. The latest annual report from Manchester United shows that it went from matchday revenues ofÂ£89.8mdown to justÂ£7.1m. But at the same time, the money that the club made from broadcasters showing the matches to fans in the UK and around the world jumped fromÂ£140.2mtoÂ£254.8m,wiping out that shortfall. In case you've forgotten the reason that there was any matchday income at all... it was because clubs were able to get fans in for a match in the final week of the season as restrictions started to relax. The Red Devils were able to invite 10,000 paying fans to watch them draw against Fulham on 18 May. Back to our main Covid story this afternoon. The transport secretary has said he will announce measures to simplify foreign travel - so what are we expecting him to say? There is speculation that ministers will agree that fully vaccinated arrivals will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test or a post-arrival PCR test. This would save travellers around Â£100 per trip. According to reports, they could be required to quarantine at home and take two tests when arriving from a low-risk location under the new system. The changes would come into force ahead of the October half-term break. It is expected that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for solo travellers. There are 62 countries on the list but it is expected to be reduced. Â© 2025 BBC.

week, with 206,332 recorded between 11 and 17 September, a
decrease of 61,548. Another 23,833 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 63,999 have had a second
vaccine dose now. That means 81.5% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 32,651 cases
of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And
there have been another 178 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the
previous 28 days. In anticipation of changes to foreign travel rules, independent holiday companies are calling for business grants through local authorities to help them recover from the pandemic. Gary Lewis, CEO of The Travel Network Group, which represents more than 1,200 members, says the anticipated simplification of
the traffic light system will be welcome news. ""However, these changes will come too late
for many businesses who have been severely impacted by a second summer season
decimated by Government restrictions and uncertainty over travel,"" he says. ""Businesses have faced extreme cash-flow problems and with the furlough
scheme coming to an end, travel business owners are now in an even more
difficult position than last September. âOur members are
reporting huge inconsistencies between local authorities offering discretionary
grants to businesses affected by the pandemic. He says the
government needs to urgently provide a dedicated Travel Business Grant through the local authorities and ensure consistency of approach from authority
to authority. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The astronauts returned to Earth today from their 90-day space mission You wouldnât think there would be much chance of catching Covid-19 in
space but Chinese space personnel have told media that three astronauts will
now have to quarantine for 14 days after spending 90 days in space. Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo left for space in June to
carry outvarious projects at the Tianhe moduleof Chinaâs space station. It was Chinaâs longest-crewed space mission and theyreturned to earth earlier today, touching down in the Gobi Desert in north Chinaâs Inner
Mongolia region. When asked by Chinaâs national broadcaster why they needed to
follow the same quarantine measures as arrivals from overseas, Huang Weifen, chief designer of Chinaâs manned space project, said: âItâs unlikely that
they got infected with some virus during their flight - but their immune system
might have changed. ""Quarantine isintended to keep them safe,externaland sound."" Given that it is standard practice in the Covid-era for Chinese
people to log their travel history digitally when they return from overseas, users of
Chinaâs Twitter-like Sina Weibo are highly amused thatâspaceâ will seemingly be added to this system,externalas a destination. Others are asking how theyâll find ""isolation"" after isolating
themselves from the entire human race for three months. And some are questioning why itâs necessary for them to quarantine at
all - although there are jokes online about the crew, with users saying they have simply been on a ""long
business trip"". We are awaiting an announcement from transport secretary Grant Shapps on changes to foreign travel rules - but who will they apply to? The new rules will only definitely apply to England, as governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own. But the devolved administrations have recently implemented rule changes for travel announced in Westminster so it's thought they could follow suit. We brought you the news of Christmas markets returning this year in Birmingham and Manchester but there is less festive news in another major English city. The Leeds German Christmas market won't go ahead in 2021 and the cancellation will harm city centre businesses, according to a group that represents the hospitality industry. The market's organisers in Frankfurt have cancelled it for the second year running, because of uncertainty around coronavirus restrictions. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, tells BBC Radio Leeds: ""It's really devastating to have it cancelled for a second year. ""Christmas markets are becoming destinations in their own right, and you see a huge influx of people. You get people coming from across the region and across the country, even, boosting sales and making additional purchases in shops, cafes, pubs, bars, as well as the hotels."" Leeds City Council says it is ""disappointing"" the market is not going ahead, but adds there will still be events and food stalls in the city's Millennium Square. The Welsh government is being accused of a U-turn after announcing vaccine passes will be needed for entry into nightclubs and large events from 11 October. The Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Mark Drakeford had previously been against the idea. The party's leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, says: ""This is another disappointing U-turn from Labour's first minister who told me in July he was against the idea of people having to show a Covid passport to enter a venue or event in Wales. ""Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications."" He also highlights the fact the scheme will be introduced two weeks after the peak in infections as shown in the government's own modelling, and describes the timing as ""questionable"". ""For many, even those who support such a restriction, this looks like another perfect example of Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay closing the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" he adds. Some 10,000 fans were able to watch Manchester United draw with Fulham at Old Trafford on 18 May The 2020-21 football season will go down as the one that clubs survived despite having virtually no fans coming through the turnstiles - and new figures from one of the biggest clubs of all show the effect. The latest annual report from Manchester United shows that it went from matchday revenues ofÂ£89.8mdown to justÂ£7.1m. But at the same time, the money that the club made from broadcasters showing the matches to fans in the UK and around the world jumped fromÂ£140.2mtoÂ£254.8m,wiping out that shortfall. In case you've forgotten the reason that there was any matchday income at all... it was because clubs were able to get fans in for a match in the final week of the season as restrictions started to relax. The Red Devils were able to invite 10,000 paying fans to watch them draw against Fulham on 18 May. Back to our main Covid story this afternoon. The transport secretary has said he will announce measures to simplify foreign travel - so what are we expecting him to say? There is speculation that ministers will agree that fully vaccinated arrivals will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test or a post-arrival PCR test. This would save travellers around Â£100 per trip. According to reports, they could be required to quarantine at home and take two tests when arriving from a low-risk location under the new system. The changes would come into force ahead of the October half-term break. It is expected that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for solo travellers. There are 62 countries on the list but it is expected to be reduced. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia. The deal - seen as an effort to counter China - will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. But the move angered France, which said it had been ""stabbed in the back"", while China accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war. The alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. While they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing's influence in the contested South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea Mr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China. But the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China. She asked the prime minister about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Mr Johnson replied: ""The United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing."" Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Meanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a ""stab in the back"". He called it a ""brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision"" that reminded him of former US President Donald Trump. French diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation. This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? ""It's a very low moment,"" France's former ambassador to the US, GÃ©rard Araud, told the BBC's World Tonight programme. ""The US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn't care."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France ""a vital partner"" and said Washington would still work ""incredibly closely"" with Paris. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms. ""There are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don't, and they have partnerships with other countries that don't include us,"" she said. ""That is part of how global diplomacy works."" The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Mr Lovegrove said the pact was ""perhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades"". China, meanwhile,has accused the allies of having a ""Cold War mentality""that would hurt their own interests. The Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the ""first to die"" in a Chinese ""counterattack"". And on Friday, China's President Xi Jinping said foreign powers should not be allowed to interfere in the country's affairs. ""The future of our country's development and progress should lie firmly in our own hands,"" he said, according to state media. But Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing's reaction. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' ""This is not the first time that we've seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia's position,"" he said. ""We are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That's the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts."" Meanwhile,China applied to join a key Asia-Pacific trade pacton Thursday as it attempts to strengthen its position in the region. The country's foreign ministry, however, denied that the move to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was a response to the UK-US-Australia pact. Joining the CPTPP, which was signed in 2018 by 11 countries including Australia and Japan, would mark a significant boost to China's trading power.

"The murder of Sarah Everard in March prompted a public debate about women's safety Tackling violence against women and girls should be as much of a priority as countering terrorism, a police watchdog has said. It has identified major inconsistencies between police forces in how they tackle the issue. A report was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year. Police say they need more investment to help bring offenders more quickly to justice. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called for ""fundamental cross-system change"" after identifying continuing failings. Three-quarters of domestic abuse cases are closed early without the suspect being charged, its report said. Top police role to tackle violence against women How many attacks on woman are reported to police? West Midlands Police apologises for failing domestic abuse victim According to official statistics, in the year ending March 2020 there were: An estimated 1.6 million female victims of domestic abuse in England and Wales 618,000 female victims of sexual assault 892,000 female victims of stalking The HMICFRS said that the police have made ""vast improvements"" over a decade in dealing with this ""epidemic"" of violence - but there were still staggering variations between police forces. It said a police power which allows officers to tell women that a partner has a history of abuse, known as Clare's Law, was used so differently by individual forces it amounted to a postcode lottery. And too often, said the inspectors, police were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. That response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. These major crimes, said inspectors, were treated as national priorities, benefiting from a ""clearer focus, better funding and relentless pursuit"" of offenders. One woman, whose identity we are protecting, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the ""restrictive and aggressive"" domestic abuse she faced. ""I was very frightened, and had all my civil liberties curbed - where I went, what I did, who I met with, how I spent my money. ""I was very much in fear about what the next step what be."" On the occasions she did call the police, she says it was out of concern for her abuser - who made her feel ""responsible"" for his ""bad moods and angry outbursts"". Police did not understand that this ""was the nature of the abusive relationship"" she says, and officers initially treated the case as mental health-related. She says her abuser threatened to burn the house down and to kill himself, before physically assaulting her. He was arrested, but then released without charge, she explains, adding that a police officer told her that it was a matter of ""he-said-she-said"" and that there was ""no substantial evidence"". It takes a ""huge amount of courage"" to report abuse, she says, and ""the point when someone is released without charge really signifies to the victim that it's not worth ringing the police because they won't do anything."" Environment Secretary George Eustice said police forces must ""learn"" from each other to improve their approach to dealing with violence against women. He told Sky News: ""Obviously Priti Patel will now look at these recommendations but I think this report does highlight some differences between police forces. ""What we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well - and I think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others - and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country."" Sarah Everard was snatched by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on 3 March, and was then raped and strangled. The firearms officer has sincepleaded guilty to the 33-year-old's murder. Police were criticised for their handling of a vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard in March this year Zoe Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had ""vastly improved"" their response to tackling violence against women and girls in the last seven years. But she warned we would not be able to ""police our way out of the the breadth and depth of crimes being inflicted on women, day in, day out"". There needs to be an ""uplift in the prioritisation"" of violence against women and girls, with a ""bold and radical whole system approach"", she added. She said that councils, courts, teachers and the NHS - among others - should be expected to treat violence against women and girls ""as their business"" and work together to prevent it. When HMICFRS carried out fieldwork with four forces - Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Surrey and Humberside - it asked them to each identify 10 serious local offenders who posed an ongoing risk to women. Of the 40 individuals identified, 34 had not actually been flagged within the force's intelligence systems as being prolifically dangerous individuals. Labour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, urged the government to enact the report's recommendations and ensure it doesn't just ""gather dust on the shelf"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need the government to implement this report, to actually put in place the structures that this report proposes, and give it the prioritisation and we also need them to ensure that the resources are there."" Refuge, a charity providing support for women and children experiencing domestic violence, said for too long there had been a failure to implement recommendations that would improve how violence against women and girls (VAWG) is tackled. Ruth Davison, Refuge's chief executive, said: ""This must change. The report rightly calls for 'radical action' and we hope that the home secretary, who has commissioned this report, will look at the recommendations carefully and respond accordingly."" Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council leader on violence, said the report set out a ""clear way forward"" for change and that there was ""no lack of commitment"" for this work. She insisted that forces were recognising violence against women and girls as a ""significant priority"", adding that chief constables were signing up to a national violence against women and girls strategy and a co-ordinator would be employed to to ensure the report's recommendations were implemented. Responding to the report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said tackling violence against women and girls was a top priority for the government. She said: ""Our VAWG Strategy, which commits to radically changing how we end abuse using a whole system approach, focuses on working with key agencies including police, healthcare and education. ""We have already taken essential action including introducing a national police lead for tackling VAWG and making Relationship Education compulsory in all primary schools."" The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said the way police responded to violence against and girls had improved in recent years, but consistency and improvements were still needed. Sophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime and joint victims' lead for the APCC, added: ""The numbers of cases closed without a suspect being charged - either because of evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support a prosecution - shows that too many victims are still being let down.""

"A nightclub trade body has expressed concern over certification A decision on whether proof of vaccination will be legally required to enter nightclubs and large events in Wales will be revealed on Friday. Labour ministers have been considering Covid passports as part of their latest review of coronavirus restrictions. First Minister Mark Drakeford has not ruled out a mandatory system, which is planned for Scotland and may be used in England. However, a nightclub trade body warned the move may damage the industry. The Conservatives and the Lib Dems in the Senedd expressed concerns, and called for ministers not to implement such a scheme. No other changes are expected in the review to Wales' coronavirus laws, which weremostly scrappedover the summer. Who needs a Covid passport and how do I get one? Packed pilot festival brings the good times back The joy of headlining the UK's first post-lockdown gig Mr Drakeford, who will hold a press conference at Friday lunchtime, has expressed scepticism about what he said were legal, ethical and practical issues with vaccine certification. But he said hecould be persuadedof the need for a passport scheme should the public health benefits outweigh the drawbacks. He has ruled out passes being used forpublic services. Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October. One of the concerns some companies have raised in Scotland is the definition of a nightclub - ministers there are still working on it. Benjamin Newby of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said there is no ""standard definition"" to differentiate between different types of night-time venues. Vaccine passports not ruled out in Wales Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October In a letter to Mr Drakeford, he said: ""With no criteria to identify 'nightclubs', and with local authorities differing in licensing conditions, any implementation of vaccine certification will be inevitably arbitrary. ""We, as representatives of the Welsh night time economy, fear that such measures would be immensely difficult to implement, have a hugely detrimental impact on trade, and would result in some of the hardest-hit Welsh businesses losing out to those in England, with very little public health benefit."" He warned of confrontation between staff and disgruntled customers, and potential fraud. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said last week people will not need vaccine passports to access public services in Wales Panikos Myrittis, owner of 101 Nightclub, on St Mary Street, Cardiff, said vaccine passports are ""yet another challenge"" after the industry has ""suffered already"". He said he worries ""any more challenges thrown our way"" would be a ""hurdle too big"". ""We want to make it easy for the customers and for them to enjoy themselves. ""It's [vaccine passports] going to be a chore, an effort, we need to build nightclubs back up."" He questioned why other businesses are not being asked to comply with passport requirements, adding ""it doesn't make any sense to me to be honest"". Dr Mair Hopkin is the joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales and said vaccine passports are a ""very difficult decision"". She said: ""It may help those at risk or those who are anxious about going out to start socialising which is going to be good for their mental health. ""The passports have been introduced in France and seem to be successful there and their rates are going down quite rapidly. ""On the other hand we do need something that is not too difficult to implement and monitor. ""It is an imposition of our civil liberties but then we do have to accept impositions if that's for the good of the whole society and the majority of cases in Wales now are in younger people so we have to be aware that it is spreading more in younger generations than in older generations. ""We have the winter pressures coming up on the NHS and if the rates of Covid and Covid hospitalisations don't start to come down soon then we'll be in for a very, very difficult winter."" Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Conservatives had been ""clear in our opposition to vaccine passports, and we would encourage Labour ministers to ditch any plans they might have to introduce them"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said passports should be ruled out for public services, ""but if evidence shows that they could limit transmission in some settings where attendance was voluntary, it makes sense for them to be considered"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""Vaccine passports are an infringement of our civil liberties, and they will disproportionately exclude black and ethnic minority communities who have, to date, been more hesitant than others to get vaccinated."" Some large events have already been requiring participants to be either fully vaccinated or provide a negative test. Under the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to ""prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". The document says companies could be given a week's notice to implement the scheme. Certificates are already available in Wales through the nhs.uk website but not through the NHS app, which provides certificates in England. 2021 BAFTA CYMRU NOMINATED:Watch the cream of the crop ARTS AND HERITAGE:Lose yourself in Welsh creativity and culture First Covid booster jabs as youth antibody rate up Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination this autumn, as flu starts to spread at a higher level than in a normal year. Many southern hemisphere nations had their worst flu season for years, after the ending of Covid restrictions meant people mixed much more, andexperts predict the same is likely to happen in the UK. Having a vaccine will stop many people from becoming seriously ill,including children, and ease pressure on the health service. In England,the flu vaccine,externalis free for frontline health or social care workers, and those who: are 50 and over have certain health conditions are pregnant are in long-stay residential care are the main carer for an older or disabled person Adults aged 65 and over should be offered a vaccine with an extra ingredient that triggers a stronger response from the immune system. Anasal spray form of the vaccine,external, which is more suitable for children, is being offered to: 2- and 3-year-olds all primary school children secondary school children in years 7, 8 and 9 children aged six months to 17 years with long-term health conditions The oldest, youngest and the most vulnerable are being offered a jab first before other groups because they are at higher risk of complications. If there's enough supply, pupils in years 10 and 11 will also be offered a dose. For most people, the flu vaccine can be accessed via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. About26 million people in the UK are also being offered a booster jab against Covid. They may be offered flu and Covid jabs at the same time. UK must brace for big, early wave of flu - experts Health officials inScotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWalesare offering jabs to broadly similar groups of people - with some variations. Scottish parents urged to take up child flu vaccine offer Children are given the flu vaccine as a nasal spray Anyone can pay to have a private flu vaccine at pharmacies or some supermarkets, at a cost of about Â£15. However, officials say vaccine supplies will be prioritised for those at greatest risk who are entitled to a free jab via the NHS. The best time to get vaccinated is between late September and end of November because the flu season peaks in January or February, but it's still worth having it later. For many,flu typically lasts about two weeks,external, and clears up on its own. However, it can be very serious - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions. Pregnant women are advised to have the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available, regardless of their stage of pregnancy. Annual flu deaths vary each year, depending on the strain and other factors. More than 24,000 people died in England from flu and pneumonia in 2019 It can be hard to tell if you have flu or Covid as the symptoms can be similar, including: fever cough tiredness Some people also experience muscle-aches, a headache, sore throat or diarrhoea and vomiting with flu. But these symptoms can be caused by other common winter viruses too. Both flu and Covid can be spread before people have symptoms. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Social distancing reduced the spread of the flu last winter which has weakened people's immunity Yes, in which case you are more likely to be seriously ill. Research shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone. Do I need to isolate if I have Covid? How to look after yourself if you get Covid Most are mild and only last a day or two. They can include a slightly raised temperature, muscle-ache and a sore arm. Allergic reactions are rare, but you should avoid the vaccine if you have previously had a bad response to a flu vaccine. Those with egg allergies should ask their pharmacist or GP for a low-egg or egg-free vaccine. It is best to avoid the vaccine if you are ill with a high temperature, and re-book for when you are fully recovered.

First Minister Mark Drakeford has not ruled out a mandatory system, which is planned for Scotland and may be used in England. However, a nightclub trade body warned the move may damage the industry. The Conservatives and the Lib Dems in the Senedd expressed concerns, and called for ministers not to implement such a scheme. No other changes are expected in the review to Wales' coronavirus laws, which weremostly scrappedover the summer. Who needs a Covid passport and how do I get one? Packed pilot festival brings the good times back The joy of headlining the UK's first post-lockdown gig Mr Drakeford, who will hold a press conference at Friday lunchtime, has expressed scepticism about what he said were legal, ethical and practical issues with vaccine certification. But he said hecould be persuadedof the need for a passport scheme should the public health benefits outweigh the drawbacks. He has ruled out passes being used forpublic services. Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October. One of the concerns some companies have raised in Scotland is the definition of a nightclub - ministers there are still working on it. Benjamin Newby of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said there is no ""standard definition"" to differentiate between different types of night-time venues. Vaccine passports not ruled out in Wales Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October In a letter to Mr Drakeford, he said: ""With no criteria to identify 'nightclubs', and with local authorities differing in licensing conditions, any implementation of vaccine certification will be inevitably arbitrary. ""We, as representatives of the Welsh night time economy, fear that such measures would be immensely difficult to implement, have a hugely detrimental impact on trade, and would result in some of the hardest-hit Welsh businesses losing out to those in England, with very little public health benefit."" He warned of confrontation between staff and disgruntled customers, and potential fraud. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said last week people will not need vaccine passports to access public services in Wales Panikos Myrittis, owner of 101 Nightclub, on St Mary Street, Cardiff, said vaccine passports are ""yet another challenge"" after the industry has ""suffered already"". He said he worries ""any more challenges thrown our way"" would be a ""hurdle too big"". ""We want to make it easy for the customers and for them to enjoy themselves. ""It's [vaccine passports] going to be a chore, an effort, we need to build nightclubs back up."" He questioned why other businesses are not being asked to comply with passport requirements, adding ""it doesn't make any sense to me to be honest"". Dr Mair Hopkin is the joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales and said vaccine passports are a ""very difficult decision"". She said: ""It may help those at risk or those who are anxious about going out to start socialising which is going to be good for their mental health. ""The passports have been introduced in France and seem to be successful there and their rates are going down quite rapidly. ""On the other hand we do need something that is not too difficult to implement and monitor. ""It is an imposition of our civil liberties but then we do have to accept impositions if that's for the good of the whole society and the majority of cases in Wales now are in younger people so we have to be aware that it is spreading more in younger generations than in older generations. ""We have the winter pressures coming up on the NHS and if the rates of Covid and Covid hospitalisations don't start to come down soon then we'll be in for a very, very difficult winter."" Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Conservatives had been ""clear in our opposition to vaccine passports, and we would encourage Labour ministers to ditch any plans they might have to introduce them"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said passports should be ruled out for public services, ""but if evidence shows that they could limit transmission in some settings where attendance was voluntary, it makes sense for them to be considered"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""Vaccine passports are an infringement of our civil liberties, and they will disproportionately exclude black and ethnic minority communities who have, to date, been more hesitant than others to get vaccinated."" Some large events have already been requiring participants to be either fully vaccinated or provide a negative test. Under the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to ""prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". The document says companies could be given a week's notice to implement the scheme. Certificates are already available in Wales through the nhs.uk website but not through the NHS app, which provides certificates in England. 2021 BAFTA CYMRU NOMINATED:Watch the cream of the crop ARTS AND HERITAGE:Lose yourself in Welsh creativity and culture First Covid booster jabs as youth antibody rate up Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances in a bid to ease the ""unprecedented"" pressure on the NHS. Scottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie said logistical staff would also be made available to support paramedics and technicians. Ms Howie said the impact of Covid had placed the service at its ""highest level of escalation"". On Thursday, the Scottish government confirmed it had asked the MoD formilitary assistance. Ms Howie was asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme if it would mean soldiers driving NHS ambulances or army ambulances. She said: ""I would expect the former and we will be working through the details of that over the coming days."" Why is the Scottish Ambulance Service in 'crisis'? 'I thought my mum was going to die in front of us' Her comments came after it emerged an 86-year-old woman had towait eight hours for an ambulanceafter falling and breaking her hip at home. Lillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out. Her son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority. Mr Ewing told BBC Scotland: ""I thought she was going to die in front of us."" The Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Opposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. Ms Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were ""anomalies"". She said: ""The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes."" The chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances. Ms Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as ""unprecedented"" and added staff face an ""extremely challenging"" winter. Armed forces personnel are already involved in the Covid vaccination programme Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane told the programme the problem was not new and recalled one of his patients waiting eight hours for an ambulance in 2018. Highlighting the stress on all parts of the health service, he said on Monday alone he had 80 patient contacts during his GP shift. Dr Gulhane said: ""Ambulances queuing round the block. Record A&E waiting times. This is shining a light on a crumbling NHS that happened before Covid."" He also accused the Scottish government of using the pandemic as a ""smokescreen for everything"". Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie welcomed the involvement of the military. But she told Good Morning Scotland: ""What it demonstrates is that the ambulance service and the NHS are absolutely in crisis, and this is all before the winter starts."" Ms Baillie also said ministers had ""taken their eye off the ball"" and failed to respond to delays which were reported in June. She added efforts should now be made to bring back recently-retired staff and increase capacity. One suggestion has been to reopen the NHS Louisa Jordan at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow. The temporary facility, whichclosed in March, carried out outpatient and diagnostic appointments, hosted training and accepted blood donations. Dr John Montgomery told BBC Scotland'sThe Nine: ""Given that the critical problem that we face right now is lack of beds and the Louisa Jordan was set up effectively as a field hospital then, unfortunately, closing it because of the forthcomingCOP26may be one of the worst decisions we have made. ""The Louisa Jordan would have been a perfect place for the patients who might have required, not-necessarily high intervention levels of medicine, but perhaps required nursing care and would have been a perfect place for ambulances to take patients to."" The GP, who is based on the south side of Glasgow, added he is ""very, very fearful indeed"" for the winter ahead. The Scottish Ambulance Service said the current problems were not about capacity alone. Ms Howie added: ""I think the challenges are not just about facilities, they are about workforces as well. ""Across health and care services, there are workforce capacity challenges and those are being actively addressed by health boards."" On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services. She told the Scottish Parliament: ""I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible."" The first minister added: ""Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months."" A Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson joked that there was only one other cabinet member who had seen more delivery rooms than him Boris Johnson's new cabinet has met for the first time since he fired a string of ministers and brought in new faces in a wide-ranging reshuffle. The prime minister gave his new team what he called ""a half-time pep talk"". ""This is the moment when we spit out the orange peel, adjust our gum shields and get back on the pitch,"" he said. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson sacked three of his senior ministers including Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. But there were promotions for Liz Truss who becomes foreign secretary, Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary and Nadine Dorries was given the role of culture secretary. Michael Gove replaced Robert Jenrick as the new communities secretary. His appointment comes as thegovernment pauses its planning reforms, which have sparked concern among Conservative MPs. The BBC has been told that Mr Gove wants to take stock and discuss concerns with his colleagues. What's Johnson's reshuffle really all about? Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Peer leaves government amid emails controversy In the new Cabinet's first meeting, Mr Johnson praised his government as one ""that delivers things people previously thought was impossible"" citing Brexit and the vaccine programme. Boris Johnson told his new cabinet they were all there on ""merit"" He also said the government was going to ""get social care done"" and enable ""our NHS to bounce back from the pandemic"" as well as fulfilling ""our fundamental project of uniting and levelling up the whole country"". And in a joke about the number of children he has, he said: ""I've been thinking about delivery, I've seen a few delivery rooms, probably more delivery rooms than anyone else in this room."" He added that delivery ""normally involves a superhuman effort by at least one person in this room... but plenty of other people in that room who are essential to the success."" Oliver Dowden moved from the culture department to become Conservative co-chair, telling staff at party HQ to start preparing for a general election that could be in 20 months time,according to the Daily Telegraph.,external Asked if Mr Dowden was putting the party on an ""election footing"", Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""I think what Oliver Dowden said is that we should be ready for an election whenever it might come. ""We've still got several years left of this Parliament and we've got a lot that we want to achieve."" Dominic Raab leaves behind his job as foreign secretary to take up both the justice secretary role and the position of deputy prime minister. According to the Times,externalthis has put him on a collision course with his foreign office successor Ms Truss as both ministers vie for access to the government's country residence, Chevening House in Kent. Chevening House has been used since the 1980s as a country retreat and to host international visitors A Downing Street spokesperson said there was a ""long process in place for nominating access"" to the house which would get under way after the reshuffle had been concluded. As part of the reshuffle, a number of long-serving ministers lost their jobs including John Whittingdale at the culture department and education minister Nick Gibb, who had been in the role since 2014. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Whittingdale said he was sad to give up his job, adding: ""I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. ""Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do."" Other ministers returning to the back bench include: Caroline Dinenage, James Duddridge, Luke Hall,  Jesse Norman, Graham Stuart, Justin Tomlinson and Matt Warman. Suella Braverman retained her job as attorney general Penny Mordaunt lost her job as Paymaster General but was later made a minister in the Department for International Trade. Conor Burns, a long-term ally of Mr Johnson, had resigned his government job in May 2020 aftera report foundhe used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public. However he now returns to government taking on a ministerial role in the Northern Ireland Office. There were also a promotion for Alex Chalk who moves from being a justice minister to the position of Solicitor General. Victoria Atkins becomes a justice minister but will continue to manage the Afghan resettlement scheme, which she took on while at the Home Office. The appointment of Anne-Marie Trevelyan as International Trade Secretary was criticised by Labour who drew attention to the MP's previous tweets denying climate change. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said ""at least the last trade secretary only hired climate change deniers"", in an apparent referenceto former Australian premier Tony Abbott,who is a trade adviser.

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia. The deal - seen as an effort to counter China - will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. But the move angered France, which said it had been ""stabbed in the back"", while China accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war. The alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. While they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing's influence in the contested South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea Mr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China. But the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China. She asked the prime minister about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Mr Johnson replied: ""The United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing."" Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Meanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a ""stab in the back"". He called it a ""brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision"" that reminded him of former US President Donald Trump. French diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation. This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? ""It's a very low moment,"" France's former ambassador to the US, GÃ©rard Araud, told the BBC's World Tonight programme. ""The US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn't care."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France ""a vital partner"" and said Washington would still work ""incredibly closely"" with Paris. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms. ""There are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don't, and they have partnerships with other countries that don't include us,"" she said. ""That is part of how global diplomacy works."" The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Mr Lovegrove said the pact was ""perhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades"". China, meanwhile,has accused the allies of having a ""Cold War mentality""that would hurt their own interests. The Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the ""first to die"" in a Chinese ""counterattack"". And on Friday, China's President Xi Jinping said foreign powers should not be allowed to interfere in the country's affairs. ""The future of our country's development and progress should lie firmly in our own hands,"" he said, according to state media. But Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing's reaction. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' ""This is not the first time that we've seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia's position,"" he said. ""We are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That's the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts."" Meanwhile,China applied to join a key Asia-Pacific trade pacton Thursday as it attempts to strengthen its position in the region. The country's foreign ministry, however, denied that the move to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was a response to the UK-US-Australia pact. Joining the CPTPP, which was signed in 2018 by 11 countries including Australia and Japan, would mark a significant boost to China's trading power.

"Sir Clive Sinclair demonstrates his ill-fated electric C5 vehicle in 1985 Inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, who popularised the home computer and invented the pocket calculator, has died at his London home aged 81. His daughter Belinda Sinclair said he passed away on Thursday morning after having cancer for more than a decade. Sir Clive's products included the ZX series of computers and his ill-fated C5 electric vehicle. He was still working on his inventions last week ""because that was what he loved doing"", said Ms Sinclair. ""He was inventive and imaginative and for him it was exciting and an adventure, it was his passion,"" she added. Obituary: A tireless inventor Sinclair C5 'was ahead of its time' His ZX Spectrum computers brought affordable personal computing to the masses - selling in their millions across the world. However, in a BBC interview in 2013, Sir Clive revealed he did not, at that time, use computers himself. ""I don't like distraction,"" he explained. ""If I had a computer, I'd start thinking I could change this and that, and I don't want to. My wife very kindly looks after that for me."" This video can not be played Sir Clive Sinclair on personal computing Unlike the ZX Spectrum, his attempt to launch an electric vehicle was not successful. The C5 launched in 1985 and buyers were disappointed with its limited range, slow speed and inability to climb hills. It caused Sir Clive severe financial problems. His daughter said: ""I think sometimes he was a bit too early [with his inventions]. ""He was very good at imagining things that people might like or might need, even though they didn't know they wanted them."" He was a devoted father and grandfather who will be missed by her children Samuel, Henry and Florence, Ms Sinclair said.

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlines changes to rules around international travel The traffic list system is being simplified to just highlight red list countries, Shapps says Fully vaccinated people returning to England from non-red list countries will no longer need to take PCR tests from 4 October And eight countries are coming off the red list including Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives A further 32,651 coronavirus cases are recorded in the UK and 178 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test People will need a vaccine passport to enter nightclubs and attend large events in Wales from next month, First Minister Mark Drakeford announces Italy is to make it compulsory for all workers to have proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the virus A civil court case begins against the Austrian government over alleged mishandling of an outbreak at the ski resort of Ischgl in March 2020 Edited by James Clarke Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by James Clarke, Jen Meierhans, Jo Couzens, Alexandra Fouche and John Hand. We'll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a
recap of thechanges to the rules on foreign travel to and from England, announced within the past hour by the UK transport secretary: Covid patient Marcus Birks died in hospital in August Away from the travel changes, a funeral service has been held for a Covid sceptic who later urged people to get vaccinated when he was hospitalised with the virus. Musician Marcus Birks, 40, from Leek, Staffordshire, died in August after being admitted to Royal Stoke University Hospital. After initially declining the vaccine, he had said he was ""shocked"" to have become so unwell. During the service, a tribute was read on behalf of his wife, Lis Birks. Lis, who was pregnant with Marcus's son when he died, described her husband as her soul mate. The tribute read: ""Since the day we met there has never been a dull moment in our lives together. ""His passion, dedication, drive and commitment took me on a whirlwind 17-year journey down a path I could only have dreamed of going down."" Read more As the transport secretary unveils a new two-tier system for international travellers to the UK, the rules are changing. The traffic light system of countries is being scrapped, and fully vaccinated people will have to take fewer tests after travelling to most countries. Take a look atwhat the rules currently are - and what they are changing to. In a Department for Transport statement released to coincide with the announcement, Grant Shapps says: âTodayâs changes
mean a simpler, more straightforward system. ""One with less testing and lower
costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business
around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry."" He says that with ""more
than eight in 10 adults vaccinated in the UK, we are now
able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new
landscape"". The changes outlined by Grant Shapps for travellers arriving in England mean the current
traffic light system will be replaced by a single red list of countries and
territories - and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world
from 4 October. Before the new two-tiered system is introduced, eight additional countries and territories will
move off the red list. They are: This will take effect from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 22
September. You can read more on the changes here. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Over the summer scientists advising the governmentsaid the biggest threat to our health security,externalwas a coronavirus variant which could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. We've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases
of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. It started
spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the
virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it
was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital. Detecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated
travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they
arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to
genetically sequence the sample and find out
if the next potentially more dangerous variant had
arrived. We know that contracting Covid after two doses of a vaccine
is still possible, so double jabbed travellers could still bring new variants
into the UK. But critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples
that could be analysed in this way was very low â partly because a certain
level of virus was needed for the test to work properly.The latest figures suggest,externalthat between 12 August and 1 September only
about 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were
successfully sequenced. Under the new plans fully vaccinated
travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive,
lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home. LFTs cannot be sequenced
so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow-up PCR lab
test, which will be paid for by the NHS. But there is a worry that without regular,
automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through
the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tells reporters: ""We
wanted to bring a new simple, easier to navigate and cheaper system."" He says the changes will last ""into the new year at the very least"". The
purpose, he says, is to ""make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many
tests and with a greater level of certainty now that weâve got so many people
vaccinated"". Shapps says: ""Now
weâve got so many people vaccinated, perhaps nine out of 10 adults, it does
give us some additional freedoms. ""And one of those is that we can drop the
pre-departure tests. ""Another is that we can drop the expensive PCR tests on day

we will still require people to buy and use a lateral flow test."" From 4 October, people who are fully vaccinated will not need a pre-departure test before arrival into England from a non-red list country, says the transport secretary. And from later in October, those people will be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test. Grant Shapps also announces that eight countries and territories will come off the red list  from 04:00 BST on 22 September - they include Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives. The UK government is simplifying its travel traffic light system and testing rules for travellers, the transport secretary confirms. Grant Shapps says the government is ""introducing a new simplified system for international travel from Mon 4 Oct, replacing the current approach with a single red list  and simplified measures for the rest of the world - striking the right balance to manage the public health risk as No.1 priority"". Stay with us for more detail on what this means for holidaymakers in England. India administeredmore than 20 million Covid vaccine doses,externalin a day on Friday in a record-breaking effort to mark PM Narendra Modi's 71st birthday. The effort surpassed the country's previous daily record of more than 13 million doses on 27 August. India aims to vaccinate all eligible citizens by the end of 2021 but experts say the drive needs to pick up a consistent pace to meet the target. It has so far given more than 787 million doses of three approved jabs. More than half of India's eligible population - some 588 million people - have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to official data. But only about 20% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated since the beginning of the drive in January. Regional disparities also persist with larger and poorer states lagging behind smaller and richer ones. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths within 28 days of a positive test have increased by 5.1% from the previous week
(4 to 10 September), with 995 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 48. Cases have fallen 23.0% from the previous
week, with 206,332 recorded between 11 and 17 September, a
decrease of 61,548. Another 23,833 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 63,999 have had a second
vaccine dose now. That means 81.5% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 32,651 cases
of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And
there have been another 178 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the
previous 28 days. In anticipation of changes to foreign travel rules, independent holiday companies are calling for business grants through local authorities to help them recover from the pandemic. Gary Lewis, CEO of The Travel Network Group, which represents more than 1,200 members, says the anticipated simplification of
the traffic light system will be welcome news. ""However, these changes will come too late
for many businesses who have been severely impacted by a second summer season
decimated by Government restrictions and uncertainty over travel,"" he says. ""Businesses have faced extreme cash-flow problems and with the furlough
scheme coming to an end, travel business owners are now in an even more
difficult position than last September. âOur members are

grants to businesses affected by the pandemic. He says the
government needs to urgently provide a dedicated Travel Business Grant through the local authorities and ensure consistency of approach from authority

space but Chinese space personnel have told media that three astronauts will
now have to quarantine for 14 days after spending 90 days in space. Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo left for space in June to
carry outvarious projects at the Tianhe moduleof Chinaâs space station. It was Chinaâs longest-crewed space mission and theyreturned to earth earlier today, touching down in the Gobi Desert in north Chinaâs Inner
Mongolia region. When asked by Chinaâs national broadcaster why they needed to
follow the same quarantine measures as arrivals from overseas, Huang Weifen, chief designer of Chinaâs manned space project, said: âItâs unlikely that
they got infected with some virus during their flight - but their immune system
might have changed. ""Quarantine isintended to keep them safe,externaland sound."" Given that it is standard practice in the Covid-era for Chinese
people to log their travel history digitally when they return from overseas, users of
Chinaâs Twitter-like Sina Weibo are highly amused thatâspaceâ will seemingly be added to this system,externalas a destination. Others are asking how theyâll find ""isolation"" after isolating
themselves from the entire human race for three months. And some are questioning why itâs necessary for them to quarantine at
all - although there are jokes online about the crew, with users saying they have simply been on a ""long
business trip"". We are awaiting an announcement from transport secretary Grant Shapps on changes to foreign travel rules - but who will they apply to? The new rules will only definitely apply to England, as governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own. But the devolved administrations have recently implemented rule changes for travel announced in Westminster so it's thought they could follow suit. We brought you the news of Christmas markets returning this year in Birmingham and Manchester but there is less festive news in another major English city. The Leeds German Christmas market won't go ahead in 2021 and the cancellation will harm city centre businesses, according to a group that represents the hospitality industry. The market's organisers in Frankfurt have cancelled it for the second year running, because of uncertainty around coronavirus restrictions. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, tells BBC Radio Leeds: ""It's really devastating to have it cancelled for a second year. ""Christmas markets are becoming destinations in their own right, and you see a huge influx of people. You get people coming from across the region and across the country, even, boosting sales and making additional purchases in shops, cafes, pubs, bars, as well as the hotels."" Leeds City Council says it is ""disappointing"" the market is not going ahead, but adds there will still be events and food stalls in the city's Millennium Square. The Welsh government is being accused of a U-turn after announcing vaccine passes will be needed for entry into nightclubs and large events from 11 October. The Welsh Conservatives say First Minister Mark Drakeford had previously been against the idea. The party's leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, says: ""This is another disappointing U-turn from Labour's first minister who told me in July he was against the idea of people having to show a Covid passport to enter a venue or event in Wales. ""Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications."" He also highlights the fact the scheme will be introduced two weeks after the peak in infections as shown in the government's own modelling, and describes the timing as ""questionable"". ""For many, even those who support such a restriction, this looks like another perfect example of Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay closing the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" he adds. Some 10,000 fans were able to watch Manchester United draw with Fulham at Old Trafford on 18 May The 2020-21 football season will go down as the one that clubs survived despite having virtually no fans coming through the turnstiles - and new figures from one of the biggest clubs of all show the effect. The latest annual report from Manchester United shows that it went from matchday revenues ofÂ£89.8mdown to justÂ£7.1m. But at the same time, the money that the club made from broadcasters showing the matches to fans in the UK and around the world jumped fromÂ£140.2mtoÂ£254.8m,wiping out that shortfall. In case you've forgotten the reason that there was any matchday income at all... it was because clubs were able to get fans in for a match in the final week of the season as restrictions started to relax. The Red Devils were able to invite 10,000 paying fans to watch them draw against Fulham on 18 May. Back to our main Covid story this afternoon. The transport secretary has said he will announce measures to simplify foreign travel - so what are we expecting him to say? There is speculation that ministers will agree that fully vaccinated arrivals will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test or a post-arrival PCR test. This would save travellers around Â£100 per trip. According to reports, they could be required to quarantine at home and take two tests when arriving from a low-risk location under the new system. The changes would come into force ahead of the October half-term break. It is expected that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for solo travellers. There are 62 countries on the list but it is expected to be reduced. Â© 2025 BBC.

"North Korean state media put out images of the new cruise missile Earlier this week, North Korea announced it had successfully tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan. Cruise missiles, unlike ballistic missiles, can swerve and turn through most of their flight - allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. It shows North Korea is continuing its pursuit of ever more diverse and sophisticated means to deliver nuclear weapons. It's clear the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters, and internal economic difficulties have done little to deter North Korea's fundamental prioritisation of its nuclear deterrent. The latest successful test brings up a series of questions - why is North Korea doing this now, how significant is this, and what does it tell us about its priorities? North Korea has broadly been on a trajectory of qualitatively refining and quantitatively expanding its nuclear capabilities since the spring of 2019. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, since returning from the failed February 2019 summit with former U.S. President Donald J. Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, expressed resolve to continue investing in North Korea's nuclear deterrent and pursuing a ""self-reliant"" national defence strategy. But why is North Korea choosing to do this even as it struggles through food shortages and a deepening economic crisis? It serves multiple ends. Internally, these tests amplify Mr Kim's narrative of pursuing self-reliance in national defence and bolsters morale. In practical terms, new capabilities, like these cruise missiles, complicate planning by North Korea's adversaries, who must now contend with new capabilities. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North and South Korea test missiles hours apart Unlike ballistic missiles, cruise missiles fly low and slow towards their target. The cruise missiles North Korea tested recently covered a range of some 1,500km (930 miles) over a little more than two hours of flight time. Ballistic missiles of equivalent range would take a matter of minutes, but North Korea's interest in cruise missiles may be due to the difficulty for its adversaries in detecting their launches and in defending against them. North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons since IAEA inspectors were expelled And what these tests show is that Mr Kim - despite openly contending with the country's difficulties - has maintained his determination to continue advancing his nuclear capabilities. Unless we see a fundamental shift in priorities by North Korea or successful diplomatic outreach by the United States, Pyongyang should be expected to continue refining and advancing its capabilities. But is it notable that North Korea chose to introduce this weapon system at this point in time? Despite commentary to the contrary, the introduction of this weapon system and its testing likely have little to do with the policy specifics of the Biden administration or the twentieth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, which coincided with these recent tests. Of greatest concern to South Korea, Japan, and the international community is the North Korean state media description of these newly tested missiles as ""strategic weapons."" This usually means that the regime hopes to attach a nuclear warhead to the weapon. No previous cruise missile system in North Korea has had an implied nuclear weapon delivery role. But the development of these cruise missiles shouldn't come as a surprise. Mr Kim had in January 2021 announced that such a system was under development. He also implied that this missile system could be used in the future for a potential tactical nuclear weapon delivery role. Cruise missiles are also functionally different from ballistic missiles - which the North tested just two days later. The UN Security Council sanctions actually forbid North Korea from testing ballistic missiles - but not cruise missiles. This is because it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry a bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range and can fly faster. This video can not be played Why does North Korea keep launching missiles? But unlike ballistic missiles, which have a limited ability to manoeuvre in the final stages of their flight, as their payloads hurtle down to the earth, cruise missiles can swerve and turn through the majority of their flight, allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. Meanwhile, their low altitude flight means that ground-based radar systems will often only detect these missiles in the final stages of their flight, when it may be too low to successfully attempt to intercept them. Cruise missiles aren't a fundamentally new technology for North Korea. For years now, it has tested and refined Soviet-derived anti-ship cruise missiles. The recently tested missiles, however, exceed the range of those older cruise missiles by an order of magnitude. But these cruise missiles are but one part of this broader effort by North Korea. As the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency recently assessed, Pyongyang has also resumed operations at the gas-graphite reactor at the Yongbyon complex, implying the resumed production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The test of ballistic missiles in the days after the cruise missile tests underscores the possibility of North Korea resuming a sustained campaign of missile development, testing, and evaluation.

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlines changes to rules around international travel The traffic list system is being simplified to just highlight red list countries, Shapps says Fully vaccinated people returning to England from non-red list countries will no longer need to take PCR tests from 4 October And eight countries are coming off the red list including Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives A further 32,651 coronavirus cases are recorded in the UK and 178 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test People will need a vaccine passport to enter nightclubs and attend large events in Wales from next month, First Minister Mark Drakeford announces Italy is to make it compulsory for all workers to have proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the virus A civil court case begins against the Austrian government over alleged mishandling of an outbreak at the ski resort of Ischgl in March 2020 Edited by James Clarke Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by James Clarke, Jen Meierhans, Jo Couzens, Alexandra Fouche and John Hand. We'll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a
recap of thechanges to the rules on foreign travel to and from England, announced within the past hour by the UK transport secretary: Covid patient Marcus Birks died in hospital in August Away from the travel changes, a funeral service has been held for a Covid sceptic who later urged people to get vaccinated when he was hospitalised with the virus. Musician Marcus Birks, 40, from Leek, Staffordshire, died in August after being admitted to Royal Stoke University Hospital. After initially declining the vaccine, he had said he was ""shocked"" to have become so unwell. During the service, a tribute was read on behalf of his wife, Lis Birks. Lis, who was pregnant with Marcus's son when he died, described her husband as her soul mate. The tribute read: ""Since the day we met there has never been a dull moment in our lives together. ""His passion, dedication, drive and commitment took me on a whirlwind 17-year journey down a path I could only have dreamed of going down."" Read more As the transport secretary unveils a new two-tier system for international travellers to the UK, the rules are changing. The traffic light system of countries is being scrapped, and fully vaccinated people will have to take fewer tests after travelling to most countries. Take a look atwhat the rules currently are - and what they are changing to. In a Department for Transport statement released to coincide with the announcement, Grant Shapps says: âTodayâs changes
mean a simpler, more straightforward system. ""One with less testing and lower
costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business
around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry."" He says that with ""more
than eight in 10 adults vaccinated in the UK, we are now
able to introduce a proportionate updated structure that reflects the new
landscape"". The changes outlined by Grant Shapps for travellers arriving in England mean the current
traffic light system will be replaced by a single red list of countries and
territories - and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world
from 4 October. Before the new two-tiered system is introduced, eight additional countries and territories will
move off the red list. They are: This will take effect from 04:00 BST on Wednesday 22
September. You can read more on the changes here. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Over the summer scientists advising the governmentsaid the biggest threat to our health security,externalwas a coronavirus variant which could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. We've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases
of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. It started
spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the
virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it
was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital. Detecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated
travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they
arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to
genetically sequence the sample and find out
if the next potentially more dangerous variant had
arrived. We know that contracting Covid after two doses of a vaccine
is still possible, so double jabbed travellers could still bring new variants
into the UK. But critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples
that could be analysed in this way was very low â partly because a certain
level of virus was needed for the test to work properly.The latest figures suggest,externalthat between 12 August and 1 September only
about 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were
successfully sequenced. Under the new plans fully vaccinated
travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive,
lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home. LFTs cannot be sequenced
so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow-up PCR lab
test, which will be paid for by the NHS. But there is a worry that without regular,
automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through
the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tells reporters: ""We
wanted to bring a new simple, easier to navigate and cheaper system."" He says the changes will last ""into the new year at the very least"". The
purpose, he says, is to ""make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many
tests and with a greater level of certainty now that weâve got so many people
vaccinated"". Shapps says: ""Now
weâve got so many people vaccinated, perhaps nine out of 10 adults, it does
give us some additional freedoms. ""And one of those is that we can drop the
pre-departure tests. ""Another is that we can drop the expensive PCR tests on day
two when people got back from abroad. ""But
we will still require people to buy and use a lateral flow test."" From 4 October, people who are fully vaccinated will not need a pre-departure test before arrival into England from a non-red list country, says the transport secretary. And from later in October, those people will be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test.

"The murder of Sarah Everard in March prompted a public debate about women's safety Tackling violence against women and girls should be as much of a priority as countering terrorism, a police watchdog has said. It has identified major inconsistencies between police forces in how they tackle the issue. A report was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year. Police say they need more investment to help bring offenders more quickly to justice. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called for ""fundamental cross-system change"" after identifying continuing failings. Three-quarters of domestic abuse cases are closed early without the suspect being charged, its report said. Top police role to tackle violence against women How many attacks on woman are reported to police? West Midlands Police apologises for failing domestic abuse victim According to official statistics, in the year ending March 2020 there were: An estimated 1.6 million female victims of domestic abuse in England and Wales 618,000 female victims of sexual assault 892,000 female victims of stalking The HMICFRS said that the police have made ""vast improvements"" over a decade in dealing with this ""epidemic"" of violence - but there were still staggering variations between police forces. It said a police power which allows officers to tell women that a partner has a history of abuse, known as Clare's Law, was used so differently by individual forces it amounted to a postcode lottery. And too often, said the inspectors, police were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. That response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. These major crimes, said inspectors, were treated as national priorities, benefiting from a ""clearer focus, better funding and relentless pursuit"" of offenders. One woman, whose identity we are protecting, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the ""restrictive and aggressive"" domestic abuse she faced. ""I was very frightened, and had all my civil liberties curbed - where I went, what I did, who I met with, how I spent my money. ""I was very much in fear about what the next step what be."" On the occasions she did call the police, she says it was out of concern for her abuser - who made her feel ""responsible"" for his ""bad moods and angry outbursts"". Police did not understand that this ""was the nature of the abusive relationship"" she says, and officers initially treated the case as mental health-related. She says her abuser threatened to burn the house down and to kill himself, before physically assaulting her. He was arrested, but then released without charge, she explains, adding that a police officer told her that it was a matter of ""he-said-she-said"" and that there was ""no substantial evidence"". It takes a ""huge amount of courage"" to report abuse, she says, and ""the point when someone is released without charge really signifies to the victim that it's not worth ringing the police because they won't do anything."" Environment Secretary George Eustice said police forces must ""learn"" from each other to improve their approach to dealing with violence against women. He told Sky News: ""Obviously Priti Patel will now look at these recommendations but I think this report does highlight some differences between police forces. ""What we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well - and I think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others - and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country."" Sarah Everard was snatched by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on 3 March, and was then raped and strangled. The firearms officer has sincepleaded guilty to the 33-year-old's murder. Police were criticised for their handling of a vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard in March this year Zoe Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had ""vastly improved"" their response to tackling violence against women and girls in the last seven years. But she warned we would not be able to ""police our way out of the the breadth and depth of crimes being inflicted on women, day in, day out"". There needs to be an ""uplift in the prioritisation"" of violence against women and girls, with a ""bold and radical whole system approach"", she added. She said that councils, courts, teachers and the NHS - among others - should be expected to treat violence against women and girls ""as their business"" and work together to prevent it. When HMICFRS carried out fieldwork with four forces - Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Surrey and Humberside - it asked them to each identify 10 serious local offenders who posed an ongoing risk to women. Of the 40 individuals identified, 34 had not actually been flagged within the force's intelligence systems as being prolifically dangerous individuals. Labour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, urged the government to enact the report's recommendations and ensure it doesn't just ""gather dust on the shelf"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need the government to implement this report, to actually put in place the structures that this report proposes, and give it the prioritisation and we also need them to ensure that the resources are there."" Refuge, a charity providing support for women and children experiencing domestic violence, said for too long there had been a failure to implement recommendations that would improve how violence against women and girls (VAWG) is tackled. Ruth Davison, Refuge's chief executive, said: ""This must change. The report rightly calls for 'radical action' and we hope that the home secretary, who has commissioned this report, will look at the recommendations carefully and respond accordingly."" Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council leader on violence, said the report set out a ""clear way forward"" for change and that there was ""no lack of commitment"" for this work. She insisted that forces were recognising violence against women and girls as a ""significant priority"", adding that chief constables were signing up to a national violence against women and girls strategy and a co-ordinator would be employed to to ensure the report's recommendations were implemented. Responding to the report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said tackling violence against women and girls was a top priority for the government. She said: ""Our VAWG Strategy, which commits to radically changing how we end abuse using a whole system approach, focuses on working with key agencies including police, healthcare and education. ""We have already taken essential action including introducing a national police lead for tackling VAWG and making Relationship Education compulsory in all primary schools."" The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said the way police responded to violence against and girls had improved in recent years, but consistency and improvements were still needed. Sophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime and joint victims' lead for the APCC, added: ""The numbers of cases closed without a suspect being charged - either because of evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support a prosecution - shows that too many victims are still being let down.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia. The deal - seen as an effort to counter China - will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. But the move angered France, which said it had been ""stabbed in the back"", while China accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". And the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war. The alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. While they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing's influence in the contested South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea Mr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China. But the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China. She asked the prime minister about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Mr Johnson replied: ""The United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing."" Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Meanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a ""stab in the back"". He called it a ""brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision"" that reminded him of former US President Donald Trump. French diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation. This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? ""It's a very low moment,"" France's former ambassador to the US, GÃ©rard Araud, told the BBC's World Tonight programme. ""The US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn't care."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France ""a vital partner"" and said Washington would still work ""incredibly closely"" with Paris. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms. ""There are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don't, and they have partnerships with other countries that don't include us,"" she said. ""That is part of how global diplomacy works."" The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Mr Lovegrove said the pact was ""perhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades"". China, meanwhile,has accused the allies of having a ""Cold War mentality""that would hurt their own interests. The Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the ""first to die"" in a Chinese ""counterattack"". And on Friday, China's President Xi Jinping said foreign powers should not be allowed to interfere in the country's affairs. ""The future of our country's development and progress should lie firmly in our own hands,"" he said, according to state media. But Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing's reaction. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' ""This is not the first time that we've seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia's position,"" he said. ""We are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That's the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts."" Meanwhile,China applied to join a key Asia-Pacific trade pacton Thursday as it attempts to strengthen its position in the region. The country's foreign ministry, however, denied that the move to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was a response to the UK-US-Australia pact. Joining the CPTPP, which was signed in 2018 by 11 countries including Australia and Japan, would mark a significant boost to China's trading power.

"This video can not be played 'It isn't a neutral statement politically' Irish President Michael D Higgins has continued to defend his decision not to attend a church service to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland. The Queen is among the guests due to attend the event in Armagh on 21 October, and Mr Higgins denied that his decision was a snub to the Queen. He said he declined the invite because the event had become politicised. President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. The Armagh church service has been organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". Speaking in Rome, where he met Pope Francis on Friday, President Higgins said he felt the title ""wasn't a neutral statement politically"". He explained that he had been considering the invitation for about six months, and in the week before St Patrick's Day, he shared his concerns with the organisers of the event. President Higgins said he recalled saying: ""We must do everything we can to support each other's events, but if this event is titled as it is, and structured as it is, it would present difficulties."" During an interview with theIrish Times,externalon Thursday, President Higgins also said he had been incorrectly referred to as the president of the Republic of Ireland in the invitation rather than the president of Ireland. However, in the press conference in Rome, he corrected his earlier statement about how he had been titled. ""I do want to clarify one point in my interview yesterday with Harry [McGee], that I may be responsible for creating a small confusion, and that is - the organisers writing to my office have always referred to me as president of Ireland,"" he said. ""The reference to the president of the Republic of Ireland is really the remark of the leadership of the DUP."" Pope Francis with Irish President Michael D Higgins during his visit to the Vatican on Friday morning President Higgins insisted that he had been a ""regular"" visitor to Northern Ireland and ""had no difficulties appearing in Northern Ireland with Her Majesty"". He explained that his decision to decline the invitation was not a sudden one, saying he had given the matter proper consideration. ""When you are president, and you are responsible for the long vision you have to take all of the consequences into account and all of the interpretations, and I did that,"" he said. The president also took issue with some commentators who had criticised his decision not to attend the Armagh event and those who were ""telling me what I have to do"". In his newspaper interview on Thursday, the president said he was ""not snubbing anyone and I am not part of anyone's boycott or any other events in Northern Ireland"". ""I wish their service well but they understand that I have the right to exercise discretion as to what I think is appropriate,"" he added. DUP asks Higgins to rethink centenary invite Irish president declines invite to NI100 service The president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a ""disappointing and retrograde step"". However, President Higgins said criticism from the DUP was ""a bit much"". ""I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events. There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now."" Sir Jeffrey said the president's comments were ""not conducive to reconciliation"" and added that he was disappointed by his remarks about the DUP. President Higgins with the Queen, who has also been invited to the service, during a state visit to the UK in 2014 He told BBC Radio UIster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday morning that the church service was intended to mark the event of the centenary and ""reflect where we are"". ""It is not just my party that has raised this as a concern. unionists will be disappointed,"" he said. ""Failing to recognise the existence of Northern Ireland does not help anybody."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, however, tweeted that the partition of Ireland had been a ""catastrophe for our people and our country"". Allow Twitter content?

She added: ""The partition of Ireland costs us to this day, holds us back, divides us. UachtarÃ¡n na hÃireann has made clear his decision not to attend a commemorative event. His decision is the correct one."" Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Declan Kearney, speaking at another centenary event held in Belfast on Friday, said the party had not yet received an invitation to October's church service but added: ""If we do so, we too will be declining it."" The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland said it would have been ""very special"" if President Higgins was able to attend the church service and said his absence was ""unexpected"". Archbishop Eamon Martin added that the event was ""completely non-political"" and was intended to provide a moment for prayer and reflection. Newly appointed Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, also in attendance at the Union Theological College service, said it was ""a matter for the president of the Irish Republic to decide what diary commitments he accepts and what he doesn't"". ""We will carry on marking a very historic, inclusive event for all communities in Northern Ireland,"" he added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called for political leaders across the island to ""pause and reflect on the weight of their words"". He said ""cynical criticism"" of President Higgins' decision not to attend the event would ""not advance the cause of reconciliation, particularly when it comes from quarters that have downplayed and degraded the importance of all-island cooperation for two decades"". ""I would respectfully ask that those for whom this is disappointing reflect on the honest remarks made by President Higgins last night and understand the views of those for whom partition is not a cause for celebration or commemoration,"" he added. Once elected Irish presidents, like the Queen, are rarely criticised and are expected to be above daily politics. So, it is no surprise there has been to date a largely muted reaction south of the border to President Higgins' decision not to attend the centenary event organised by the four main Christian churches. Those few voices that have asked him to reconsider his position have done so in the name of north-south reconciliation - a cause he would argue he has been to the forefront of with hisfirst state visit to the UK by an Irish president. Those who support his decision say no head of state of any country could acquiesce to an event that marked the partitioning of his country and caused huge harm. In past comments, President Higgins, who was a left-wing politician, has spoken about ""ethical remembrance"" and reminding the British of their role in colonialism and imperialism and the legacy of that for descendants. While his non-attendance at the event has been criticised by unionist and other politicians, it is unlikely to damage his reputation south of the border where the controversy is largely seen as - at least until now - a ""political bubble"" story. Responding to President Higgins' explanation for not attending the church service, Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt said he had previously admired the president's outreach. ""If there was a problem with language then there is no reason why the presidential support staff could not have opened a quiet back channel to resolve all issues of language,"" he said. He added that the issue had the potential to ""infect good relations and reconciliation"". Alliance MP Stephen Farry previously called on President Higgins to reconsider his decision, saying the event was ""very much in keeping with the reconciliation efforts of successive Irish presidents and the Queen"". Simon Coveney says the government did not give ""clear advice"" on whether or not President Higgins should attend Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney travelled to Belfast on Friday to continue talks with Stormont parties as the controversy over the service continues. Speaking ahead of another event to mark the centenary organised by the Presbyterian church, he confirmed the Irish government had been consulted about the president's invitation to the church service. But he said there was no ""clear advice"" given on whether or not he should attend. He added President Higgins had made his own decision and that had to be respected. The Irish government previously said the issue of attendance at the service was a matter for the president alone and any invitation for a government representative to attend would be considered.

"North Korean state media put out images of the new cruise missile Earlier this week, North Korea announced it had successfully tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan. Cruise missiles, unlike ballistic missiles, can swerve and turn through most of their flight - allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. It shows North Korea is continuing its pursuit of ever more diverse and sophisticated means to deliver nuclear weapons. It's clear the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters, and internal economic difficulties have done little to deter North Korea's fundamental prioritisation of its nuclear deterrent. The latest successful test brings up a series of questions - why is North Korea doing this now, how significant is this, and what does it tell us about its priorities? North Korea has broadly been on a trajectory of qualitatively refining and quantitatively expanding its nuclear capabilities since the spring of 2019. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, since returning from the failed February 2019 summit with former U.S. President Donald J. Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, expressed resolve to continue investing in North Korea's nuclear deterrent and pursuing a ""self-reliant"" national defence strategy. But why is North Korea choosing to do this even as it struggles through food shortages and a deepening economic crisis? It serves multiple ends. Internally, these tests amplify Mr Kim's narrative of pursuing self-reliance in national defence and bolsters morale. In practical terms, new capabilities, like these cruise missiles, complicate planning by North Korea's adversaries, who must now contend with new capabilities. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North and South Korea test missiles hours apart Unlike ballistic missiles, cruise missiles fly low and slow towards their target. The cruise missiles North Korea tested recently covered a range of some 1,500km (930 miles) over a little more than two hours of flight time. Ballistic missiles of equivalent range would take a matter of minutes, but North Korea's interest in cruise missiles may be due to the difficulty for its adversaries in detecting their launches and in defending against them. North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons since IAEA inspectors were expelled And what these tests show is that Mr Kim - despite openly contending with the country's difficulties - has maintained his determination to continue advancing his nuclear capabilities. Unless we see a fundamental shift in priorities by North Korea or successful diplomatic outreach by the United States, Pyongyang should be expected to continue refining and advancing its capabilities. But is it notable that North Korea chose to introduce this weapon system at this point in time? Despite commentary to the contrary, the introduction of this weapon system and its testing likely have little to do with the policy specifics of the Biden administration or the twentieth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, which coincided with these recent tests. Of greatest concern to South Korea, Japan, and the international community is the North Korean state media description of these newly tested missiles as ""strategic weapons."" This usually means that the regime hopes to attach a nuclear warhead to the weapon. No previous cruise missile system in North Korea has had an implied nuclear weapon delivery role. But the development of these cruise missiles shouldn't come as a surprise. Mr Kim had in January 2021 announced that such a system was under development. He also implied that this missile system could be used in the future for a potential tactical nuclear weapon delivery role. Cruise missiles are also functionally different from ballistic missiles - which the North tested just two days later. The UN Security Council sanctions actually forbid North Korea from testing ballistic missiles - but not cruise missiles. This is because it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry a bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range and can fly faster. This video can not be played Why does North Korea keep launching missiles? But unlike ballistic missiles, which have a limited ability to manoeuvre in the final stages of their flight, as their payloads hurtle down to the earth, cruise missiles can swerve and turn through the majority of their flight, allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. Meanwhile, their low altitude flight means that ground-based radar systems will often only detect these missiles in the final stages of their flight, when it may be too low to successfully attempt to intercept them. Cruise missiles aren't a fundamentally new technology for North Korea. For years now, it has tested and refined Soviet-derived anti-ship cruise missiles. The recently tested missiles, however, exceed the range of those older cruise missiles by an order of magnitude. But these cruise missiles are but one part of this broader effort by North Korea. As the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency recently assessed, Pyongyang has also resumed operations at the gas-graphite reactor at the Yongbyon complex, implying the resumed production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The test of ballistic missiles in the days after the cruise missile tests underscores the possibility of North Korea resuming a sustained campaign of missile development, testing, and evaluation.

"A nightclub trade body has expressed concern over certification A decision on whether proof of vaccination will be legally required to enter nightclubs and large events in Wales will be revealed on Friday. Labour ministers have been considering Covid passports as part of their latest review of coronavirus restrictions. First Minister Mark Drakeford has not ruled out a mandatory system, which is planned for Scotland and may be used in England. However, a nightclub trade body warned the move may damage the industry. The Conservatives and the Lib Dems in the Senedd expressed concerns, and called for ministers not to implement such a scheme. No other changes are expected in the review to Wales' coronavirus laws, which weremostly scrappedover the summer. Who needs a Covid passport and how do I get one? Packed pilot festival brings the good times back The joy of headlining the UK's first post-lockdown gig Mr Drakeford, who will hold a press conference at Friday lunchtime, has expressed scepticism about what he said were legal, ethical and practical issues with vaccine certification. But he said hecould be persuadedof the need for a passport scheme should the public health benefits outweigh the drawbacks. He has ruled out passes being used forpublic services. Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October. One of the concerns some companies have raised in Scotland is the definition of a nightclub - ministers there are still working on it. Benjamin Newby of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said there is no ""standard definition"" to differentiate between different types of night-time venues. Vaccine passports not ruled out in Wales Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October In a letter to Mr Drakeford, he said: ""With no criteria to identify 'nightclubs', and with local authorities differing in licensing conditions, any implementation of vaccine certification will be inevitably arbitrary. ""We, as representatives of the Welsh night time economy, fear that such measures would be immensely difficult to implement, have a hugely detrimental impact on trade, and would result in some of the hardest-hit Welsh businesses losing out to those in England, with very little public health benefit."" He warned of confrontation between staff and disgruntled customers, and potential fraud. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said last week people will not need vaccine passports to access public services in Wales Panikos Myrittis, owner of 101 Nightclub, on St Mary Street, Cardiff, said vaccine passports are ""yet another challenge"" after the industry has ""suffered already"". He said he worries ""any more challenges thrown our way"" would be a ""hurdle too big"". ""We want to make it easy for the customers and for them to enjoy themselves. ""It's [vaccine passports] going to be a chore, an effort, we need to build nightclubs back up."" He questioned why other businesses are not being asked to comply with passport requirements, adding ""it doesn't make any sense to me to be honest"". Dr Mair Hopkin is the joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales and said vaccine passports are a ""very difficult decision"". She said: ""It may help those at risk or those who are anxious about going out to start socialising which is going to be good for their mental health. ""The passports have been introduced in France and seem to be successful there and their rates are going down quite rapidly. ""On the other hand we do need something that is not too difficult to implement and monitor. ""It is an imposition of our civil liberties but then we do have to accept impositions if that's for the good of the whole society and the majority of cases in Wales now are in younger people so we have to be aware that it is spreading more in younger generations than in older generations. ""We have the winter pressures coming up on the NHS and if the rates of Covid and Covid hospitalisations don't start to come down soon then we'll be in for a very, very difficult winter."" Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Conservatives had been ""clear in our opposition to vaccine passports, and we would encourage Labour ministers to ditch any plans they might have to introduce them"". Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said passports should be ruled out for public services, ""but if evidence shows that they could limit transmission in some settings where attendance was voluntary, it makes sense for them to be considered"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""Vaccine passports are an infringement of our civil liberties, and they will disproportionately exclude black and ethnic minority communities who have, to date, been more hesitant than others to get vaccinated."" Some large events have already been requiring participants to be either fully vaccinated or provide a negative test. Under the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to ""prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". The document says companies could be given a week's notice to implement the scheme. Certificates are already available in Wales through the nhs.uk website but not through the NHS app, which provides certificates in England. 2021 BAFTA CYMRU NOMINATED:Watch the cream of the crop ARTS AND HERITAGE:Lose yourself in Welsh creativity and culture First Covid booster jabs as youth antibody rate up Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"The murder of Sarah Everard in March prompted a public debate about women's safety Tackling violence against women and girls should be as much of a priority as countering terrorism, a police watchdog has said. It has identified major inconsistencies between police forces in how they tackle the issue. A report was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year. Police say they need more investment to help bring offenders more quickly to justice. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called for ""fundamental cross-system change"" after identifying continuing failings. Three-quarters of domestic abuse cases are closed early without the suspect being charged, its report said. Top police role to tackle violence against women How many attacks on woman are reported to police? West Midlands Police apologises for failing domestic abuse victim According to official statistics, in the year ending March 2020 there were: An estimated 1.6 million female victims of domestic abuse in England and Wales 618,000 female victims of sexual assault 892,000 female victims of stalking The HMICFRS said that the police have made ""vast improvements"" over a decade in dealing with this ""epidemic"" of violence - but there were still staggering variations between police forces. It said a police power which allows officers to tell women that a partner has a history of abuse, known as Clare's Law, was used so differently by individual forces it amounted to a postcode lottery. And too often, said the inspectors, police were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. That response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. These major crimes, said inspectors, were treated as national priorities, benefiting from a ""clearer focus, better funding and relentless pursuit"" of offenders. One woman, whose identity we are protecting, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the ""restrictive and aggressive"" domestic abuse she faced. ""I was very frightened, and had all my civil liberties curbed - where I went, what I did, who I met with, how I spent my money. ""I was very much in fear about what the next step what be."" On the occasions she did call the police, she says it was out of concern for her abuser - who made her feel ""responsible"" for his ""bad moods and angry outbursts"". Police did not understand that this ""was the nature of the abusive relationship"" she says, and officers initially treated the case as mental health-related. She says her abuser threatened to burn the house down and to kill himself, before physically assaulting her. He was arrested, but then released without charge, she explains, adding that a police officer told her that it was a matter of ""he-said-she-said"" and that there was ""no substantial evidence"". It takes a ""huge amount of courage"" to report abuse, she says, and ""the point when someone is released without charge really signifies to the victim that it's not worth ringing the police because they won't do anything."" Environment Secretary George Eustice said police forces must ""learn"" from each other to improve their approach to dealing with violence against women. He told Sky News: ""Obviously Priti Patel will now look at these recommendations but I think this report does highlight some differences between police forces. ""What we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well - and I think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others - and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country."" Sarah Everard was snatched by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on 3 March, and was then raped and strangled. The firearms officer has sincepleaded guilty to the 33-year-old's murder. Police were criticised for their handling of a vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard in March this year Zoe Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had ""vastly improved"" their response to tackling violence against women and girls in the last seven years. But she warned we would not be able to ""police our way out of the the breadth and depth of crimes being inflicted on women, day in, day out"". There needs to be an ""uplift in the prioritisation"" of violence against women and girls, with a ""bold and radical whole system approach"", she added. She said that councils, courts, teachers and the NHS - among others - should be expected to treat violence against women and girls ""as their business"" and work together to prevent it. When HMICFRS carried out fieldwork with four forces - Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Surrey and Humberside - it asked them to each identify 10 serious local offenders who posed an ongoing risk to women. Of the 40 individuals identified, 34 had not actually been flagged within the force's intelligence systems as being prolifically dangerous individuals. Labour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, urged the government to enact the report's recommendations and ensure it doesn't just ""gather dust on the shelf"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need the government to implement this report, to actually put in place the structures that this report proposes, and give it the prioritisation and we also need them to ensure that the resources are there."" Refuge, a charity providing support for women and children experiencing domestic violence, said for too long there had been a failure to implement recommendations that would improve how violence against women and girls (VAWG) is tackled. Ruth Davison, Refuge's chief executive, said: ""This must change. The report rightly calls for 'radical action' and we hope that the home secretary, who has commissioned this report, will look at the recommendations carefully and respond accordingly."" Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council leader on violence, said the report set out a ""clear way forward"" for change and that there was ""no lack of commitment"" for this work. She insisted that forces were recognising violence against women and girls as a ""significant priority"", adding that chief constables were signing up to a national violence against women and girls strategy and a co-ordinator would be employed to to ensure the report's recommendations were implemented. Responding to the report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said tackling violence against women and girls was a top priority for the government. She said: ""Our VAWG Strategy, which commits to radically changing how we end abuse using a whole system approach, focuses on working with key agencies including police, healthcare and education. ""We have already taken essential action including introducing a national police lead for tackling VAWG and making Relationship Education compulsory in all primary schools."" The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said the way police responded to violence against and girls had improved in recent years, but consistency and improvements were still needed. Sophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime and joint victims' lead for the APCC, added: ""The numbers of cases closed without a suspect being charged - either because of evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support a prosecution - shows that too many victims are still being let down.""

"Nadhim Zahawi has been sacked as Conservative Party chairman for ""serious breaches"" of the ministerial code after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC over unpaid tax. Believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, Mr Zahawi made his fortune after co-founding the online polling company YouGov. The venture was a great success - but questions over the sale of shares in the company and whether this was taxed correctly prompted scrutiny of Mr Zahawi's financial affairs. Mr Zahawi said he was confident he had ""acted properly"", but an inquiry by the prime minister's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus was highly critical. Key questions about Zahawi's tax affairs PM orders investigation into Zahawi tax row Before the issue hit the headlines, the 55-year-old was often relied upon as a solid media performer for the government and has held a number of high-profile roles, including vaccines minister and education secretary, as well as chancellor. Despite his rapid rise in politics, leading one of the great offices of state might have been unthinkable for Mr Zahawi as a child. ""I must be one of the luckiest human beings on earth,"" the Stratford-upon-Avon MP said reflecting on his early years. Born in Iraq in 1967 he could easily have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War. ""I would have been drafted in to the Iraqi army, had to go to front line and probably die,"" hetold Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcastlast year. Instead, he and his parents were forced to flee Iraq and he grew up in Britain. His family had been influential in the country - his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq and his signature appeared on the country's banknotes. However, when Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s, they came under threat. Mr Zahawi's father, a businessman, got a tip-off that the authorities were coming for him and quickly arranged to fly out. His son has recalled the anxiety of watching the plane preparing to take off from Baghdad Airport. After all the passengers had boarded, a military vehicle drove up to the plane. His mother was in tears as they saw a passenger being removed. The passenger turned out not to be his father, but the man who had been sitting behind him on the aircraft. Mr Zahawi described it as a ""traumatic"" childhood moment ""stamped on his memory"". So instead of growing up in Iraq, Mr Zahawi grew up in Sussex. He was educated at private and comprehensive schools and became a keen equestrian. The children's TV show Teletubbies provided the young Nadhim Zahawi with one of his early business ventures But, as he was heading to university another disaster struck the family. A business venture of his father's fell through, and he, in Mr Zahawi's words, ""lost everything"" except a brown Vauxhall car. The young Nadhim Zahawi decided he would use the Vauxhall to become a minicab driver in order to help put food on the table. However, his mother insisted on her son going to university and pawned her jewellery so he wouldn't have to worry about the finances. After studying chemical engineering at University College London, he followed in his father's entrepreneurial footsteps and set up a firm selling Teletubbies merchandise - a company which attracted investment from the then-Conservative politician Jeffrey Archer. Speaking to the BBC's Profile programme,Lord Archer remembered the young Nadhim Zahawi as ""a born organiser"". ""If you said, 'I need six taxis, three aeroplanes and a double decker bus, all in 30 minutes', he went and did it,"" he said. Jeffrey Archer introduced Mr Zahawi to key Conservative figures Through Lord Archer's parties, Mr Zahawi met influential Conservative figures including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In 1994 he became a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, south London and three years later unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in Erith and Thamesmead. When Lord Archer launched his campaign to become London mayor, Mr Zahawi joined his team. But the candidate was forced to pull out of the race, and Mr Zahawi had to look for alternative work. In 2000 he founded YouGov, along with another ex-member of team Archer - Stephan Shakespeare. Ten years later, after it had become a hugely successful global company, Mr Zahawi stood down from YouGov to run for Parliament. In 2010 he was successful, winning the safe Conservative seat of Stratford-Upon-Avon. The Warwickshire constituency of Stratford-Upon-Avon has been held by the Conservatives for over 100 years Parliament was still reeling from the MPs expenses scandal, and Mr Zahawi soon becameembroiled in his own transgressionwhen it emerged he had claimed expenses to supply his stables with electricity. He said he was ""mortified by this mistake"" and paid back the money. It didn't hinder his political progress too much and in January 2018 then-PM Theresa May made him an education minister. However, Mr Zahawi again found himself in trouble, this time for attending a gala held by the men-only Presidents Club. Anundercover reporter for the Financial Times had revealed,externalthe hostesses had been subjected to groping and lewd comments. Mr Zahawi said the event made him ""extremely uncomfortable"" and he left early. Nevertheless, his attendance at the event earned him a reprimand from Downing Street. Mr Zahawi remained a minister when Boris Johnson came to power in July 2019, moving from the education to the business department. Then in November 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, he was handed what he has called ""the most important job I'll ever do"" - the position of vaccines minister. For almost 11 months he oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme, and was able to boast a fair amount of success, especially when the UK raced ahead of many other countries. Seen as a ""safe pair of hands"", he came to the education secretary role following the sacking of Gavin Williamson, who was unpopular with the public after the exams fiasco during the pandemic. As the country's new man in charge of education he faced the unprecedented challenge of ensuring a whole generation of children caught up after having missed months of school as a result of the pandemic. When Rishi Sunak dramatically quit as chancellor in July 2022, Mr Zahawi was given the role - one of the most important positions in the government. Mr Zahawi had been loyal to Mr Johnson, frequently defending him in media interviews. However, after days of turmoil and mass ministerial resignations, he called on Mr Johnson to leave. A few hours later Mr Johnson had announced his resignation. Liz Truss replaced him as prime minister and made Mr Zahawi minister for equalities and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He wasn't in the job for long. When Rishi Sunak took over as PM in October he moved Mr Zahawi to Conservative Party chairman and minister without portfolio, attending cabinet as part of his role. Media reports about his tax affairs first emerged when he was appointed chancellor last July. But further revelations this month piled pressure on Mr Zahawi. Now, after Mr Sunak asked his independent ethics adviser to investigate, he is no longer party chairman.

"A PM is rarely as powerful as on a reshuffle day ""This is a mad way to run the country,"" confessed a member of the government. Whether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce. Bravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, ""I think I'm OK,"" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked. And farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. Johnson rings changes with major cabinet reshuffle Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Removing the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan. But even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. There are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now. He's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small. Anne-Marie Trevelyan is back on the top team In a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. There are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear. What's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded. But it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a ""one-nation"" cabinet for those more in the middle. It's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for. For Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face.

"Michael Gove's reputation as a reformer precedes him Love him or loathe him, Michael Gove has a reputation in government as a man who gets things done. Often described as a ""reformer"",  he's been given a pretty hefty brief in Boris Johnson's latest cabinet reshuffle - running the department for housing, communities and local government with added responsibility for ""levelling up"" the UK and defending the union. While some have called it a sideways move, for others it's a clear sign of the prime minister's faith in his one-time adversary turned ally. Boris Johnson has put him in charge of delivering what was a key election promise - addressing regional inequalities and improving people's prospects regardless of where they live. That is no easy task. The ""levelling up"" agenda has been criticised for being too vague, lacking in definition or strategy and failing to set out how success might be measured. Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger What is levelling up and how is it going? Levelling up at risk of failure - ex-No 10 adviser The town debating how to 'level up' Earlier this year, Conservative MP Neil O'Brien was appointed as an adviser to give the idea direction, and I understand he's been working internally to try to bring coherence to a concept that spans several departments, with a white paper expected this autumn. Now he's been given a ministerial role working alongside Michael Gove, who it seems, has been brought in to boost its profile, give it political clout and put some meat on the bones - I'm told he's been 'itching' to get his hands on a department which allows him to get stuck into operational policy. As Will Tanner, director of the Onward think-tank and former No 10 advisor put it, he is a '""heavy hitter"" who is now in charge of a department that will be the ""engine"" for the levelling-up agenda. Protecting the Green Belt is a top priority in Surrey But there are nerves among Tory councillors, who will inevitably be working closely with the new secretary of state. I understand the leaders of some of the largest Conservative-run councils were on a call on Thursday morning discussing what his appointment might mean, and there was a distinct sense of uncertainty. Michael Gove's radical ideas have not always proved popular. During his tenure as education secretary he incurred the wrath of many, with controversial reforms that have left him with a toxic reputation among plenty within a sector which he famouslybranded ""the Blob"". His new brief has got some tricky sticking points, not least the government's highly controversial planning reforms. The government announced on Friday it was ""pausing"" the changes, so that Mr Gove could take stock of concerns. There are some Conservatives who hope that as a Surrey MP Michael Gove will be particularly alive to the political tension around planning. The prospect of what critics see as overdevelopment in Surrey was largely blamed for Tory losses at the local elections in May. But while the government is widely thought to have softened its stance on some of the most controversial aspect of its proposals, Boris Johnson is committed to building more homes. It's seen as a key element of ""levelling up"" - and some in the Conservative Party wonder whether Mr Gove has been given his new job to drive development. As one Tory MP put it, Mr Gove will be ""formidable in that post"", adding: ""We can't tell whether he's been appointed to build any and everywhere regardless of the opposition, or whether he's been appointed to deliver some sort of compromise."" Mr Gove will also have to work with Labour-controlled councils. On hearing the news of Michael Gove's appointment, I'm told jokes about his past speeches - andnightclub dance moves,external- started doing the rounds among Labour councillors. There is real concern, though, that he will introduce radical reform and ride roughshod over opposition. One Labour councillor referred to his ""bad reputation"", saying: ""The fear is he'll fly in, make his mark, and fly out like he did in education."" Some in Labour do privately feel Mr Gove might boost the profile of local government, which has often felt overlooked - particularly in the debate over social care - but few believe his arrival will solve what they see as an unfair funding system. One said the government was ""highly political"" when it came to funding, and though it ""can't get much worse"" they didn't hold out much hope of it getting better. I'm told Mr Gove has already responded to backbench Conservative MPs who are concerned about planning reforms, which suggests he's willing to engage, though few yet know his thinking. And while Mr Gove's supporters say he's a man of action, his critics point to a past willingness to override opposition to achieve his desired outcome. That's proving a worry for some, given the contentious issues now under his charge - the long-running problem of shortfalls in council funding, the creaking social care system and the prospect of local government reorganisation to name a few. Tim Oliver, the Conservative leader of Surrey County Council and chairman of the County Councils Network, said Mr Gove would be an advocate for local government, but suggested he would want reform. ""He (Mr Gove) understands local government,"" he said. ""But he will expect us to look at ways we can streamline services and perhaps deliver savings. I don't think he's going to be somebody who's going to provide large bailouts."" Most agree the new secretary of state won't be content to simply oversee a department without implementing change. For some that's an exciting prospect, for others the cause of nervous anticipation.
