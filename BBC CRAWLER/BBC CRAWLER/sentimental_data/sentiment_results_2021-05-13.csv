"This video can not be played David Cameron was challenged over his lobbying for Greensill David Cameron has said he was paid ""far more"" as a part-time adviser to now-collapsed Greensill Capital than when he was prime minister. He told MPs he had had a ""big economic investment"" in the finance company, including shares. But he insisted he was not motivated by money when he lobbied ministers on behalf of the firm - and he believed he had acted in the national interest. Mr Cameron was paid Â£150,402 a year when he quit as prime minister in 2016. Speaking via video link to the Treasury Select Committee, he repeatedly declined to reveal his exact salary at Greensill, which he joined two years after leaving Downing Street, calling it a ""private matter"". The panel of MPs is among three parliamentary committees that have launched inquiries into the company, following its collapse in March. As it happened: Cameron grilled by MPs Gupta empire facing UK fraud probe over Greensill What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Cameron told the Treasury Committee he had not broken any rules when he tried to influence ministers and officials on behalf of Greensill Capital around the start of the Covid pandemic in spring last year. He said it had been ""appropriate"" for him to call and text ministers and officials directly, as financial schemes were being designed quickly at a ""time of extraordinary crisis"". But he conceded that in future ""prime ministers should only ever use letter or email, and should restrict themselves far more"". And he backed a tightening up of the rules for ministers and officials who take jobs in industry. Mr Cameronhas previously saidhe began working as a ""part-time senior adviser"" to Greensill Capital in August 2018. ""I was paid an annual amount, a generous annual amount, far more than what I earned as prime minister, and I had shares - not share options but shares in the business - which vested over the period of time of my contract,"" he told the committee. He described reports he had been set to make Â£60m from Greensill before its collapse as ""completely absurd"". Mr Cameron also said the demise of Greensill Capital was a ""great regret"" to him, and there were ""important lessons to be learned"" from it. He added that he had conducted ""quite a lot of due diligence"" before taking up the advisory role, including asking questions about ""every aspect of the business"". What is lobbying? It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists ""I had a big economic investment in the future of Greensill, so I wanted the business to succeed,"" Mr Cameron told MPs. ""I wanted it to grow."" He said his economic interest in the firm had been ""important"" but was not relevant to the MPs' inquiry into its collapse and its contacts with government. And he said he had felt the firm's proposals would help small businesses access cash during an economic crisis, and were ""absolutely in the public interest"". In a separate hearing, with the the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Cameron said he had only learned that Greensill Capital was in financial difficulty towards the end of last year. He added that the past few months, during which his work for the company has come in for widespread criticism, had been ""very difficult"", but said he felt more sorry for the hundreds of staff who had lost their jobs. The former prime minister repeatedly texted ministers and officials, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, asking for the firm to be included in a Covid-related government loan scheme. But his attempts to involve Greensill in the Covid Corporate Financing Facility were ultimately unsuccessful after they were rebuffed by the Treasury.

"Pupils have lost months of education due to Covid Some Â£13.5bn is needed to reverse the damage to pupils' education caused by the pandemic, a think tank has said. The Education Policy Institute says the money is needed as pupils have lost up to two months of learning in reading, and up to three months in maths. It is calling on the government to extend the school day and increase funding for poor pupils, as part of a series of measures to help recovery. The government has already given Â£1.7bn for catch-up support in England. This week, the Prime Minister promised to address the learning pupils have missed during the pandemic, and ensure every child is able to fulfil their potential. The report points out this will require significant investment. It says the government will need to put in place an ambitious programme of support to run over a number of years, to help pupils who have lost months of education since schools were first closed in March 2020. The report calculates the total cost to help pupils catch up is Â£13.5bn over three years, which compares with the annual schools budget for England of Â£48bn. Five ways children could make up for lost school time Parents worry about lost learning as schools reopen Lost school time 'may cost pupils Â£40,000' In total, it is estimated the lost learning could result in total lost lifetime earnings of between Â£62bn and Â£420bn, across the eight million school children in England. The researchers argue that extra support should be kept in place for a number of years to address the inequalities in education that existed before the pandemic, and to improve the results of pupils. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) research shows that even before Covid, poorer pupils were already 18 months of learning behind their more affluent classmates by the time they took their GCSEs - with that attainment gap already starting to widen. The impact of school closures meant that by autumn 2020, pupils had lost up to two months in reading overall, and up to three months in maths in primary schools. But following school closures before Christmas and in early 2021, losses are likely to have increased further, the report suggests. To make up for the loss of so much time in school, the report recommends a number of measures that should be part of the recovery plans the government is working on. These include longer school days, so that children can take part in a range of education, sports and social activities. Other suggestions include summer activities to help well-being, more one-to-one and small group tuition, extra funding for pupils from poorer families and mental health support. The recovery should also include support for younger children in the early years, where high-quality education and care can play a decisive role. And much more funding is needed for 16 to 19-year-olds in further education colleges and those studying apprenticeships, the researchers recommend. Natalie Perera, chief executive of the EPI, says if the government is committed to dealing with the harmful and long-term consequences of Covid, then it needs to provide a serious funding boost. ""We are calling on the government to implement a series of effective, evidence-based policies from this September to support children and young people - not only with their learning, but with their well-being and mental health too."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government's response has been utterly insufficient. ""The government must prioritise education in the forthcoming Spending Review so that schools can increase the number of properly qualified teachers on staff, and bring down our historically high class-sizes. The solution to Covid cannot be yet more austerity."" A government spokesman highlighted its initial Â£1.7bn investment in a catch-up plan for pupils, adding: ""We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic as quickly and comprehensively as possible - and we have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner to advise on this work.""

"This video can not be played Family who found fragments of Winchcombe meteorite visit Natural History Museum display From Monday, you'll get a chance to see the most famous space rock in Britain. The meteorite that fell on the Gloucestershire town of Winchcombe in February is going on public display at London's Natural History Museum. Scientists are busy studying the rock because it holds within it chemistry that existed at the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. But they've got enough material to enable a 100g chunk to also be shown off to museum visitors. To the uninitiated, the display meteorite looks like a small piece of half-burnt coal. Lean in close, though, and you can see some strands of grass and even some mud. This is something that fell out of the sky into a field. Winchcombe meteorite is first UK find in 30 years A fireball, a driveway and a priceless meteorite Antarctic meteorites yield global bombardment rate This video can not be played Dr Helena Bates: ""We hope this will reinvigorate meteorite science in the UK"" Victoria Bond, whose land that was and who's donated the rock fragment to the museum, is still surprised by the discovery. She'd given permission for scientists to come on to her farm to perform a systematic sweep, but doubted anything would be found among all the sheep faeces that covered the ground. ""They were moving like zombies, pacing back and forth in a line, looking for the meteorite,"" she recalls. ""And as I left that morning in my car, I could see them jumping for joy. ""How they found it is amazing. I'm thinking of putting a plaque in the field because the footpath, the Cotswold Way, is no more than 100 yards away."" The thrill of it: It's difficult to overstate the importance of this find From the many videos of the incoming fireball that were recorded that Sunday night, and also from the thousands of eyewitness accounts, researchers had been able to correctly identify where in England rocky debris might come down. And the subsequent searches turned up trumps. It was Mira Ihasz in a University of Glasgow-led sweep of the Bond land that spotted something precious among the sheep poo. That discovery may have been the single biggest chunk recovered in the Winchcombe area, but the museum has many more pieces now in its collection - roughly 500g. They are kept in a special box to keep them dry. Each piece is in a little bag. Lumps larger than a pea are wrapped in foil first. Much of the material comes from the driveway of the Wilcock family. Their home was in the crosshairs of the fireball. Rob, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah had carefully picked up some of the debris that went splat on the tarmac. Museum scientists then came in to sweep up the remaining dust using a toothbrush and an empty cottage cheese pot. This video can not be played Dr Ashley King: ""Winchcombe takes us back to 'year zero' for the Solar System"" Believe it or not, those plastic ephemera are now part of the national collection, too. As will be a square of the dented Wilcock driveway when it's dug up. These artefacts are all part of the story and will eventually join the Bond fragment on display. ""It's fabulous to see the Winchcombe meteorite finally on show. It's so beautiful,"" says Cathryn. ""It's mind-blowing,"" adds Hannah. There's some crazy money being offered online right now by privateer collectors seeking to buy or sell Winchcombe space rock. But Rob says the family never thought of selling their share: ""We wanted the meteorite (to go to the museum) to inspire young people to get into science and do lots of good work. We owe a lot to scientists at the moment and I think we should inspire the next generation."" Delicate rock: The Bond fragment broke in two when it was picked up Dr Helena Bates, the interim curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, certainly hopes that will be the case. ""This is the first meteorite to be observed to fall and then be recovered in the UK for 30 years,"" she tells BBC News. ""But the other thing is, we have not had a carbonaceous chondrite ever fall in the UK. Carbonaceous chondrites are really, really special, because they are basically some of the oldest, most pristine material we could possibly get to look at. ""They're like time capsules from the beginning of the Solar System. That piece of rock that fell in Gloucestershire has a 4.567-billion-year history."" A section of the Wilcock driveway will be dug up for display Scientists in the UK and abroad are subjecting the meteorite pieces to a battery of tests. You might think that 500g - the weight of half a bag of sugar - represents an inadequate supply for all the researchers who want to examine it. But it's actually ample. Space missions sent to retrieve similar rock from asteroids would be thrilled to grab as much. The museum's Dr Ashley King is bombarding a tiny bit with X-rays to reveal its mineral make-up. ""Each kind of mineral has its own characteristic X-ray pattern. It's like a fingerprint,"" he says. ""When the Solar System was forming, there was this huge cloud of gas and dust with the Sun at the centre, and then everything started accreting together to make bigger bodies, like the asteroids and the comets and eventually the planets. This meteorite tells us what minerals were present back then."" The Wilcock family: It's all about the science The scientists know enough already about Winchcombe to make a submission to the international body that classifies meteorites. It's very probably what's referred to as a CM carbonaceous chondrite. CMs are highly prized because they contain abundant organic, or carbon-rich, molecules. This, obviously, is chemistry that fascinates researchers because it lies at the basis of life. We don't have traces of biological activity on Earth until almost a billion years after the Solar System's formation, but studying meteorites like Winchcombe could give us clues as to how life got going on our planet. That's an amazing thought as you gaze at the 100g block in the museum's glazed display-case. The Natural History Museum reopens to the public on Monday after its enforced Covid closure. To get in, visitors must book a free timed ticket in advance online at themuseum's website,external.

"Mahmood used police cars to try to stop drugs couriers and ""seize"" their money A Metropolitan Police officer who pretended to stop and search drug dealers so he could steal their money has been jailed for eight years. Kashif Mahmood seized hundreds of thousands of pounds for an organised crime gang controlled from Dubai. The gang received information about when money was on the move so that Mahmood could intercept it - in uniform - using police cars. Four other men and a woman received sentences of up to 16 years. The sentences follow an investigation which benefited from the penetration of the Encrochat mobile phone network in 2020. Clockwise from top L: Shazad Khan, Shabaz Khan, Moshin Khan, Ioan Gherghel and Maria Shah - all had entered guilty pleas Passing sentence, His Honour Judge Tomlinson said Kashif Mahmood had abused his position of ""power, trust and responsibility"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the case ""shocking"" but said she was ""delighted"" the Met's anti corruption officers ""were able to mount this operation and to catch those people and to actually have a big impact on an organised criminal network"". Of corrupt officers, Dame Cressida added: ""They betray the rest of us and we deplore this form of corruption or any corruption."" Mahmood was a police officer for 10 years, receiving a string of commendations before being dismissed in November The defendants pleaded guilty to offences including acquiring criminal property, money laundering and drug supply. It was a sophisticated criminal operation based on tip-offs from a shadowy figure in Dubai, named in court as Mutjaba Neazmand. Using the code name ""SSNew"" on the Encrochat network, the court heard he was involved in large-scale drug dealing, but also directing gang members to ""steal back"" the proceeds. Neazmand would contact the gang's leader in the UK, Mohsin Khan, with information about ""jobs"" - large amounts of money being carried by drug couriers. Khan, whose Encrochat nickname was ""AcquaPlus"" would pass on the details to police officer Kashif Mahmood, who had served in the Met for 10 years. Mahmood would book out police cars from Stoke Newington Police station, and pick up an accomplice, Ioan Gherghel, to pose as his partner. The police seized 20kg of cannabis at the home of one of Khan brothers Backed up by Khan and his two brothers, they would then try to stop the couriers and ""seize"" their money. Often the couriers had been given the cash by the Khan gang as part of a drug deal. When it was stolen back by the Khans and Mahmood, they were left out of pocket, and at risk of reprisals from their criminal associates. The scam was so successful the gang seized more than a million pounds, prosecutors believe. By March 2020 ""SSNew"" or Neazmand, the mastermind in Dubai, was boasting in Encrochat messages that: ""We can do 1500m and I still say to u bro we do more."" ""This system is in our hand. We can do it unlimited."" Police say Encrochat was almost exclusively used by criminals who communicated freely, believing their conversations were encrypted. It was penetrated by French police and intelligence agency cyber security experts in early 2020, and, as a result, more than 1,500 suspects have been arrested so far. The Khan gang were caught following a number of ""jobs"", including one where they inadvertently targeted a drug courier, while he was under police surveillance. Prosecutors believe the gang had handed him half a million pounds, in return for drugs. Mahmood and Gherghel, also dressed as police officers, then stopped the man's car in Chingford, East London, searched it, and took the money back. This meant that the gang now had both the cash and the drugs. But surveillance officers belonging to a police proactive money laundering team were, by chance, watching what happened. They stopped Mahmood to find out why the search of the target's car had been carried out, and requested he create an intelligence report. Mahmood's body worn video camera was inadvertently triggered and captured pictures of Gherghel, dressed as a police officer and sitting in the police car with him  A still from Mahmood's bodycam which was accidentally triggered during the Chingford stop and search Prosecutors said Mahmood was forced to go to his police station, despite being signed off on sick leave to complete the report. It was used by police as evidence against him. They also analysed extensive mobile phone evidence to build up a picture of the gang's communications and movements. Following arrests, large amounts of cash were found in the conspirators' homes. Cash seized at an address shared by Maria Shah, Moshin Khan and Shazad Khan Maria Shah, a partner of one of the gang, and also convicted of being involved, is believed to have withdrawn a large amount of cash from a safety deposit box facility in Knightsbridge, central London. When police searched the boxes they were found to be empty. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which worked to ensure the investigation was thorough and impartial, called Mahmood's behaviour ""audacious corrupt and criminal"". ""His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing,"" said the IOPC's director of major investigations, Steve Noonan. ""While all the evidence we have seen points towards this being an isolated case of police corruption... we have to remain vigilant and will continue to pursue allegations of corruption vigorously.""

"Howard Beckett is standing to be the next Unite general secretary The home secretary's immigration policies are ""disgusting"", union official Howard Beckett has said following his suspension from Labour. The suspension came after the Unite assistant general secretary tweeted that Priti Patel ""should be deported"". Mr Beckett later apologised to Ms Patel and deleted the post. But he told Sky News his suspension was ""completely inappropriate"" and insisted he would not pull out of the race to lead Unite. He added that he had not received any notice of his suspension from Labour, but had found out about the move on social media. He also said Labour was becoming ""the party of the establishment"" and accused party leader Sir Keir Starmer of failing to ""show leadership"". Unite contest: Who's running and what's at stake? Unite to elect new leader by end of summer While suspended from the party Mr Beckett is not allowed to take up his place on Labour's ruling body. He sits as a union representative on Labour's National Executive Committee - a role that requires membership of the party. Mr Beckett is a candidate in the race to succeed longstanding leader Len McCluskey at Unite, one of Labour's biggest financial backers. His tweet was a response to the Home Officedetaining two Indian immigrantsin Glasgow on Thursday over ""suspected immigration offences"". The Home Office defended its actions, saying: ""The UK government is tackling illegal immigration and the harm it causes, often to the most vulnerable people by removing those with no right to be in the UK."" In his now-deleted twitter message, Mr Beckett wrote: ""Priti Patel should be deported, not refugees. She can go along with anyone else who supports institutional racism. She is disgusting."" In a later apology posted on Twitter, he said: ""My earlier tweet, deleted after half an hour, was never intended to be literal."" ""My intention was to emphasise that racist policies should be rejected and have no place in society,"" he added. ""The wording was wrong, offensive and I apologise unreservedly to Priti Patel. No-one should be deported."" Speaking to Sky News, he said his language had been ""inappropriate"" adding: ""I don't look at Priti Patel and see her migrant background and colour of her skin, I look at Priti Patel and I see a racist agenda, the racist policies that are being carried out, the institutional racism that is now becoming the norm in society."" He added: ""I don't have a racist bone in my body."" A Labour spokesperson had earlier said it was taking the matter ""extremely seriously"" and pledged ""appropriate action will be taken"". Conservative MP Steve Baker said it was ""an extraordinary, absolutely intolerable remark"" which must have a ""robust response"" from Labour. The BBC has contacted Unite for a comment.

"Portugal has yet to decide whether it will allow visits from UK holidaymakers as it extends its ""state of calamity"" until 30 May. From 17 May, travellers from England and Scotland won't have to quarantine upon their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries. But those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. However, some football fans may be able to go to the planned UEFA Champions League final in Porto on 29 May. Portugal's government has announced that it is extending its ""state of public calamity"" on the mainland - the second highest level of alert - for a further 15 days from Monday, until 30 May. Under current plans, people from England and Scotland will be allowed to travel to Portugal for non-essential reasons from Monday. But whether they will be allowed in by Portugal has not been decided yet by the Portuguese government, said cabinet office minister Mariana Vieira da Silva. On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale Which countries are on the green list for foreign holidays? Covid: Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list ""I have no information to give yet,"" she said at a briefing when asked whether the UK restrictions would soon be lifted. ""Work is going on and as soon as there is a decision it will be announced, but no decision was taken in this cabinet meeting,"" she said. Travellers from the UK are one of the biggest markets for Portugal's tourism sector, along with those from Spain and France. Ms Vieira da Silva did not say when a decision on the matter might be taken. At present, Portugalallows flights to and from the UK,external, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Firms including Tui and Easyjet have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerdue to Covid uncertainty. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. The UEFA Champions League final in Porto has not yet been officially announced, but is widely expected after Portugal's government agreed to allow a limited number of fans to attend, despite this not yet being the case at domestic games. Ms Vieira da Silva said that a series of restrictions would apply. There will be a 12,000 limit on numbers and tickets will be for named people in designated seats, which will spaced in line with health guidelines. Fans will have to fly in on charters, arriving and leaving ""on the same day"" in what Ms Vieira da Silva described as ""a bubble situation"" - passing through a separate zone at the airport, as well as having to take a coronavirus test before travelling.

"The NHS is sending a mobile vaccine bus into parts of Bolton with high infections Second vaccine doses could be brought forward and local restrictions introduced to help tackle the Indian variant in the worst-affected areas, the UK  government has said. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said steps could also include vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households. Meanwhile, a top scientist has warned lifting restrictions on 21 June is in doubt because of the Indian variant. Cases in the UK have more than doubled to 1,313, Public Health England said. The figures released on Thursday have risen from520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May,external. Most of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE. However, Prof Paul Hunter, who sits on a number of Covid advisory committees for the World Health Organization, said current figures were around two weeks out of date and would now be higher. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Indian variant was now in most regions of the UK, with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Humber and north-east England. More than 30% of cases are in London, followed by 25% in north-west England, 12% in eastern England, 10% in the East Midlands and 8% in the South East, PHE said. Four people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May, according to PHE. According to Friday's government figures, a further 17 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,193 coronavirus cases have been recorded. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Why is the Indian variant causing concern in the UK? What is the Indian Covid variant? Do India reinfections pose a challenge to vaccines? The Department of Health and Social Care said there was ""no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine"". But experts believe it may be more transmissible. And the department said ministers could not rule out imposing local restrictions if they were necessary to suppress a variant which vaccines are less effective against. Vaccines Minister Mr Zahawi said the government was also considering reducing the gap between vaccine doses for people in areas where the variant is spreading. He added that pilots of vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households in Luton had been successful. Prof Hunter said there was ""possibly"" a case for targeting vaccines in certain areas - but jabs took two to three weeks to work. This would mean diverting doses from other areas, where the Indian variant could also soon be spreading. He added that he thought it was more important to administer as many first doses as possible than boost the number of second doses at this stage. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead. The next major easing of restrictions is due to take place on 17 May. But Prof Hunter said step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, which is due on 21 June and would see all legal limits on social contact lifted, ""is in doubt"". Currently, he said the Indian variant was spreading in younger, unvaccinated people but if cases increased in the elderly so would hospital admissions, putting pressure on the NHS. Mr Zahawi said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on the government'sfour tests,externalbeing met - including that vaccines continue to be effective and the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants. Why could the Indian variant be a problem when the vaccination programme is doing so well? The issue is that we are only part way through even though those most at risk have been prioritised. There is still debate about how transmissible the new variant is. But modelling by the University of Warwick has estimated that a 30%-40% more transmissible variant combined with relaxing restrictions in May and June could lead to more hospital admissions than in the first wave. It would be a very different situation if we were in the autumn when overall levels of immunity would be making it harder for the virus to spread. Instead, we are in the delicate phase where restrictions are being eased as the vaccine is taking over the burden of suppressing the virus. One option being considered is closing the gap between the first and second doses. This would give vulnerable people, who have already been offered their first jab, extra protection more quickly. However, there could be a trade-off as studies suggest the current 12-week gap between doses leads to a better immune response than the originally planned three-week gap. Asked whether local lockdowns were being considered, Mr Zahawi said nothing was ""off the table"", including further regional or national measures. However, he said surge testing was the ""most effective way"" of dealing with variants. Surge testing is already taking place in 15 areas across England, includingBolton,Blackburn, London,SeftonandNottingham. This is when increased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in specific locations to try to prevent the spread of outbreaks. Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Breakfast local lockdowns ""can't be the answer"" and urged ministers to deliver more vaccines to areas where case rates are highest. The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also appealed to the government not to enforce a local lockdown, saying people would simply travel to pubs and restaurants in neighbouring areas. He said he had also asked the health secretary for more resources and vaccines, including for younger people, to tackle the surge. Mr Greenhalgh said talks on the introduction of vaccines for younger age groups had been ""very constructive"" and ""all the soundings"" were that the government was looking to progress this as soon as possible. PHE said mobile testing units had been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid. More doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible. Extra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines. But the area's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison,said he was ""furious"" the government had refused a request to extend vaccinations in Blackburn. On Thursday, the council initially said all over-18s would be offered a jab, before later stating only those with underlying conditions could book an appointment. Meanwhile, the R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen slightly from between 0.8 and 1.0 to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. If the R number is above one then the number of cases keeps increasing. Additional reporting by Hazel Shearing LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford gives his first Covid update since the election People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back. But despite adopting thetraffic-light systemused in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad. The first minister warned it was ""best avoided"" because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them. Meanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because ofthe Indian variant. Plans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. Ministers had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had ""decided to hold back"" for more advice. He told the BBC he had been considering allowing ""some small events"" and ""greater mixing between people not in a household"". Both are now on hold. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? No new deaths with Covid-19 reported in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Experts are concerned the variant has mutationsthat may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective. A total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a ""variant of concern"". A total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK. Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedon Friday eveningthe wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant. The change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]. ""Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage."" Most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from airports like Bristol, the first minister said People in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad ina small number of so-called ""green"" countries,external- including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return. Wales will be adopting the same ""traffic light"" system, with countries classified as green, amber and red. It means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return. Mandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return. Everyone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return. How will the rules work? Portugal to allow UK tourists from Monday However, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes. Mr Drakeford said: ""This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided."" He admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be ""unenforceable"". He urged caution against ""importing"" coronavirus from other parts of the world. ""We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,"" he said. Mr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to ""make people feel guilty"" about going abroad, but urged people to ""think of their own safety and the safety of others"", adding there were ""fantastic opportunities"" to take a holiday in Wales instead. NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week From 24 May, a ""paper-based vaccination status"" will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. A UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons. Pubs will open indoors for the first time since last December Mr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covidalert level two,externalfrom Monday, meaning: Pubs and restaurants can reopen indoors for groups of six people from up to six different households Holiday accommodation can fully reopen Cinemas, theatres bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor play centres and areas, casinos and amusement arcade can reopen Up to 30 people can take part in indoor activities, and up to 50 in organised outdoor activities From 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased. Mr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move toalert level one,external. But he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant. This move would include ""looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events"". Pub owner Ellen Morris says it will be hard for the hospitality trade to police the new rules Ellen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet. ""They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups."" Mr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall. DJ Stacey Alford is frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England DJ Stacey Alford, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, has been receiving support from the UK government's freelancers' fund and Universal Credit. She said she had been ""extremely cautious"" and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England. ""My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that."" Wedding planner Gail Windley says weddings of 30 people are still too small for most people The relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place. Gail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing. Charmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was ""ready"" to open but said being limited to 30 people was ""not sustainable"". Mark Drakeford said foreign travel was best avoided Welsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government ""should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities"". ""It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. ""What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard. ""It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time"". Mr Price said the sector still needed further financial support: ""What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?"". The 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are ""almost entirely the result of international travel"", the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said those infected were ""people coming back to Wales from overseas"" and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams. ""All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,"" he said. ""And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment."" Dr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales ""we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point"". Public Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were ""due to the risk of small number identification"". Dr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation.

"Eluned Morgan and Jeremy Miles are rewarded with promotions within the cabinet Eluned Morgan has been named health minister with Jeremy Miles at education in a Welsh government reshuffle. In a surprise move, Vaughan Gething moves from health to economy, replacing Ken Skates who leaves the government. Mark Drakeford was sworn in as first minister earlier, after Senedd members backed him to continue in the role on Wednesday. Labour won 30 of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament in last week's election. Both Mr Gething and Mr Skates had been in their previous posts for five years. Mr Gething had a particularly high profile as health minister during the pandemic, in leading the response to the coronavirus crisis alongside Mr Drakeford and the chief medical officer. Vaughan Gething visited an NHS depot collecting supplies for India in one of his last acts as health minister on Monday Announcing the changes, the first minister paid tribute to Mr Skates, who he said would ""continue speaking up for north Wales and for Welsh Labour, but in a different role"". ""We will miss his energy and passion,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said Mr Gething's efforts during the pandemic had been ""extraordinary"" but he felt it was time ""to ask someone else to take on that challenge"". The former health minister, he said, was taking over the economy job ""at a crucial point in time - the pandemic is not just a public health emergency but also an economic one"". Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said there had been ""rumours for a while that Vaughan Gething wanted to move from the health portfolio"". ""He's been in position there for five years and was a deputy before that, and that's quite a long stint really, in a very difficult role and not least, of course, during a pandemic, so I can see the logic to that,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. Prof McAllister said his replacement, Eluned Morgan, as health minister had a ""very effective time during the pandemic in terms of fronting up on government policy, sometimes at very difficult times"", and she was being rewarded for that. Mark Drakeford (centre) assembles his new team at the Welsh government offices in Cardiff The new cabinet was expected to meet on Thursday evening to finalise Friday's Covid lockdown restrictions review. Julie James has been appointed to a new cabinet role as minister for climate change, with Lee Waters as her deputy. Mr Drakeford said: ""The environment will be at the heart of our decision-making. ""The climate change emergency has not gone away while we have been dealing with the pandemic. ""Wales is a beautiful country with immense natural assets, which will help power our recovery and create the jobs of the future. ""In my new government, the environment doesn't just have a seat at the cabinet table, it will be a consideration in all we do."" Jane Hutt moves from chief whip to a newly created post of minister for social justice. Two thirds of the new cabinet are women. Allow Twitter content?

Dawn Bowden, Member of the Senedd (MS) for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, joins the government from the backbenches as deputy minister for arts and sport and takes over Ms Hutt's former role of chief whip, responsible for ensuring discipline in the Labour ranks. Torfaen MS Lynne Neagle, a Cardiff Bay politician since 1999, also gets a government job for the first time, as deputy minister for mental health and wellbeing. In a statement marking his departure as economy minister, Mr Skates said: ""This week I informed the first minister of my wish to step away from Welsh government. After eight years in government, now is the right time."" He added: ""Clwyd South has always remained my number one priority, and my decision will enable me to spend more time in the constituency, focusing on local matters, as well as further strengthening the party's position in north Wales and further afield."" Conservative Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies said his members would ""scrutinise and hold ministers to account, but will also offer the hand of cooperation where possible to ensure Wales bounces back from the most difficult year we've experienced"". ""It's in this spirit that I want to wish the first minister and his new cabinet well as they start the significant task of ensuring our economy and public services get on the road to recovery,"" he said. Plaid Cymru South Wales West MS Sioned Williams welcomed the ""greater focus on climate change and mental health"" but urged new ministers in other portfolios to address the ""policy shortcomings and lack of delivery of their predecessors"". ""With record waiting lists, a low wage economy and one in three children living in poverty - all there before the pandemic and all on Labour's watch - we are in danger of getting the same results if ministers do the same thing over and over again,"" she said. The next Senedd term takes us through well over half of what the UK's advisers on climate change describe as a ""decisive decade"". By 2030 Wales needs to have got rid of two thirds of its greenhouse gas emissions. And if there's hope of no longer contributing to global warming by 2050, the complex rewiring required of our economy and way of life must truly get under way. It's a monumental task and these new climate change ministerial and deputy ministerial roles should be considered among the most senior and important jobs in the Welsh government. But of course every department and minister will have to work out how they too can rise to this challenge, with Wales already starting to feel the potentially disastrous effects of a changing climate.

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis had told families the PM would write to them Relatives of the Ballymurphy victims have spoken of their anger over a written apology from the prime minister. Aninquest has found10 people, who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast, were ""entirely innocent"". Families received the letter from Boris Johnson on Thursday morning. John Teggart, whose father Daniel was among the victims, said the tone and timing of the apology was unacceptable. He said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for ""the events at Ballymurphy"" in 1971. John Teggart (centre) made a statement on behalf of the families on Thursday afternoon In a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: ""The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger."" He added: ""It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. ""We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing."" Mr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. ""The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable. ""We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved."" Mr Teggart said the next step was to make ""somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones"". Janet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson ""didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself"". ""If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself."" Carmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words ""the events"" to describe what happened. Carmel Quinn, whose brother John Laverty was killed, expressed her anger at the PM's wording ""It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,"" she said. In his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government ""profoundly regrets and is truly sorry"" for what happened in Ballymurphy. He said this also extended to the families for the ""additional pain"" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled. This video can not be played 'Do this right - we want Boris Johnson at despatch box' Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like ""second class citizens"" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement. ""Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?"" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. ""Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris."" Ballymurphy: Who were the victims? 'Entirely innocent': What happened at Ballymurphy? Mr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families. He said there was ""no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles"". ""This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,"" Mr Lewis said. On Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call. However, on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call. Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during a phone call with the first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday Speaking of his subsequent letter, she added: ""A second hand apology is no apology at all."" Ms McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown ""courage, dignity, resilience and stamina"". ""I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here."" But some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public. On Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted ""to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt"" caused to the Ballymurphy families. Briege Voyle and John Teggart, whose relatives were killed in Ballymurphy, watch the NI secretary deliver his address Among the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two. Nine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. However, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr. Mr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. ""The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,"" Mr Lewis said. ""Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth."" Brandon Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened He added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was ""strong and legitimate"". ""Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,"" he said. ""We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future."" A number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. The Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister ""apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed"". Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a ""profound failure of justice"". ""In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,"" she said. ""Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not ""suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty"". The government is tobring forward legislation in the course of the next yearto deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Based on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations. Mr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that ""we get to the heart of what happened"". Amnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles. There has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed. But it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Not just future cases, but potentially, those already in train. It would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Initial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups. Sources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. The plan has been met with loud opposition. Already, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless. The legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved. But they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions. The government believes this is the key. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were ""sheer bloody murder"". ""Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?"" Mr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the ""courage and dignity"" of the families affected. ""Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?"" he asked. Denis Bradley, co-author of theConsultative Group on the Past Report,externalin 2009, said a statute of limitations was ""possibly workable"" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a ""hierarchy"" for victims. ""For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,"" he told BBC News NI's The View programme. Mr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy. On Thursday, he said the criminal justice system ""is not the place to do the past"". ""The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,"" he added. Mr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was ""information"" rather than court proceedings. PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971 Ballymurphy: Who were the victims?

"The e-fit image was created after speaking to a key witness, police said An e-fit picture has been released by police as they try to find the mother of a newborn baby boy found in a park. The infant, named George by hospital staff, was found clothed in a blanket on 22 April at The Mounds in Kings Norton, Birmingham. Police said he is healthy and doing well with foster carers but they remain worried about his mother. Despite extensive searches and a number of leads, the force said they have not been able to find her. The e-fit image, created by specialists at Thames Valley Police, was put together after speaking to a key witness, detectives said. They said they wanted to speak to the woman in the picture as part of their investigation. George was named by hospital staff, as he was found the day before St George's Day Their only concern was George's mother, to check she was OK physically and mentally, they added. Det Insp Neil Hunt said he was worried about her and needed to make sure she was safe and well. ""We've not taken the decision to issue this image lightly or to frighten you,"" he said. ""We simply want to find you so we can talk to you, check you are okay, and offer any help or support you may need.""

"The NHS is sending a mobile vaccine bus into parts of Bolton with high infections Second vaccine doses could be brought forward and local restrictions introduced to help tackle the Indian variant in the worst-affected areas, the UK  government has said. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said steps could also include vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households. Meanwhile, a top scientist has warned lifting restrictions on 21 June is in doubt because of the Indian variant. Cases in the UK have more than doubled to 1,313, Public Health England said. The figures released on Thursday have risen from520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May,external. Most of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE. However, Prof Paul Hunter, who sits on a number of Covid advisory committees for the World Health Organization, said current figures were around two weeks out of date and would now be higher. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Indian variant was now in most regions of the UK, with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Humber and north-east England. More than 30% of cases are in London, followed by 25% in north-west England, 12% in eastern England, 10% in the East Midlands and 8% in the South East, PHE said. Four people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May, according to PHE. According to Friday's government figures, a further 17 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,193 coronavirus cases have been recorded. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Why is the Indian variant causing concern in the UK? What is the Indian Covid variant? Do India reinfections pose a challenge to vaccines? The Department of Health and Social Care said there was ""no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine"". But experts believe it may be more transmissible. And the department said ministers could not rule out imposing local restrictions if they were necessary to suppress a variant which vaccines are less effective against. Vaccines Minister Mr Zahawi said the government was also considering reducing the gap between vaccine doses for people in areas where the variant is spreading. He added that pilots of vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households in Luton had been successful. Prof Hunter said there was ""possibly"" a case for targeting vaccines in certain areas - but jabs took two to three weeks to work. This would mean diverting doses from other areas, where the Indian variant could also soon be spreading. He added that he thought it was more important to administer as many first doses as possible than boost the number of second doses at this stage. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead. The next major easing of restrictions is due to take place on 17 May. But Prof Hunter said step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, which is due on 21 June and would see all legal limits on social contact lifted, ""is in doubt"". Currently, he said the Indian variant was spreading in younger, unvaccinated people but if cases increased in the elderly so would hospital admissions, putting pressure on the NHS. Mr Zahawi said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on the government'sfour tests,externalbeing met - including that vaccines continue to be effective and the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants. Why could the Indian variant be a problem when the vaccination programme is doing so well? The issue is that we are only part way through even though those most at risk have been prioritised. There is still debate about how transmissible the new variant is. But modelling by the University of Warwick has estimated that a 30%-40% more transmissible variant combined with relaxing restrictions in May and June could lead to more hospital admissions than in the first wave. It would be a very different situation if we were in the autumn when overall levels of immunity would be making it harder for the virus to spread. Instead, we are in the delicate phase where restrictions are being eased as the vaccine is taking over the burden of suppressing the virus. One option being considered is closing the gap between the first and second doses. This would give vulnerable people, who have already been offered their first jab, extra protection more quickly. However, there could be a trade-off as studies suggest the current 12-week gap between doses leads to a better immune response than the originally planned three-week gap. Asked whether local lockdowns were being considered, Mr Zahawi said nothing was ""off the table"", including further regional or national measures. However, he said surge testing was the ""most effective way"" of dealing with variants. Surge testing is already taking place in 15 areas across England, includingBolton,Blackburn, London,SeftonandNottingham. This is when increased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in specific locations to try to prevent the spread of outbreaks. Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Breakfast local lockdowns ""can't be the answer"" and urged ministers to deliver more vaccines to areas where case rates are highest. The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also appealed to the government not to enforce a local lockdown, saying people would simply travel to pubs and restaurants in neighbouring areas. He said he had also asked the health secretary for more resources and vaccines, including for younger people, to tackle the surge. Mr Greenhalgh said talks on the introduction of vaccines for younger age groups had been ""very constructive"" and ""all the soundings"" were that the government was looking to progress this as soon as possible. PHE said mobile testing units had been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid. More doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible. Extra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines. But the area's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison,said he was ""furious"" the government had refused a request to extend vaccinations in Blackburn. On Thursday, the council initially said all over-18s would be offered a jab, before later stating only those with underlying conditions could book an appointment. Meanwhile, the R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen slightly from between 0.8 and 1.0 to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. If the R number is above one then the number of cases keeps increasing. Additional reporting by Hazel Shearing LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Those who stayed in what became Israel, and their descendants, have been granted citizenship and are known as Israeli Arabs. About 80% of Israeli Arabs are Muslim, with the rest identifying as either Christian or Druze. Most identify strongly with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, with many calling themselves ""Palestinian citizens of Israel"". Israel's government says its Arab citizens have equal social and political rights, although they are exempt from compulsory military service.

"Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza have a wide variety of missiles While death, damage and suffering have been caused to both sides in the escalating hostilities between Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military, this remains a hugely asymmetric struggle. Israel is the vastly more powerful player and its air force, armed drones and intelligence-gathering systems enable it to strike targets in Gaza pretty much at will. It insists that its targeting is restricted to sites used for military purposes but the density of the Palestinian population and the fact that Hamas and Islamic Jihad facilities are located close to, and often hidden under, civilian buildings makes the avoidance of civilian casualties altogether impossible. Children terrified as locals scramble for cover Old grievances fuel new fighting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, though the weaker parties, have weapons enough with which to attack Israel. They have already tried a variety of tactics. Israeli defences shot down a drone - possibly armed - that had sought to cross into Israel from Gaza. And an Israeli military spokesman said an ""elite Hamas unit"" had attempted to infiltrate Israel through a tunnel from the southern part of the strip. The Israeli military, it seems, had advance warning of this and, according to the spokesman, was able to ""cause the tunnel to implode"". Israel says more than 1,000 rockets have been launched from Gaza since Monday night But by far and away the most significant weaponry in the Palestinians' arsenal is their wide variety of ground-to-ground missiles. Some of these (along with other systems employed like the Kornet guided anti-tank missiles used during recent days), are believed to have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula. But by far the bulk of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad arsenals come from a dynamic and relatively sophisticated manufacturing capability inside the Gaza Strip itself. Israeli and outside experts believe that Iranian know-how and assistance have played a significant role in building up this industry. Accordingly, weapons manufacturing and storage sites have been among the chief targets of the Israeli strikes. The Israeli military has carried out hundreds of strikes on Gaza in response to the rocket fire Estimating the stockpile of Hamas missiles is impossible. It certainly includes many thousands of weapons of varying ranges. Clearly the Israeli military has its own estimates that it is not willing to share. All a spokesman would say was that they believed Hamas could sustain this level of fire for ""a significant period of time"". The Palestinians are employing a variety of missiles, none of which, so far, appear to be especially new in terms of basic design. But the overall trend is for the weapons to have increased ranges and larger explosive payloads. While the names and designations of specific missiles can be a bit confusing, Hamas has a huge inventory of shorter-range systems like the Qassam (up to 10km or 6 miles) and the Quds 101 (up to about 16km); bolstered by the Grad system (up to 55km); and the Sejil 55 (up to 55km). These probably make up the bulk of its inventory and for the shortest ranges can be bolstered by mortar fire. But Hamas also operates a variety of longer-range systems like the M-75 (up to 75km); the Fajr (up to 100km); the R-160 (up to 120km); and some M-302s which have a range of up to 200km. So it is clear that Hamas has weapons that can target both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and threaten the whole coastal strip which contains the greatest density of Israel's population and critical infrastructure. Streaks of light are seen as the Iron Dome system intercepts rockets near Ashkelon early on Wednesday The Israeli military says that of the more than 1,000 or so rockets fired into Israel over the past three days, some 200 have actually fallen short in the Gaza Strip itself (perhaps an indicator of the problems of a home-grown and dispersed weapons manufacturing process). The IDF also say 90% of all missiles reaching Israel have been intercepted by their Iron Dome anti-missile system. However, at one stage the battery defending the city of Ashkelon appears to have been off-line due to a technical malfunction, underlining that for all its remarkable technical success, this is not a missile-proof screen. To counter missile fire you only really have a limited number of options. You can employ anti-missile defences. You can target stockpiles and manufacturing facilities. You could in theory also mount a ground operation to push the missile-launchers back beyond effective range. That is not going to be possible in this case. Part of the Palestinians' vulnerability is that they have no strategic depth and nowhere to go. A ground operation to stifle the missile fire is possible. But as was shown in Israel's last major incursion into Gaza in 2014, the human cost would be considerable. During the operation, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed, while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed. This repeating cycle of rocket-fire, response and incursion gets neither side anywhere. At best, it buys a period of calm before the next round begins. Many might argue that it was the tensions in Jerusalem that started this particular episode. A signal once again that the Israel-Palestinian dispute cannot be ignored forever. Hamas threatened to turn Ashkelon into ""hell"" in retaliation for Israeli air strikes But with more and more Arab governments making their peace with Israel; with the Palestinians politically as divided as ever; and with this issue being far from the agenda of Israel's current leadership, it is hard to see how any progress towards a real peace can be made. For that you would need a real desire for progress on the ground and a strong and sustained effort by outside players. The conditions for this just do not appear to be there.

"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by Usman Khan at the conference on offender rehabilitation The UK's top intelligence agency did not consider a convicted terrorist a risk, an inquest court has heard. Usman Khan was jailed for a terror offence in 2012 before being released on licence six years later. He went on to kill Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt in a knife attack at London's Fishmongers' Hall. MI5 told the hearing it had been considering whether to close an ongoing investigation into Khan. A courtroom sketch of the MI5 officer Witness A giving evidence behind a screen A deputy director of MI5, known as Witness A, was giving evidence at the inquests in London's Guildhall from within a closed pod, meaning that no-one in court could see her. The court heard that Khan spent more than four years under active MI5 investigation while he was in prison and that the security service had re-opened the case in the months before his release. Witness A said MI5's prison intelligence on Khan was shared with counter terror police and that in November 2018, MI5 received intelligence that Khan might return to his ""old ways"" and re-engage in terrorist-related activity including ""carrying out an attack"". But the inquests were told that a document before the multi-agency panel responsible for managing Khan after release, only referred to the ""old ways"" intelligence, which it stated was ""low grade"" - and not the material about planning an attack. When asked in court whether she was aware the information had not been passed on, Witness A said: ""We did not know that"". MI5 continued its investigation into Khan, however, and upped its level of priority due to the prison intelligence, the inquests heard. After Khan's release from prison, it carried out two assessments to ascertain whether he might become a lone attacker, but both failed to assess him as posing such a risk, the inquests were told. Khan, from Stafford in the West Midlands, had armed himself with knives and a fake suicide belt for the attack The inquests heard that MI5 and the police held a joint meeting about Khan on 18 November 2019. Witness A said at that point the MI5 investigation into Khan was ""heading towards closure"" as it had not detected any conduct of national security concern. Eleven days after that meeting, Khan killed Ms Jones and Mr Merritt and injured three others during a conference on offender rehabilitation, which Khan had been allowed to attend unaccompanied. He had been invited to attend the Fishmongers' Hall event as he was perceived a ""success story"" of the Learning Together programmes he enrolled in while in custody. The deputy director told the court that MI5 had ""no intelligence of concern"" at the time that could have fed in to a decision on whether Khan could attend the event. She told the jury: ""We had not seen anything to suggest it was a potential source of risk"". Police 'daunted' by taking on terror offenders Fishmongers' Hall victim reluctant to go to event Killer seen as education project 'success story' The inquestspreviously heard from Khan's probation officer Ken Skeltonwho authorised his attendance at the conference. Mr Skelton told the inquests that he was unaware MI5 had been investigating Khan and that if he had known of MI5's concerns ""the whole management process would have altered"". Psychologist Ieva Cechaviciute,previously told the inqueststhat she had assessed Khan's risk of engaging in extremist activity would increase upon his release in December 2018. The inquests continue. Police 'daunted' by taking on terror offenders Terrorist posed 'high risk' after jail release Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up' Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Terror witness thought killer was 'play-fighting' Office manager begged terrorist not to stab her 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Killer called education project a 'kind of family' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Coroner warning after deaths from 'designer drug' mixed with heroin Strike tutors tell Starmer: Sort it out!

"Portugal has yet to decide whether it will allow visits from UK holidaymakers as it extends its ""state of calamity"" until 30 May. From 17 May, travellers from England and Scotland won't have to quarantine upon their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries. But those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. However, some football fans may be able to go to the planned UEFA Champions League final in Porto on 29 May. Portugal's government has announced that it is extending its ""state of public calamity"" on the mainland - the second highest level of alert - for a further 15 days from Monday, until 30 May. Under current plans, people from England and Scotland will be allowed to travel to Portugal for non-essential reasons from Monday. But whether they will be allowed in by Portugal has not been decided yet by the Portuguese government, said cabinet office minister Mariana Vieira da Silva. On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale Which countries are on the green list for foreign holidays? Covid: Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list ""I have no information to give yet,"" she said at a briefing when asked whether the UK restrictions would soon be lifted. ""Work is going on and as soon as there is a decision it will be announced, but no decision was taken in this cabinet meeting,"" she said. Travellers from the UK are one of the biggest markets for Portugal's tourism sector, along with those from Spain and France. Ms Vieira da Silva did not say when a decision on the matter might be taken. At present, Portugalallows flights to and from the UK,external, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Firms including Tui and Easyjet have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerdue to Covid uncertainty. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. The UEFA Champions League final in Porto has not yet been officially announced, but is widely expected after Portugal's government agreed to allow a limited number of fans to attend, despite this not yet being the case at domestic games. Ms Vieira da Silva said that a series of restrictions would apply. There will be a 12,000 limit on numbers and tickets will be for named people in designated seats, which will spaced in line with health guidelines. Fans will have to fly in on charters, arriving and leaving ""on the same day"" in what Ms Vieira da Silva described as ""a bubble situation"" - passing through a separate zone at the airport, as well as having to take a coronavirus test before travelling.

"Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning. And in-depth analysis by BBC News has found: nearly a third of hospitals have seen long waits balloon with over 10% of patients going a year without treatment major disruption to cancer services, with some hospitals struggling to treat half of their patients within the target time of two months concern growing for 45,000 ""missing cancer patients"", after drops in GP referrals and screening services across the UK It comes as NHS England has launched a Â£160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists. A network of ""accelerator"" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations NHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: ""With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services."" Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. The 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. But her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. It was ""the most horrendous day"", she says. ""Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk."" This video can not be played 'I might die because of surgery delays due to Covid' Elaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. She has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. ""I have got weaker,"" she says. ""I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now."" Elaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. And some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP. For University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half. It has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals. The trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally. Like others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now ""working hard"" to have patients diagnosed and treated. But it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services. About one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment. This reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising. Nonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 ""missing"" cancer patients. And the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival. ""The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,"" Steven McIntosh says. ""We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come."" Attempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward. But cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a ""monumental political effort"" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to ""super-boost"" services. ""Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,"" she adds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. Cancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations. Its report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. Cancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more. Overall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit. Outpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions The report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people. The consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments. In England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. A similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%. Most worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021. Nearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five. One of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says. It is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: ""Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely."" But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

"Travel companies have been warned they must be ready to refund consumers if foreign holidays are cancelled by the coronavirus pandemic this summer. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had reminded package holiday firms of their legal obligations. In 2020, cancelled trips resulted in 23,000 complaints to the competition watchdog. The CMA said it had taken action against five big firms, which had now refunded a total of Â£200m. These included Tui, which the watchdog said had now formally committed to giving clearer information about refunds upfront. The others were Teletext Holidays,LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com and Virgin Holidays. On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale LoveHolidays to refund Â£18m for cancelled holidays What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? This video can not be played Grant Shapps on the green list destinations: ""This is just a first step"" The UK government has said people can travel abroad again from 17 May, but destinations will be ranked for safety under a traffic light system and there are fears their status could change unexpectedly. ""We're calling on package holiday companies to make the refund process less hassle in the future,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. ""We expect all firms to give clear cancellation options and will consider appropriate steps if we see companies breaking the law by refusing or delaying refunds this summer."" Under package holiday rules, cancelled holidays must be refunded within 14 days and customers must be offered a refund, not just a credit note. Since the start of the pandemic, many people have faced last-minute cancellations of flights and holidays as travel restrictions were imposed. Some agreed to defer their holidays to a later date and accepted credit notes, but others who wanted their money back found it difficult to get refunds. As the pandemic stretched on, others who had initially agreed to put off their holidays changed their minds and decided they did want a refund after all, but experienced reluctance from travel firms. The CMA said any offer of a refund credit note had to be accompanied by the option of a full refund, while customers should be able to exchange their credit note for a refund at any time. Following customer complaints, the CMA has stepped in.It said at the end of last month,externalthat Teletext faced court action unless it paid more than Â£7m in refunds. Lastminute.com had been facing legal action in connection withÂ£1m worth of unpaid refunds, butthe CMA said in February,externalthat the money had since been repaid. The watchdog has now secured refund commitments from the other firms. People will be able to travel for leisure again from Monday, but holidays to most destinations require a period of quarantine when holidaymakers return home. Portugal is the main holiday destination currently on the ""green list"", but the travel industry is worried that countries could be added or withdrawn at short notice. The government has advised against leisure travel to ""amber list"" countries, but Tui and EasyJet are still planning to offer holidays to some of those destinations. This video can not be played How is the race to vaccinate looking around the world? An EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that many of our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday."" She added that EasyJet would not operate any holidays to destinations on the ""red"" list. On Wednesday,online travel agent On The Beachsaid it had stopped selling all holidays for this summer because of Covid uncertainty. Chief executive Simon Cooper told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been ""jaded by the experience"" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions. Mr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by ""administrative costs and loss of goodwill"".

"The Indian variant is being carefully watched amid concerns over its spread in the UK The government is ""anxious"" about the variant and ""ruling nothing out"" in response, PM Boris Johnson says People aged 18 and over in parts of Lancashire will be offered vaccines due to concerns about variant levels A record high of 4.95 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment at the end of March 2021, according to NHS England More than 436,000 people had to wait more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in March 2021 - compared with 3,097 in March 2020 Spectators could be allowed at outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC understands The Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City has been moved from Istanbul to Porto because of Covid restrictions Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from the live page team - Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Vanessa Barford. Thanks for joining us, have a good evening and we will have more updates for you tomorrow. We are going to be winding down our coronavirus live page so here's a reminder of the stories of the day: An estimated 82.1% of people classified as clinically extremely vulnerable had received both doses of coronavirus vaccine by 9 May, according to NHS England figures. The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in an ""at-risk group"" or who are unpaid carers to have received a second jab by this date was 32.2%, the data suggests. People are identified as at risk or a carer in a number of ways, including through GP records, those receiving carer's allowance or on the GP Learning Disability Register, and those identified as unpaid carers by local authorities, NHS England said. Meanwhile, an estimated 90.2% of frontline NHS trust staff in England had been given both doses of coronavirus vaccine by May 9, NHS England figures suggest. The data only represents those NHS trust healthcare workers who appear in the NHS electronic staff record (ESR) covering all directly-employed staff in NHS trusts, with the exception of Chesterfield Royal NHS Foundation Trust. It does not include data on agency staff and NHS bank staff that are not paid through the ESR, NHS England added. People included in these figures may also have been counted as being part of the same, or another high-priority group, it added. The coronavirus outbreak in Moray - which has the highest case rates of any region in Scotland - is showing ""signs of improvement"", NHS Grampian has said. A surge of cases in the area has seen the infection rate rise to more than 98 cases per 100,000 - well above the 50-case threshold to move to level two of restrictions. Mainland Scotland is due to move to level two on Monday, allowing different households to meet indoors, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Moray is likely to remain in level three. Read more The culture secretary has said that he is more confident âwith
every passing dayâ that arts and sports venues in England will be able to fully reopen on
the 21 June. However, Oliver Dowden told the
Commons Culture Committee he could not yet give âfull assuranceâ
that the last stage in the roadmap for easing lockdown would be met. He also dismissed calls for a taxpayer-backed indemnity
scheme, but suggested that if events have to be cancelled due to a lack of
insurance, the government would look at intervening. Under the plans for easing restrictions in England, all legal limits on social contact are due to be lifted on 21 June. But some large events that had been planned for the summer, such as festivals, have already cancelled their events,saying they were unable to get coronavirus insurance and they could not continue to spend money without this safety net. People need to ""stop panicking"" every time a new coronavirus variant is identified in the UK, a leading scientist has said, amid concern about the growing number of cases of the Indian variant. Professor Robert Dingwall, who is a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said that while the Indian variant may be capable of becoming the dominant
variant in the UK, the risk of a surge in deaths or hospital admissions remains
low. Prof Dingwall, of the School of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, told the PA news agency: ""This variant seems to be better managed by the
vaccines than the South African variant so that vaccinated people have only a
very low risk of infection that is likely to be mild."" TheIndian variantof coronavirus is causing concern over its spread in the UK. But it is just one of the many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid-19 circulating around the world. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? Why do viruses mutate? And when does a variant become a variant of concern? Health correspondent Laura Foster and virologist Dr Cindy Duke explain. This video can not be played Covid India variant: What is a variant of concern? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The variant that was first
detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern. Numbers are relatively low, but
they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would
accelerate that spread. Meanwhile the hugely successful
vaccination campaign is not yet complete. So the worry is there is still
the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect,
a rise in the numbers in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would
have been without vaccination. The other issue is the number of
confirmed cases tells us what happened one-to-two weeks ago - due to the delay
between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being
confirmed as B.1.617.2. One of the four tests for the
roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants. The key question is whether
local approaches in variant hotspots â such as expanded testing and vaccination
â would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan. Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19. Thelatest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwhich took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present. The graphic below shows how this figure rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80. Presence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine. You can find more detail on the surveyhere.

A total of54,797,640coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,906,671first doses and18,890,969second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabshere. There have been a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,651. There were also 2,657 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Surge testing
has already been introduced in some parts of the UK to help curb the spread of the
variant first found in India. Cases have
been detected in a number of areas of England including: There are also at least 12 cases of the Indian variant inNorthern Ireland, although officials have not confirmed exactly where they are. In Scotland, there are around 20-30 cases and the variant is suspected to be spreading inGlasgow, although this has yet to be confirmed. Cases have also been found inWales. Anxiety is growing about a coronavirus variant, first identified in India, that appears to be spreading in the UK. The concern is that certain new variants of the virus, like this one, may be able to spread more easily, make people sicker, or overpower vaccines. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than the other two in the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective, say UK officials. But the UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Here's what we know about coronavirus variants so far. If you were in two minds about getting your coronavirus jab, would the chance of winning a big cash prize sway you? The US state of Ohio is giving five people $1m (Â£710,000) each for getting their Covid-19 vaccines. It's part of a lottery launched to boost flagging take-up of jabs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the weekly draws will be paid for by coronavirus relief funds from the federal government. The US has given 58.7% of its adult population jabs against the disease. President Joe Biden says he wants to vaccinate 70% of adults by 4 July - American Independence Day. But, for weeks now, the number of vaccines administered has been in decline nationwide. Health officials have attributed this to hesitancy among some Americans. To convince the undecided, eye-catching giveaways - including beer, donuts, tickets to sporting events and cash prizes - are being offered in different parts of the country. Here's how the draw works. English Heritage staff at Durbar room at Osborne on the Isle of Wight are among those preparing for the reopening of England's visitor attractions on Monday If you're just joining us or need a recap of the day's coronavirus news - here's what we've been talking about so far. State governments in India are trying to buy coronavirus vaccines worth billions of dollars on the international market as locally-manufactured supplies run short. The most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, said it had been talking to firms including Pfizer. State authorities have had to curtail their ambitious vaccination plans amid the record surge in infections. It is not clear how soon manufacturers could supply India, with demand for vaccines remaining high. India has been vaccinating its population with the AstraZeneca jab, produced under licence in the country, and the domestically made Covaxin - but their current rate of production is well below demand. The country has only fully vaccinated 3% of its 1.3 billion people. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine was approved in the UK on Wednesday As we reported earlier, all adults will be offered Covid jabs in parts of Lancashire where there's been a spike in cases of the Indian coronavirus variant. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council has told us they're holding a meeting later and will release more details of the vaccination programme afterwards. A spokeswoman said: ""The council and NHS partners have secured extra doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be made available to anyone in Blackburn with Darwen aged over 18 from next week."" It comes as No 10 saysit has not ruled out surge vaccinationsas a way to deal with the rise of the Indian variant. Here's everything we know about the situation in Blackburn so far. The world could be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of March next year, according to the body that represents the biggest pharmaceutical companies. Thomas Cueni, who is director general of the Swiss-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) estimates global Covid vaccine manufacturing capacity will be 10 billion by the end of this year and that the world will have more vaccines than it needs by next year. Separately, he says waiving patent protection - as suggested by the US - would not lead to a short-term increase in global vaccine production because there are bottlenecks when it comes to securing the necessary raw materials such as glass vials. Too many new manufacturers coming on stream would simply lead to an even greater shortage of raw materials, he says. You can use ourCovid vaccine trackerto compare the roll-out of jabs around the world. Covid-19 case rates have increased slightly across most regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England. In the North West the rate was 32.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 9 May, up from 25.5 the previous week, while in the East Midlands it increased from 23.1 to 29.8. Slight increases were also recorded in the East of England, London and the North East. The South West had the lowest rate at 13.1, up from 12.2. Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest rate at 40.5 cases per 100,000 people, down slightly from 42.5 in the previous week. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis had told families the PM would write to them Relatives of the Ballymurphy victims have spoken of their anger over a written apology from the prime minister. Aninquest has found10 people, who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast, were ""entirely innocent"". Families received the letter from Boris Johnson on Thursday morning. John Teggart, whose father Daniel was among the victims, said the tone and timing of the apology was unacceptable. He said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for ""the events at Ballymurphy"" in 1971. John Teggart (centre) made a statement on behalf of the families on Thursday afternoon In a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: ""The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger."" He added: ""It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. ""We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing."" Mr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. ""The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable. ""We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved."" Mr Teggart said the next step was to make ""somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones"". Janet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson ""didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself"". ""If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself."" Carmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words ""the events"" to describe what happened. Carmel Quinn, whose brother John Laverty was killed, expressed her anger at the PM's wording ""It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,"" she said. In his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government ""profoundly regrets and is truly sorry"" for what happened in Ballymurphy. He said this also extended to the families for the ""additional pain"" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled. This video can not be played 'Do this right - we want Boris Johnson at despatch box' Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like ""second class citizens"" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement. ""Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?"" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. ""Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris."" Ballymurphy: Who were the victims? 'Entirely innocent': What happened at Ballymurphy? Mr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families. He said there was ""no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles"". ""This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,"" Mr Lewis said. On Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call. However, on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call. Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during a phone call with the first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday Speaking of his subsequent letter, she added: ""A second hand apology is no apology at all."" Ms McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown ""courage, dignity, resilience and stamina"". ""I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here."" But some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public. On Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted ""to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt"" caused to the Ballymurphy families. Briege Voyle and John Teggart, whose relatives were killed in Ballymurphy, watch the NI secretary deliver his address Among the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two. Nine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. However, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr. Mr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. ""The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,"" Mr Lewis said. ""Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth."" Brandon Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened He added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was ""strong and legitimate"". ""Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,"" he said. ""We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future."" A number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. The Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister ""apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed"". Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a ""profound failure of justice"". ""In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,"" she said. ""Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not ""suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty"". The government is tobring forward legislation in the course of the next yearto deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Based on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations. Mr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that ""we get to the heart of what happened"". Amnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles. There has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed. But it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Not just future cases, but potentially, those already in train. It would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Initial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups. Sources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. The plan has been met with loud opposition. Already, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless. The legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved. But they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions. The government believes this is the key. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were ""sheer bloody murder"". ""Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?"" Mr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the ""courage and dignity"" of the families affected. ""Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?"" he asked. Denis Bradley, co-author of theConsultative Group on the Past Report,externalin 2009, said a statute of limitations was ""possibly workable"" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a ""hierarchy"" for victims. ""For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,"" he told BBC News NI's The View programme. Mr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy. On Thursday, he said the criminal justice system ""is not the place to do the past"". ""The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,"" he added. Mr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was ""information"" rather than court proceedings. PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971 Ballymurphy: Who were the victims?

"Mahmood used police cars to try to stop drugs couriers and ""seize"" their money A Metropolitan Police officer who pretended to stop and search drug dealers so he could steal their money has been jailed for eight years. Kashif Mahmood seized hundreds of thousands of pounds for an organised crime gang controlled from Dubai. The gang received information about when money was on the move so that Mahmood could intercept it - in uniform - using police cars. Four other men and a woman received sentences of up to 16 years. The sentences follow an investigation which benefited from the penetration of the Encrochat mobile phone network in 2020. Clockwise from top L: Shazad Khan, Shabaz Khan, Moshin Khan, Ioan Gherghel and Maria Shah - all had entered guilty pleas Passing sentence, His Honour Judge Tomlinson said Kashif Mahmood had abused his position of ""power, trust and responsibility"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the case ""shocking"" but said she was ""delighted"" the Met's anti corruption officers ""were able to mount this operation and to catch those people and to actually have a big impact on an organised criminal network"". Of corrupt officers, Dame Cressida added: ""They betray the rest of us and we deplore this form of corruption or any corruption."" Mahmood was a police officer for 10 years, receiving a string of commendations before being dismissed in November The defendants pleaded guilty to offences including acquiring criminal property, money laundering and drug supply. It was a sophisticated criminal operation based on tip-offs from a shadowy figure in Dubai, named in court as Mutjaba Neazmand. Using the code name ""SSNew"" on the Encrochat network, the court heard he was involved in large-scale drug dealing, but also directing gang members to ""steal back"" the proceeds. Neazmand would contact the gang's leader in the UK, Mohsin Khan, with information about ""jobs"" - large amounts of money being carried by drug couriers. Khan, whose Encrochat nickname was ""AcquaPlus"" would pass on the details to police officer Kashif Mahmood, who had served in the Met for 10 years. Mahmood would book out police cars from Stoke Newington Police station, and pick up an accomplice, Ioan Gherghel, to pose as his partner. The police seized 20kg of cannabis at the home of one of Khan brothers Backed up by Khan and his two brothers, they would then try to stop the couriers and ""seize"" their money. Often the couriers had been given the cash by the Khan gang as part of a drug deal. When it was stolen back by the Khans and Mahmood, they were left out of pocket, and at risk of reprisals from their criminal associates. The scam was so successful the gang seized more than a million pounds, prosecutors believe. By March 2020 ""SSNew"" or Neazmand, the mastermind in Dubai, was boasting in Encrochat messages that: ""We can do 1500m and I still say to u bro we do more."" ""This system is in our hand. We can do it unlimited."" Police say Encrochat was almost exclusively used by criminals who communicated freely, believing their conversations were encrypted. It was penetrated by French police and intelligence agency cyber security experts in early 2020, and, as a result, more than 1,500 suspects have been arrested so far. The Khan gang were caught following a number of ""jobs"", including one where they inadvertently targeted a drug courier, while he was under police surveillance. Prosecutors believe the gang had handed him half a million pounds, in return for drugs. Mahmood and Gherghel, also dressed as police officers, then stopped the man's car in Chingford, East London, searched it, and took the money back. This meant that the gang now had both the cash and the drugs. But surveillance officers belonging to a police proactive money laundering team were, by chance, watching what happened. They stopped Mahmood to find out why the search of the target's car had been carried out, and requested he create an intelligence report. Mahmood's body worn video camera was inadvertently triggered and captured pictures of Gherghel, dressed as a police officer and sitting in the police car with him  A still from Mahmood's bodycam which was accidentally triggered during the Chingford stop and search Prosecutors said Mahmood was forced to go to his police station, despite being signed off on sick leave to complete the report. It was used by police as evidence against him. They also analysed extensive mobile phone evidence to build up a picture of the gang's communications and movements. Following arrests, large amounts of cash were found in the conspirators' homes. Cash seized at an address shared by Maria Shah, Moshin Khan and Shazad Khan Maria Shah, a partner of one of the gang, and also convicted of being involved, is believed to have withdrawn a large amount of cash from a safety deposit box facility in Knightsbridge, central London. When police searched the boxes they were found to be empty. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which worked to ensure the investigation was thorough and impartial, called Mahmood's behaviour ""audacious corrupt and criminal"". ""His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing,"" said the IOPC's director of major investigations, Steve Noonan. ""While all the evidence we have seen points towards this being an isolated case of police corruption... we have to remain vigilant and will continue to pursue allegations of corruption vigorously.""

"Fraud and error on the main universal credit benefit have reached record levels, according to new official figures. According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Â£8.4bn was lost in 2020-21, up from Â£4.6bn the previous year. Officials say the rise is almost entirely due to fraud. The number of people on universal credit has doubled to six million since the start of the pandemic. Officials say the increase in universal credit fraud is a product of more people applying for the benefit, and the value of each fraudulent case rising, rather than a higher proportion of people engaging in fraud. Benefit scams worth Â£1bn foiled during lockdown Universal credit claims hit record during lockdown The overall level of fraud and error across the benefits system increased by almost two-thirds, from 2.4% last year to 3.9%, the highest ever reported rate. The fraud rate on the main benefit, universal credit, has increased by more than 50% over the past year, and now stands at 14.5%. The DWP says the vast majority of claims are genuine and the benefit provides a vital safety net for people in need. Fraud can be as simple as individuals claiming money to which they are not entitled, for example by not declaring income from other sources. More complex cases involve criminal gangs stealing people's details to apply for advance payments of universal credit. The money is paid to them but the person whose identity has been stolen gets the bill. Universal credit claimants targeted in scam Loan firm 'duped' mum out of benefits As Covid-19 hit the UK last spring and the economy was effectively mothballed, the sheer demand for universal credit in March and April led the government to relax some welfare rules, which allowedcriminal gangs to target the benefit and steal as much as Â£1.5bn. Identity checks were processed online, for instance, rather than face-to-face and some information was taken on trust, such as the cost of rent. It was not until a letter from the DWP dropped through her door last November, demanding repayment of a Â£1,475.52 universal credit advance, that Jo Darby, 37, realised she had a problem. Ms Darby, from Birmingham, had been working full-time throughout the pandemic and had never claimed benefits, let alone an advance, so she immediately assumed fraud. Fraudster's stole Jo Darby's details to claim a benefit advance, leaving her with the bill But convincing the DWP proved difficult - there was no reply on the helpline number on the letter and when the fraud team eventually called back, they refused to talk to her because she was unable to verify the security questions on the scam universal credit account. Two weeks later Ms Darby's employer told her they had been instructed to deduct money from her salary. ""I felt like I was going round in circles and had no control,"" she told the BBC. ""They hadn't taken on my concerns regarding the fraud and they'd already started to recover that debt without fully investigating the situation."" It took the intervention of BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme to resolve the situation. Ms Darby later discovered the original fraud actually happened in June. ""For all that time, someone was pretending to be me and there were no significant checks in place,"" she says. Other factors in 2020 include confusion among many new claimants, who applied for both universal credit and the government's Self Employment Income Support Scheme - income from the scheme can mean claimants should receive less universal credit. Officials also say pre-pandemic concerns that the rules around declaring capital and savings are complex and driving high levels of fraud and error have not been addressed and are becoming more acute as the number of people claiming universal credit rockets. Reacting to the figures, a DWP official said ""following an unprecedented year... fraud and error in the benefits system remains low with 95% of benefits worth more than Â£200bn paid correctly. ""We take any abuse of taxpayers' money very seriously and those who claim benefits they are untitled to will face criminal prosecution. ""We also have robust plans in place to recover fraudulent claims and drive fraud and error down to the lowest feasible level."" Have you been a victim of universal credit fraud?

"Eluned Morgan and Jeremy Miles are rewarded with promotions within the cabinet Eluned Morgan has been named health minister with Jeremy Miles at education in a Welsh government reshuffle. In a surprise move, Vaughan Gething moves from health to economy, replacing Ken Skates who leaves the government. Mark Drakeford was sworn in as first minister earlier, after Senedd members backed him to continue in the role on Wednesday. Labour won 30 of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament in last week's election. Both Mr Gething and Mr Skates had been in their previous posts for five years. Mr Gething had a particularly high profile as health minister during the pandemic, in leading the response to the coronavirus crisis alongside Mr Drakeford and the chief medical officer. Vaughan Gething visited an NHS depot collecting supplies for India in one of his last acts as health minister on Monday Announcing the changes, the first minister paid tribute to Mr Skates, who he said would ""continue speaking up for north Wales and for Welsh Labour, but in a different role"". ""We will miss his energy and passion,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said Mr Gething's efforts during the pandemic had been ""extraordinary"" but he felt it was time ""to ask someone else to take on that challenge"". The former health minister, he said, was taking over the economy job ""at a crucial point in time - the pandemic is not just a public health emergency but also an economic one"". Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said there had been ""rumours for a while that Vaughan Gething wanted to move from the health portfolio"". ""He's been in position there for five years and was a deputy before that, and that's quite a long stint really, in a very difficult role and not least, of course, during a pandemic, so I can see the logic to that,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. Prof McAllister said his replacement, Eluned Morgan, as health minister had a ""very effective time during the pandemic in terms of fronting up on government policy, sometimes at very difficult times"", and she was being rewarded for that. Mark Drakeford (centre) assembles his new team at the Welsh government offices in Cardiff The new cabinet was expected to meet on Thursday evening to finalise Friday's Covid lockdown restrictions review. Julie James has been appointed to a new cabinet role as minister for climate change, with Lee Waters as her deputy. Mr Drakeford said: ""The environment will be at the heart of our decision-making. ""The climate change emergency has not gone away while we have been dealing with the pandemic. ""Wales is a beautiful country with immense natural assets, which will help power our recovery and create the jobs of the future. ""In my new government, the environment doesn't just have a seat at the cabinet table, it will be a consideration in all we do."" Jane Hutt moves from chief whip to a newly created post of minister for social justice. Two thirds of the new cabinet are women. Allow Twitter content?

Dawn Bowden, Member of the Senedd (MS) for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, joins the government from the backbenches as deputy minister for arts and sport and takes over Ms Hutt's former role of chief whip, responsible for ensuring discipline in the Labour ranks. Torfaen MS Lynne Neagle, a Cardiff Bay politician since 1999, also gets a government job for the first time, as deputy minister for mental health and wellbeing. In a statement marking his departure as economy minister, Mr Skates said: ""This week I informed the first minister of my wish to step away from Welsh government. After eight years in government, now is the right time."" He added: ""Clwyd South has always remained my number one priority, and my decision will enable me to spend more time in the constituency, focusing on local matters, as well as further strengthening the party's position in north Wales and further afield."" Conservative Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies said his members would ""scrutinise and hold ministers to account, but will also offer the hand of cooperation where possible to ensure Wales bounces back from the most difficult year we've experienced"". ""It's in this spirit that I want to wish the first minister and his new cabinet well as they start the significant task of ensuring our economy and public services get on the road to recovery,"" he said. Plaid Cymru South Wales West MS Sioned Williams welcomed the ""greater focus on climate change and mental health"" but urged new ministers in other portfolios to address the ""policy shortcomings and lack of delivery of their predecessors"". ""With record waiting lists, a low wage economy and one in three children living in poverty - all there before the pandemic and all on Labour's watch - we are in danger of getting the same results if ministers do the same thing over and over again,"" she said. The next Senedd term takes us through well over half of what the UK's advisers on climate change describe as a ""decisive decade"". By 2030 Wales needs to have got rid of two thirds of its greenhouse gas emissions. And if there's hope of no longer contributing to global warming by 2050, the complex rewiring required of our economy and way of life must truly get under way. It's a monumental task and these new climate change ministerial and deputy ministerial roles should be considered among the most senior and important jobs in the Welsh government. But of course every department and minister will have to work out how they too can rise to this challenge, with Wales already starting to feel the potentially disastrous effects of a changing climate.

"Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning. And in-depth analysis by BBC News has found: nearly a third of hospitals have seen long waits balloon with over 10% of patients going a year without treatment major disruption to cancer services, with some hospitals struggling to treat half of their patients within the target time of two months concern growing for 45,000 ""missing cancer patients"", after drops in GP referrals and screening services across the UK It comes as NHS England has launched a Â£160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists. A network of ""accelerator"" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations NHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: ""With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services."" Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. The 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. But her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. It was ""the most horrendous day"", she says. ""Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk."" This video can not be played 'I might die because of surgery delays due to Covid' Elaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. She has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. ""I have got weaker,"" she says. ""I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now."" Elaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. And some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP. For University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half. It has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals. The trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally. Like others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now ""working hard"" to have patients diagnosed and treated. But it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services. About one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment. This reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising. Nonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 ""missing"" cancer patients. And the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival. ""The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,"" Steven McIntosh says. ""We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come."" Attempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward. But cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a ""monumental political effort"" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to ""super-boost"" services. ""Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,"" she adds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. Cancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations. Its report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. Cancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more. Overall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit. Outpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions The report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people. The consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments. In England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. A similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%. Most worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021. Nearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five. One of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says. It is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: ""Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely."" But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

"This video can not be played Israeli ground troops are massing on the border with Gaza after another night of violence Israel has deployed tanks and troops to its border with Gaza, as it mulls whether to launch a ground operation in the territory after days of violence. Conflict raged throughout Thursday as Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli army maintained a barrage of air strikes. More than 100 people have been killed in Gaza and seven have died in Israel. Jewish and Israeli Arab mobs have also been fighting within Israel, prompting the president to warn of civil war. Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a ""massive reinforcement"" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest, and more than 400 people were arrested. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence Conflict cools warming of Arab-Israel ties Who are Hamas? Two infantry units and one armoured unit were positioned near the border with Gaza on Thursday. At least 7,000 army reservists have also been called up. No decision has yet been made on whether to launch a ground operation. The Israeli army is expected to put forward plans for a possible offensive imminently, but it would need to be approved by army chiefs and various levels of government. Israel deployed additional troops to its border with Gaza on Thursday The four-days of violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It was initially fuelled by weeks of Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which led to clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. This spiralled into an incessant exchange of Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes. In other developments on Thursday: Three rockets were fired from Lebanon into the sea off the coast of northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. No group said they were responsible, but several militant groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 Israel's military said it had hit targets in Gaza that included intelligence buildings and homes and businesses used by militants The Palestinian militant group Hamas, meanwhile, fired further barrages of rockets towards Israel from Gaza, and a spokesman for the group said it had shown ""only a small part"" of its capabilities Further violence broke out between Jewish and Israeli Arab groups in mixed towns and cities within Israel International airlines, including KLM, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended services to Israel. Incoming flights were also diverted south from Tel Aviv's main airport According to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 103 people have been killed in the four-days of conflict. Officials in the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, many civilians have died including 27 children. Israel says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza. In the Israeli city of Sderot, a young boy was killed when rocket fire from Gaza hit his home, and shrapnel penetrated the shelter he was hiding in. Israel has also called up 10 reserve border patrol companies to help tackle the worst unrest between Arab and Jewish communities for many years. Political leaders have appealed for calm, and President Reuven Rivlin described the outbreaks of rioting in several towns and cities as ""senseless civil war"". There have been widespread calls for de-escalation, including from Israel's ally the US, but little sign of the conflict easing. A senior Hamas official said the group was ready for a ""reciprocal"" ceasefire if the international community pressures Israel to ""suppress military actions"" at the disputed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. However, Israeli military spokesman Hilda Zilberman said Israel was not seeking a ceasefire at the current time, the Times of Israel reported. The fear among civilians on both sides is taking its toll. Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad, a Gaza mother, said of Wednesday night: ""You cannot sleep... In any moment your home might be your grave. ""You cannot be secure. As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. This video can not be played BBC reporters are on the ground in Gaza, Lod and Jerusalem In Israel, an apartment block was destroyed in the city of Petah Tikva shortly after residents had gone to their bomb shelters. ""We heard an alarm and suddenly there was a bang. Smoke entered the shelter, and the neighbour next to me who was sitting on a chair flew back,"" one resident told the news website Ynet. The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

"Mahmood used police cars to try to stop drugs couriers and ""seize"" their money A Metropolitan Police officer who pretended to stop and search drug dealers so he could steal their money has been jailed for eight years. Kashif Mahmood seized hundreds of thousands of pounds for an organised crime gang controlled from Dubai. The gang received information about when money was on the move so that Mahmood could intercept it - in uniform - using police cars. Four other men and a woman received sentences of up to 16 years. The sentences follow an investigation which benefited from the penetration of the Encrochat mobile phone network in 2020. Clockwise from top L: Shazad Khan, Shabaz Khan, Moshin Khan, Ioan Gherghel and Maria Shah - all had entered guilty pleas Passing sentence, His Honour Judge Tomlinson said Kashif Mahmood had abused his position of ""power, trust and responsibility"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the case ""shocking"" but said she was ""delighted"" the Met's anti corruption officers ""were able to mount this operation and to catch those people and to actually have a big impact on an organised criminal network"". Of corrupt officers, Dame Cressida added: ""They betray the rest of us and we deplore this form of corruption or any corruption."" Mahmood was a police officer for 10 years, receiving a string of commendations before being dismissed in November The defendants pleaded guilty to offences including acquiring criminal property, money laundering and drug supply. It was a sophisticated criminal operation based on tip-offs from a shadowy figure in Dubai, named in court as Mutjaba Neazmand. Using the code name ""SSNew"" on the Encrochat network, the court heard he was involved in large-scale drug dealing, but also directing gang members to ""steal back"" the proceeds. Neazmand would contact the gang's leader in the UK, Mohsin Khan, with information about ""jobs"" - large amounts of money being carried by drug couriers. Khan, whose Encrochat nickname was ""AcquaPlus"" would pass on the details to police officer Kashif Mahmood, who had served in the Met for 10 years. Mahmood would book out police cars from Stoke Newington Police station, and pick up an accomplice, Ioan Gherghel, to pose as his partner. The police seized 20kg of cannabis at the home of one of Khan brothers Backed up by Khan and his two brothers, they would then try to stop the couriers and ""seize"" their money. Often the couriers had been given the cash by the Khan gang as part of a drug deal. When it was stolen back by the Khans and Mahmood, they were left out of pocket, and at risk of reprisals from their criminal associates. The scam was so successful the gang seized more than a million pounds, prosecutors believe. By March 2020 ""SSNew"" or Neazmand, the mastermind in Dubai, was boasting in Encrochat messages that: ""We can do 1500m and I still say to u bro we do more."" ""This system is in our hand. We can do it unlimited."" Police say Encrochat was almost exclusively used by criminals who communicated freely, believing their conversations were encrypted. It was penetrated by French police and intelligence agency cyber security experts in early 2020, and, as a result, more than 1,500 suspects have been arrested so far. The Khan gang were caught following a number of ""jobs"", including one where they inadvertently targeted a drug courier, while he was under police surveillance. Prosecutors believe the gang had handed him half a million pounds, in return for drugs. Mahmood and Gherghel, also dressed as police officers, then stopped the man's car in Chingford, East London, searched it, and took the money back. This meant that the gang now had both the cash and the drugs. But surveillance officers belonging to a police proactive money laundering team were, by chance, watching what happened. They stopped Mahmood to find out why the search of the target's car had been carried out, and requested he create an intelligence report. Mahmood's body worn video camera was inadvertently triggered and captured pictures of Gherghel, dressed as a police officer and sitting in the police car with him  A still from Mahmood's bodycam which was accidentally triggered during the Chingford stop and search Prosecutors said Mahmood was forced to go to his police station, despite being signed off on sick leave to complete the report. It was used by police as evidence against him. They also analysed extensive mobile phone evidence to build up a picture of the gang's communications and movements. Following arrests, large amounts of cash were found in the conspirators' homes. Cash seized at an address shared by Maria Shah, Moshin Khan and Shazad Khan Maria Shah, a partner of one of the gang, and also convicted of being involved, is believed to have withdrawn a large amount of cash from a safety deposit box facility in Knightsbridge, central London. When police searched the boxes they were found to be empty. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which worked to ensure the investigation was thorough and impartial, called Mahmood's behaviour ""audacious corrupt and criminal"". ""His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing,"" said the IOPC's director of major investigations, Steve Noonan. ""While all the evidence we have seen points towards this being an isolated case of police corruption... we have to remain vigilant and will continue to pursue allegations of corruption vigorously.""

"The Indian variant is being carefully watched amid concerns over its spread in the UK The government is ""anxious"" about the variant and ""ruling nothing out"" in response, PM Boris Johnson says People aged 18 and over in parts of Lancashire will be offered vaccines due to concerns about variant levels A record high of 4.95 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment at the end of March 2021, according to NHS England More than 436,000 people had to wait more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in March 2021 - compared with 3,097 in March 2020 Spectators could be allowed at outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC understands The Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City has been moved from Istanbul to Porto because of Covid restrictions Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from the live page team - Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Vanessa Barford. Thanks for joining us, have a good evening and we will have more updates for you tomorrow. We are going to be winding down our coronavirus live page so here's a reminder of the stories of the day: An estimated 82.1% of people classified as clinically extremely vulnerable had received both doses of coronavirus vaccine by 9 May, according to NHS England figures. The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in an ""at-risk group"" or who are unpaid carers to have received a second jab by this date was 32.2%, the data suggests. People are identified as at risk or a carer in a number of ways, including through GP records, those receiving carer's allowance or on the GP Learning Disability Register, and those identified as unpaid carers by local authorities, NHS England said. Meanwhile, an estimated 90.2% of frontline NHS trust staff in England had been given both doses of coronavirus vaccine by May 9, NHS England figures suggest. The data only represents those NHS trust healthcare workers who appear in the NHS electronic staff record (ESR) covering all directly-employed staff in NHS trusts, with the exception of Chesterfield Royal NHS Foundation Trust. It does not include data on agency staff and NHS bank staff that are not paid through the ESR, NHS England added. People included in these figures may also have been counted as being part of the same, or another high-priority group, it added. The coronavirus outbreak in Moray - which has the highest case rates of any region in Scotland - is showing ""signs of improvement"", NHS Grampian has said. A surge of cases in the area has seen the infection rate rise to more than 98 cases per 100,000 - well above the 50-case threshold to move to level two of restrictions. Mainland Scotland is due to move to level two on Monday, allowing different households to meet indoors, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Moray is likely to remain in level three.

every passing dayâ that arts and sports venues in England will be able to fully reopen on
the 21 June. However, Oliver Dowden told the
Commons Culture Committee he could not yet give âfull assuranceâ
that the last stage in the roadmap for easing lockdown would be met. He also dismissed calls for a taxpayer-backed indemnity
scheme, but suggested that if events have to be cancelled due to a lack of
insurance, the government would look at intervening. Under the plans for easing restrictions in England, all legal limits on social contact are due to be lifted on 21 June. But some large events that had been planned for the summer, such as festivals, have already cancelled their events,saying they were unable to get coronavirus insurance and they could not continue to spend money without this safety net. People need to ""stop panicking"" every time a new coronavirus variant is identified in the UK, a leading scientist has said, amid concern about the growing number of cases of the Indian variant. Professor Robert Dingwall, who is a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said that while the Indian variant may be capable of becoming the dominant
variant in the UK, the risk of a surge in deaths or hospital admissions remains
low. Prof Dingwall, of the School of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, told the PA news agency: ""This variant seems to be better managed by the
vaccines than the South African variant so that vaccinated people have only a
very low risk of infection that is likely to be mild."" TheIndian variantof coronavirus is causing concern over its spread in the UK. But it is just one of the many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid-19 circulating around the world. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? Why do viruses mutate? And when does a variant become a variant of concern? Health correspondent Laura Foster and virologist Dr Cindy Duke explain. This video can not be played Covid India variant: What is a variant of concern? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The variant that was first
detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern. Numbers are relatively low, but
they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would
accelerate that spread. Meanwhile the hugely successful
vaccination campaign is not yet complete. So the worry is there is still
the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect,
a rise in the numbers in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would
have been without vaccination. The other issue is the number of
confirmed cases tells us what happened one-to-two weeks ago - due to the delay
between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being
confirmed as B.1.617.2. One of the four tests for the
roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants. The key question is whether
local approaches in variant hotspots â such as expanded testing and vaccination
â would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan. Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19. Thelatest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwhich took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present. The graphic below shows how this figure rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80. Presence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine. You can find more detail on the surveyhere. Fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC has been told. The Northern Ireland Executive has been meeting to agree which lockdown restrictions can be lifted. It is understood ministers have agreed up to 500 fans can attend outdoor sport events from 24 May. However, up to 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend the Irish Cup final on 21 May. From 24 May, schools will also be allowed to play sports fixtures against each other and libraries and museums can reopen, while the stay local message will end. Indoor hospitality will be permitted to resume from 24 May - with mitigations - and indoor sports training will be allowed to restart for sports squads. Plans to ease restrictions on 24 May will be subject to final approval on 21 May. Read more.

You can find out when you'll get your jabshere. There have been a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,651. There were also 2,657 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Surge testing
has already been introduced in some parts of the UK to help curb the spread of the
variant first found in India. Cases have
been detected in a number of areas of England including: There are also at least 12 cases of the Indian variant inNorthern Ireland, although officials have not confirmed exactly where they are. In Scotland, there are around 20-30 cases and the variant is suspected to be spreading inGlasgow, although this has yet to be confirmed. Cases have also been found inWales. Anxiety is growing about a coronavirus variant, first identified in India, that appears to be spreading in the UK. The concern is that certain new variants of the virus, like this one, may be able to spread more easily, make people sicker, or overpower vaccines. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than the other two in the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective, say UK officials. But the UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Here's what we know about coronavirus variants so far. If you were in two minds about getting your coronavirus jab, would the chance of winning a big cash prize sway you? The US state of Ohio is giving five people $1m (Â£710,000) each for getting their Covid-19 vaccines. It's part of a lottery launched to boost flagging take-up of jabs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the weekly draws will be paid for by coronavirus relief funds from the federal government. The US has given 58.7% of its adult population jabs against the disease. President Joe Biden says he wants to vaccinate 70% of adults by 4 July - American Independence Day. But, for weeks now, the number of vaccines administered has been in decline nationwide. Health officials have attributed this to hesitancy among some Americans. To convince the undecided, eye-catching giveaways - including beer, donuts, tickets to sporting events and cash prizes - are being offered in different parts of the country. Here's how the draw works. English Heritage staff at Durbar room at Osborne on the Isle of Wight are among those preparing for the reopening of England's visitor attractions on Monday If you're just joining us or need a recap of the day's coronavirus news - here's what we've been talking about so far. State governments in India are trying to buy coronavirus vaccines worth billions of dollars on the international market as locally-manufactured supplies run short. The most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, said it had been talking to firms including Pfizer. State authorities have had to curtail their ambitious vaccination plans amid the record surge in infections. It is not clear how soon manufacturers could supply India, with demand for vaccines remaining high. India has been vaccinating its population with the AstraZeneca jab, produced under licence in the country, and the domestically made Covaxin - but their current rate of production is well below demand. The country has only fully vaccinated 3% of its 1.3 billion people. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine was approved in the UK on Wednesday As we reported earlier, all adults will be offered Covid jabs in parts of Lancashire where there's been a spike in cases of the Indian coronavirus variant. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council has told us they're holding a meeting later and will release more details of the vaccination programme afterwards. A spokeswoman said: ""The council and NHS partners have secured extra doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be made available to anyone in Blackburn with Darwen aged over 18 from next week."" It comes as No 10 saysit has not ruled out surge vaccinationsas a way to deal with the rise of the Indian variant. Here's everything we know about the situation in Blackburn so far. The world could be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of March next year, according to the body that represents the biggest pharmaceutical companies. Thomas Cueni, who is director general of the Swiss-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) estimates global Covid vaccine manufacturing capacity will be 10 billion by the end of this year and that the world will have more vaccines than it needs by next year. Separately, he says waiving patent protection - as suggested by the US - would not lead to a short-term increase in global vaccine production because there are bottlenecks when it comes to securing the necessary raw materials such as glass vials. Too many new manufacturers coming on stream would simply lead to an even greater shortage of raw materials, he says. You can use ourCovid vaccine trackerto compare the roll-out of jabs around the world. Covid-19 case rates have increased slightly across most regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England. In the North West the rate was 32.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 9 May, up from 25.5 the previous week, while in the East Midlands it increased from 23.1 to 29.8. Slight increases were also recorded in the East of England, London and the North East. The South West had the lowest rate at 13.1, up from 12.2. Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest rate at 40.5 cases per 100,000 people, down slightly from 42.5 in the previous week. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Israeli ground troops are massing on the border with Gaza after another night of violence Israel has deployed tanks and troops to its border with Gaza, as it mulls whether to launch a ground operation in the territory after days of violence. Conflict raged throughout Thursday as Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli army maintained a barrage of air strikes. More than 100 people have been killed in Gaza and seven have died in Israel. Jewish and Israeli Arab mobs have also been fighting within Israel, prompting the president to warn of civil war. Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a ""massive reinforcement"" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest, and more than 400 people were arrested. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence Conflict cools warming of Arab-Israel ties Who are Hamas? Two infantry units and one armoured unit were positioned near the border with Gaza on Thursday. At least 7,000 army reservists have also been called up. No decision has yet been made on whether to launch a ground operation. The Israeli army is expected to put forward plans for a possible offensive imminently, but it would need to be approved by army chiefs and various levels of government. Israel deployed additional troops to its border with Gaza on Thursday The four-days of violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It was initially fuelled by weeks of Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which led to clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. This spiralled into an incessant exchange of Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes. In other developments on Thursday: Three rockets were fired from Lebanon into the sea off the coast of northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. No group said they were responsible, but several militant groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 Israel's military said it had hit targets in Gaza that included intelligence buildings and homes and businesses used by militants The Palestinian militant group Hamas, meanwhile, fired further barrages of rockets towards Israel from Gaza, and a spokesman for the group said it had shown ""only a small part"" of its capabilities Further violence broke out between Jewish and Israeli Arab groups in mixed towns and cities within Israel International airlines, including KLM, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended services to Israel. Incoming flights were also diverted south from Tel Aviv's main airport According to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 103 people have been killed in the four-days of conflict. Officials in the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, many civilians have died including 27 children. Israel says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza. In the Israeli city of Sderot, a young boy was killed when rocket fire from Gaza hit his home, and shrapnel penetrated the shelter he was hiding in. Israel has also called up 10 reserve border patrol companies to help tackle the worst unrest between Arab and Jewish communities for many years. Political leaders have appealed for calm, and President Reuven Rivlin described the outbreaks of rioting in several towns and cities as ""senseless civil war"". There have been widespread calls for de-escalation, including from Israel's ally the US, but little sign of the conflict easing. A senior Hamas official said the group was ready for a ""reciprocal"" ceasefire if the international community pressures Israel to ""suppress military actions"" at the disputed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. However, Israeli military spokesman Hilda Zilberman said Israel was not seeking a ceasefire at the current time, the Times of Israel reported. The fear among civilians on both sides is taking its toll. Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad, a Gaza mother, said of Wednesday night: ""You cannot sleep... In any moment your home might be your grave. ""You cannot be secure. As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. This video can not be played BBC reporters are on the ground in Gaza, Lod and Jerusalem In Israel, an apartment block was destroyed in the city of Petah Tikva shortly after residents had gone to their bomb shelters. ""We heard an alarm and suddenly there was a bang. Smoke entered the shelter, and the neighbour next to me who was sitting on a chair flew back,"" one resident told the news website Ynet. The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

Thanks for joining us, have a good evening and we will have more updates for you tomorrow. We are going to be winding down our coronavirus live page so here's a reminder of the stories of the day: An estimated 82.1% of people classified as clinically extremely vulnerable had received both doses of coronavirus vaccine by 9 May, according to NHS England figures. The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in an ""at-risk group"" or who are unpaid carers to have received a second jab by this date was 32.2%, the data suggests. People are identified as at risk or a carer in a number of ways, including through GP records, those receiving carer's allowance or on the GP Learning Disability Register, and those identified as unpaid carers by local authorities, NHS England said. Meanwhile, an estimated 90.2% of frontline NHS trust staff in England had been given both doses of coronavirus vaccine by May 9, NHS England figures suggest. The data only represents those NHS trust healthcare workers who appear in the NHS electronic staff record (ESR) covering all directly-employed staff in NHS trusts, with the exception of Chesterfield Royal NHS Foundation Trust. It does not include data on agency staff and NHS bank staff that are not paid through the ESR, NHS England added. People included in these figures may also have been counted as being part of the same, or another high-priority group, it added. The coronavirus outbreak in Moray - which has the highest case rates of any region in Scotland - is showing ""signs of improvement"", NHS Grampian has said. A surge of cases in the area has seen the infection rate rise to more than 98 cases per 100,000 - well above the 50-case threshold to move to level two of restrictions.

Professor Robert Dingwall, who is a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said that while the Indian variant may be capable of becoming the dominant
variant in the UK, the risk of a surge in deaths or hospital admissions remains
low. Prof Dingwall, of the School of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, told the PA news agency: ""This variant seems to be better managed by the
vaccines than the South African variant so that vaccinated people have only a
very low risk of infection that is likely to be mild."" TheIndian variantof coronavirus is causing concern over its spread in the UK. But it is just one of the many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid-19 circulating around the world. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? Why do viruses mutate? And when does a variant become a variant of concern? Health correspondent Laura Foster and virologist Dr Cindy Duke explain. This video can not be played Covid India variant: What is a variant of concern? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The variant that was first
detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern. Numbers are relatively low, but
they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would
accelerate that spread. Meanwhile the hugely successful
vaccination campaign is not yet complete. So the worry is there is still
the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect,
a rise in the numbers in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would
have been without vaccination. The other issue is the number of

a rise in the numbers in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would
have been without vaccination. The other issue is the number of
confirmed cases tells us what happened one-to-two weeks ago - due to the delay
between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being
confirmed as B.1.617.2. One of the four tests for the
roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants. The key question is whether
local approaches in variant hotspots â such as expanded testing and vaccination
â would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan. Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19. Thelatest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwhich took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present. The graphic below shows how this figure rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80. Presence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine. You can find more detail on the surveyhere. Fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC has been told. The Northern Ireland Executive has been meeting to agree which lockdown restrictions can be lifted. It is understood ministers have agreed up to 500 fans can attend outdoor sport events from 24 May. However, up to 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend the Irish Cup final on 21 May. From 24 May, schools will also be allowed to play sports fixtures against each other and libraries and museums can reopen, while the stay local message will end. Indoor hospitality will be permitted to resume from 24 May - with mitigations - and indoor sports training will be allowed to restart for sports squads. Plans to ease restrictions on 24 May will be subject to final approval on 21 May. Read more. A total of54,797,640coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,906,671first doses and18,890,969second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabshere. There have been a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,651. There were also 2,657 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Surge testing
has already been introduced in some parts of the UK to help curb the spread of the
variant first found in India. Cases have
been detected in a number of areas of England including: There are also at least 12 cases of the Indian variant inNorthern Ireland, although officials have not confirmed exactly where they are. In Scotland, there are around 20-30 cases and the variant is suspected to be spreading inGlasgow, although this has yet to be confirmed. Cases have also been found inWales. Anxiety is growing about a coronavirus variant, first identified in India, that appears to be spreading in the UK. The concern is that certain new variants of the virus, like this one, may be able to spread more easily, make people sicker, or overpower vaccines. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than the other two in the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective, say UK officials. But the UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Here's what we know about coronavirus variants so far. If you were in two minds about getting your coronavirus jab, would the chance of winning a big cash prize sway you? The US state of Ohio is giving five people $1m (Â£710,000) each for getting their Covid-19 vaccines. It's part of a lottery launched to boost flagging take-up of jabs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the weekly draws will be paid for by coronavirus relief funds from the federal government. The US has given 58.7% of its adult population jabs against the disease. President Joe Biden says he wants to vaccinate 70% of adults by 4 July - American Independence Day. But, for weeks now, the number of vaccines administered has been in decline nationwide. Health officials have attributed this to hesitancy among some Americans. To convince the undecided, eye-catching giveaways - including beer, donuts, tickets to sporting events and cash prizes - are being offered in different parts of the country. Here's how the draw works. English Heritage staff at Durbar room at Osborne on the Isle of Wight are among those preparing for the reopening of England's visitor attractions on Monday If you're just joining us or need a recap of the day's coronavirus news - here's what we've been talking about so far. State governments in India are trying to buy coronavirus vaccines worth billions of dollars on the international market as locally-manufactured supplies run short. The most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, said it had been talking to firms including Pfizer. State authorities have had to curtail their ambitious vaccination plans amid the record surge in infections. It is not clear how soon manufacturers could supply India, with demand for vaccines remaining high. India has been vaccinating its population with the AstraZeneca jab, produced under licence in the country, and the domestically made Covaxin - but their current rate of production is well below demand. The country has only fully vaccinated 3% of its 1.3 billion people. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine was approved in the UK on Wednesday As we reported earlier, all adults will be offered Covid jabs in parts of Lancashire where there's been a spike in cases of the Indian coronavirus variant. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council has told us they're holding a meeting later and will release more details of the vaccination programme afterwards. A spokeswoman said: ""The council and NHS partners have secured extra doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be made available to anyone in Blackburn with Darwen aged over 18 from next week."" It comes as No 10 saysit has not ruled out surge vaccinationsas a way to deal with the rise of the Indian variant. Here's everything we know about the situation in Blackburn so far. The world could be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of March next year, according to the body that represents the biggest pharmaceutical companies. Thomas Cueni, who is director general of the Swiss-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) estimates global Covid vaccine manufacturing capacity will be 10 billion by the end of this year and that the world will have more vaccines than it needs by next year. Separately, he says waiving patent protection - as suggested by the US - would not lead to a short-term increase in global vaccine production because there are bottlenecks when it comes to securing the necessary raw materials such as glass vials. Too many new manufacturers coming on stream would simply lead to an even greater shortage of raw materials, he says. You can use ourCovid vaccine trackerto compare the roll-out of jabs around the world. Covid-19 case rates have increased slightly across most regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England. In the North West the rate was 32.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 9 May, up from 25.5 the previous week, while in the East Midlands it increased from 23.1 to 29.8. Slight increases were also recorded in the East of England, London and the North East. The South West had the lowest rate at 13.1, up from 12.2. Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest rate at 40.5 cases per 100,000 people, down slightly from 42.5 in the previous week. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"David Cameron has appeared in front of two committees of MPs over his involvement with Greensill Capital He told the Public Accounts Committee he once thought the now defunct firm could be a UK ""success story"" The former PM added that he was not approached about working for it while in office Cameron gave evidence earlier to the Treasury Committee, which is also holding an inquiry MPs asked him about his work as an adviser for Greensill, which included texting current ministers Cameron said there had been ""absolutely no wrongdoing"" on his part He also revealed he had been paid ""a generous amount"" at Greensill - ""far more than"" his Â£150,402 salary as PM Alex Kleiderman, Richard Morris and Mary O'Connor Thank you for joining us for today's hearings. We're going to close the live page now, but please keep following all the reaction and latest updates on the BBC News website and the BBC News Channel. David Cameron's had a busy day in front of MPs. Here are the key points: Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier asks how David Cameron would like to be remembered. The former PM says he put together the first coalition in 70 years against the background of a ""very tricky"" economic situation. ""Do you regret the past few months?"" asks Ms Hillier. ""Well obviously it's been difficult for me,"" he replies, but he says he feels more sorry for people who worked at Greensill Capital and lost their jobs. ""There'll be lessons to learn. I'll be reading your committee report and the Treasury Committee's report,"" he says. With that, the committee session closes. Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin asks David Cameron what lessons the Public Accounts Committee should draw from this episode. Cameron replies that there's ""always work to be done"" on managing conflicts, transparency and the rules for what people do when they leave office. He cautions that, in doing this, the ability to access ""private sector skills"" and for there to be ""dialogue"" between the public and private sectors should not be lost. Conservative Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks if, with hindsight, David Cameron should have been more aware of the financial difficulties facing Greensill Capital. Cameron says he did not believe the company was in ""any severe financial difficulty"" in March and April 2020. He says founder Lex Greensill said himself that the company was only in difficulty in December 2020. Cameron adds that when he joined the company, he asked lots of questions and ""sought all kinds of answers"" about how it was operating. Committee chair Meg Hillier asks if David Cameron has disclosed all his contacts with government. Cameron says he has, but he would go away and double check them. Hillier, a Labour MP, asks how Greensill Capital, under its scheme, could afford to pay NHS staff early for no fee. Cameron says it wasn't an advance by Greensill, but the scheme was at a cost to the company. But he says the cost was ""relatively low"", especially as the NHS was going to continue paying staff. Hillier asks if Cameron was aware senior civil servant Bill Crothers had taken a role on with Greensill while still working in government. Cameron says he was ""surprised"", and was not aware. Tory MP Shaun Bailey focuses on the government's use of people working in the private sector. David Cameron says: ""Whenever you try to involve private-sector skills in the public sector and those people are maintaining private-sector roles there will always be difficulties."" He adds that there are inevitably questions about potential conflicts of interest. But he adds: ""We don't want a sort of Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors...Transparency is the key thing here."" Cameron points out the ministerial code was ""beefed up"" during his time in office, but accepts more could still be done. Richard Holden follows up, arguing that, although early payments ""would have a cost"" to the Treasury, it would be ""pretty small"". He adds that the ""bigger cost"" would have been the fact that pharmacies would have to factor in they would get less money, and would therefore charge more or push for higher prices for their products - so the ""real cost is to the taxpayer at the end of the day anyway"". Cameron says although he is not ""the world-leading expert on this"" he disagrees with Holden's assessment. ""If you've not got a good working capital solution, you have to go to the bank and borrow money, and that is going to be more expensive than the cash, less the discount, that you're getting from the supply chain finance provider"". He argues this is one of the ""key points to this whole argument"". Conservative Richard Holden asks Cameron why he could not just ""sort out the bureaucracy"" within the NHS, rather than bringing in a new financial product. ""Surely that would have been the most sensible thing to have done,"" he adds. Cameron replies that ""of course"" that would have been a ""sensible"" thing to do, but there were several ""barriers"". He says bureaucracy was the first, that businesses would talk about the red tape they had faced in dealing with the NHS - but he adds that an element of bureaucracy is ""understandable"", given public money is involved. The second point, he says, is that ""there can be some resistance in the Treasury"" due to early payment having a ""cost to them"". He argues the third element is, in the case of NHS pharmacies, that ""they weren't being paid early, they were being paid before drugs were dispensed on the basis of being able to predict via an algorithm what the prescription history was"", and therefore that was ""a risk that government wouldn't want to take"". Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney asks about a financial product for pharmacists that was promoted by one of Lex Greensill's company's during Cameron's time as prime minister. The Pharmacy Early Payment Scheme saw banks reimburse pharmacists for providing NHS prescriptions, for a fee, before recovering the money from the government. Greensill Capital went on to provide funds for the scheme. But asked if there was a conflict of interest, Cameron says the contract was secured in a competitive tender after Greensill had left his government role. ""His firm didn't take over this contract for over six years... It seems to be an unfair argument,"" he says, adding it was as if ""I benefited from organising your marriage six years ago because today I have married your ex-partner"". ""OK, I think I understand,"" replies Olney. Reality Check For the second time today David Cameron is answering questions about his work for the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital. MPs, sitting on two committees, are investigating the way he lobbied ministers and former colleagues, which involved emails, texts and WhatsApp messages. Cameron said he has not broken any rules, but he admitted he should have used ""only the most formal"" means to lobby. For more,read our simple explainer.  Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says the ""question"" of a ""revolving door"" between public-sector and business jobs is ""of concern"". He asks what message his appointment by Greensill sent out to officials and ministers who were dealing with the firm at the time. Cameron says that he does ""understand the concern"", but there's an appointments process, and after you leave office it can be acceptable to take up a commercial role. Sir Bernard asks ""how appropriate it is"" for people to be dealing with companies they subsequently seek employment with. Cameron asks if someone works in the Treasury, should that exclude them from working in banking for 20 years? He says he believes reform of lobbying is right, but ""you have to be careful that what you do doesn't make it impossible"". Next up is Peter Grant of the SNP, who asks David Cameron why he specifically wanted to work for Greensill, just one of ""a number of organisations who might have been quite keen to recruit you"". Cameron says he met Lex Greensill after he left office and that Greensill told him about ""the business he had created and was growing"". The former PM says in additional to his pro bono charitable work he was looking to do some business work. He says: ""What I thought was interesting about Greensill was... going to big businesses and saying let us pay your supply chains immediately and then you pay us after 60 or 90 days and in the meantime we raise the money on the capital markets"". He says he liked that this approach was ""helping small businesses with cash flow"", and that to him, it was ""taking one thing that banks have done, and not always done well, and trying to make it better, cheaper, faster, digital, paperless"". Mr Cameron says Greensill was a ""UK fintech potential success story"" and that was what he thought was ""interesting"" about the firm. He adds that he thought about it for a long time and did some ""due diligence"" before joining. There has been much focus on how Greensill Capital's boss, Lex Greensill, came to work for the government as an unpaid adviser during David Cameron's tenure as prime minister. ""How did it all come about?"" Labour's Barry Gardiner asks. Cameron says Greensill was brought in by then Civil Service head Sir Jeremy Heywood who was keen to use outside consultants. ""I'm sure I was informed he was coming... but have not yet seen a paper trail for that,"" he tells the committee. But Cameron denies his relationship with Greensill became ""blurred"" during his time in office, saying he had very little contact with him. Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks if the Treasury was ""pessimistic"" about supply chain finance schemes. He says they mean the government ends up having to pay both the bill and interest. Cameron says NHS pharmacies were being paid immediately by Greensill, and Greensill was being paid by the NHS later, and therefore the Treasury was not directly involved. Cameron says some people think such schemes were ""pointless,"" but they have made a real difference to pharmacists. Reality Check David Cameron is speaking about government schemes to get money to
small businesses. Greensill Capital was involved in a scheme to make sure
companies were paid by government departments on time - what's known as supply
chain finance. But what is it and how does it work? One of the key problems in business, especially for smaller
companies, is delays in other companies paying you for your goods or services. The idea of supply chain finance is that a third company comes
in and lends you the money straight away, charging a fee for the service. When your customer pays the bill, that money goes to the lender
to pay off the debt. David Cameron was very enthusiastic about this in government andit was one
of the things that Greensill Capital was involved with,external. But there are concerns that this relatively simple process was
made more complicated by some of the companies using it and that it may have
hidden some of the cash-flow and debt problems that their customers were
having. Conservative Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks at what point he became aware of the use of supply chain finance in the public sector. Cameron says the late Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy (later Lord) Heywood was responsible for bringing it into government in 2011. The Public Accounts Committee's hearing is on rather technical issues. We'll remind you of what supply chain finance is in a bit. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, opens the second Q&A session of the day for David Cameron. She says she hopes the session will only last about an hour. The previous one, with the Treasury Committee, was rather longer. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent There was some Mrs Merton style questioning from
certain MPs  - âDo you not feel you have demeaned yourself and your position by
WhatsApping your way around Whitehall? It made for compelling and
sometimes cringe-worthy viewing. There were moments of drama in this
afternoon's session, but no big reveal. Will
members of the Public Accounts Committee extract any new information or admissions
from Mr Cameron? We'll see. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0065833

But he adds: ""We don't want a sort of Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors...Transparency is the key thing here."" Cameron points out the ministerial code was ""beefed up"" during his time in office, but accepts more could still be done. Richard Holden follows up, arguing that, although early payments ""would have a cost"" to the Treasury, it would be ""pretty small"". He adds that the ""bigger cost"" would have been the fact that pharmacies would have to factor in they would get less money, and would therefore charge more or push for higher prices for their products - so the ""real cost is to the taxpayer at the end of the day anyway"". Cameron says although he is not ""the world-leading expert on this"" he disagrees with Holden's assessment. ""If you've not got a good working capital solution, you have to go to the bank and borrow money, and that is going to be more expensive than the cash, less the discount, that you're getting from the supply chain finance provider"". He argues this is one of the ""key points to this whole argument"". Conservative Richard Holden asks Cameron why he could not just ""sort out the bureaucracy"" within the NHS, rather than bringing in a new financial product. ""Surely that would have been the most sensible thing to have done,"" he adds. Cameron replies that ""of course"" that would have been a ""sensible"" thing to do, but there were several ""barriers"". He says bureaucracy was the first, that businesses would talk about the red tape they had faced in dealing with the NHS - but he adds that an element of bureaucracy is ""understandable"", given public money is involved. The second point, he says, is that ""there can be some resistance in the Treasury"" due to early payment having a ""cost to them"". He argues the third element is, in the case of NHS pharmacies, that ""they weren't being paid early, they were being paid before drugs were dispensed on the basis of being able to predict via an algorithm what the prescription history was"", and therefore that was ""a risk that government wouldn't want to take"". Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney asks about a financial product for pharmacists that was promoted by one of Lex Greensill's company's during Cameron's time as prime minister. The Pharmacy Early Payment Scheme saw banks reimburse pharmacists for providing NHS prescriptions, for a fee, before recovering the money from the government. Greensill Capital went on to provide funds for the scheme. But asked if there was a conflict of interest, Cameron says the contract was secured in a competitive tender after Greensill had left his government role. ""His firm didn't take over this contract for over six years... It seems to be an unfair argument,"" he says, adding it was as if ""I benefited from organising your marriage six years ago because today I have married your ex-partner"". ""OK, I think I understand,"" replies Olney. Reality Check For the second time today David Cameron is answering questions about his work for the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital. MPs, sitting on two committees, are investigating the way he lobbied ministers and former colleagues, which involved emails, texts and WhatsApp messages. Cameron said he has not broken any rules, but he admitted he should have used ""only the most formal"" means to lobby. For more,read our simple explainer.  Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says the ""question"" of a ""revolving door"" between public-sector and business jobs is ""of concern"". He asks what message his appointment by Greensill sent out to officials and ministers who were dealing with the firm at the time. Cameron says that he does ""understand the concern"", but there's an appointments process, and after you leave office it can be acceptable to take up a commercial role. Sir Bernard asks ""how appropriate it is"" for people to be dealing with companies they subsequently seek employment with. Cameron asks if someone works in the Treasury, should that exclude them from working in banking for 20 years? He says he believes reform of lobbying is right, but ""you have to be careful that what you do doesn't make it impossible"". Next up is Peter Grant of the SNP, who asks David Cameron why he specifically wanted to work for Greensill, just one of ""a number of organisations who might have been quite keen to recruit you"". Cameron says he met Lex Greensill after he left office and that Greensill told him about ""the business he had created and was growing"". The former PM says in additional to his pro bono charitable work he was looking to do some business work. He says: ""What I thought was interesting about Greensill was... going to big businesses and saying let us pay your supply chains immediately and then you pay us after 60 or 90 days and in the meantime we raise the money on the capital markets"". He says he liked that this approach was ""helping small businesses with cash flow"", and that to him, it was ""taking one thing that banks have done, and not always done well, and trying to make it better, cheaper, faster, digital, paperless"". Mr Cameron says Greensill was a ""UK fintech potential success story"" and that was what he thought was ""interesting"" about the firm. He adds that he thought about it for a long time and did some ""due diligence"" before joining. There has been much focus on how Greensill Capital's boss, Lex Greensill, came to work for the government as an unpaid adviser during David Cameron's tenure as prime minister. ""How did it all come about?"" Labour's Barry Gardiner asks. Cameron says Greensill was brought in by then Civil Service head Sir Jeremy Heywood who was keen to use outside consultants. ""I'm sure I was informed he was coming... but have not yet seen a paper trail for that,"" he tells the committee. But Cameron denies his relationship with Greensill became ""blurred"" during his time in office, saying he had very little contact with him. Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks if the Treasury was ""pessimistic"" about supply chain finance schemes. He says they mean the government ends up having to pay both the bill and interest. Cameron says NHS pharmacies were being paid immediately by Greensill, and Greensill was being paid by the NHS later, and therefore the Treasury was not directly involved. Cameron says some people think such schemes were ""pointless,"" but they have made a real difference to pharmacists. Reality Check David Cameron is speaking about government schemes to get money to
small businesses. Greensill Capital was involved in a scheme to make sure
companies were paid by government departments on time - what's known as supply
chain finance. But what is it and how does it work? One of the key problems in business, especially for smaller
companies, is delays in other companies paying you for your goods or services. The idea of supply chain finance is that a third company comes
in and lends you the money straight away, charging a fee for the service. When your customer pays the bill, that money goes to the lender
to pay off the debt. David Cameron was very enthusiastic about this in government andit was one
of the things that Greensill Capital was involved with,external. But there are concerns that this relatively simple process was
made more complicated by some of the companies using it and that it may have
hidden some of the cash-flow and debt problems that their customers were
having. Conservative Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks at what point he became aware of the use of supply chain finance in the public sector. Cameron says the late Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy (later Lord) Heywood was responsible for bringing it into government in 2011. The Public Accounts Committee's hearing is on rather technical issues. We'll remind you of what supply chain finance is in a bit. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, opens the second Q&A session of the day for David Cameron. She says she hopes the session will only last about an hour. The previous one, with the Treasury Committee, was rather longer.

"David Cameron has appeared in front of two committees of MPs over his involvement with Greensill Capital He told the Public Accounts Committee he once thought the now defunct firm could be a UK ""success story"" The former PM added that he was not approached about working for it while in office Cameron gave evidence earlier to the Treasury Committee, which is also holding an inquiry MPs asked him about his work as an adviser for Greensill, which included texting current ministers Cameron said there had been ""absolutely no wrongdoing"" on his part He also revealed he had been paid ""a generous amount"" at Greensill - ""far more than"" his Â£150,402 salary as PM Alex Kleiderman, Richard Morris and Mary O'Connor Thank you for joining us for today's hearings. We're going to close the live page now, but please keep following all the reaction and latest updates on the BBC News website and the BBC News Channel. David Cameron's had a busy day in front of MPs. Here are the key points: Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier asks how David Cameron would like to be remembered. The former PM says he put together the first coalition in 70 years against the background of a ""very tricky"" economic situation. ""Do you regret the past few months?"" asks Ms Hillier. ""Well obviously it's been difficult for me,"" he replies, but he says he feels more sorry for people who worked at Greensill Capital and lost their jobs. ""There'll be lessons to learn. I'll be reading your committee report and the Treasury Committee's report,"" he says. With that, the committee session closes. Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin asks David Cameron what lessons the Public Accounts Committee should draw from this episode. Cameron replies that there's ""always work to be done"" on managing conflicts, transparency and the rules for what people do when they leave office. He cautions that, in doing this, the ability to access ""private sector skills"" and for there to be ""dialogue"" between the public and private sectors should not be lost. Conservative Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks if, with hindsight, David Cameron should have been more aware of the financial difficulties facing Greensill Capital. Cameron says he did not believe the company was in ""any severe financial difficulty"" in March and April 2020. He says founder Lex Greensill said himself that the company was only in difficulty in December 2020. Cameron adds that when he joined the company, he asked lots of questions and ""sought all kinds of answers"" about how it was operating. Committee chair Meg Hillier asks if David Cameron has disclosed all his contacts with government. Cameron says he has, but he would go away and double check them. Hillier, a Labour MP, asks how Greensill Capital, under its scheme, could afford to pay NHS staff early for no fee. Cameron says it wasn't an advance by Greensill, but the scheme was at a cost to the company. But he says the cost was ""relatively low"", especially as the NHS was going to continue paying staff. Hillier asks if Cameron was aware senior civil servant Bill Crothers had taken a role on with Greensill while still working in government. Cameron says he was ""surprised"", and was not aware. Tory MP Shaun Bailey focuses on the government's use of people working in the private sector. David Cameron says: ""Whenever you try to involve private-sector skills in the public sector and those people are maintaining private-sector roles there will always be difficulties."" He adds that there are inevitably questions about potential conflicts of interest. But he adds: ""We don't want a sort of Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors...Transparency is the key thing here.""

"Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning. And in-depth analysis by BBC News has found: nearly a third of hospitals have seen long waits balloon with over 10% of patients going a year without treatment major disruption to cancer services, with some hospitals struggling to treat half of their patients within the target time of two months concern growing for 45,000 ""missing cancer patients"", after drops in GP referrals and screening services across the UK It comes as NHS England has launched a Â£160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists. A network of ""accelerator"" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations NHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: ""With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services."" Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. The 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. But her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. It was ""the most horrendous day"", she says. ""Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk."" This video can not be played 'I might die because of surgery delays due to Covid' Elaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. She has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. ""I have got weaker,"" she says. ""I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now."" Elaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. And some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP. For University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half. It has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals. The trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally. Like others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now ""working hard"" to have patients diagnosed and treated. But it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services. About one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment. This reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising. Nonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 ""missing"" cancer patients. And the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival. ""The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,"" Steven McIntosh says. ""We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come."" Attempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward. But cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a ""monumental political effort"" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to ""super-boost"" services. ""Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,"" she adds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. Cancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations. Its report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. Cancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more. Overall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit. Outpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions The report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people. The consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments. In England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. A similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%. Most worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021. Nearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five. One of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says. It is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: ""Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely."" But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

"A man arrives for morning prayer in Kashgar, Xinjiang, a mostly Muslim region in north-western China China has imprisoned or detained at least 630 imams and other Muslim religious figures since 2014 in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, according to new research by a Uyghur rights group. The research, compiled by the Uyghur Human Rights Project and shared with the BBC, also found evidence that 18 clerics had died in detention or shortly after. Many of the detained clerics faced broad charges like ""propagating extremism"", ""gathering a crowd to disturb social order"", and ""inciting separatism"". According to testimony from relatives, the real crimes behind these charges are often things like preaching, convening prayer groups, or simply acting as an imam. The UHRP, working with rights group Justice for All, tracked the fates of 1,046 Muslim clerics â the vast majority of them Uyghurs â using court documents, family testimony and media reports from public and private databases. While all 1,046 clerics were reportedly detained at some point, in many cases corroborating evidence was not available because of China's tight control over information in the region. Among the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of ""re-education"" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs. Where information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences. A closed down mosque near Kashgar, with barbed wire and a surveillance camera in the foreground The database, which drew on research by the Uyghur activist Abduweli Ayup, as well as the Xinjiang Victims Database and Uyghur Transitional Justice Database, is by no means exhaustive â representing only a fraction of the total estimated number of imams in Xinjiang â and much of the data cannot be independently verified. But the research shines a light on the specific targeting of religious figures in Xinjiang, appearing to support allegations that China is attempting to break the religious traditions of the Uyghurs and assimilate them into Han Chinese culture. China denies those allegations, saying the purpose of its so-called ""re-education"" programme in Xinjiang is to stamp out extremism among the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. China is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China that is home to various ethnically Turkic peoples. The state has been accused of human rights abuses in the region, includingforced labour,sterilisationandrape. Most of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to ""re-education"" facilities â prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge. But others have been given formal prison sentences, the number and severity of which have increased dramatically since 2017. Publicly available detention or charging documents are rare, but those that do exist demonstrate how the state has worked to tie ordinary religious expression in Xinjiang to extremism or political separatism. According to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with ""propagating extremism"". According to testimony collated by theXinjiang Victims Database,external, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. Mahmet's initial detention notice says he was detained for ""inciting people to violate national laws pertaining to the reading of marriage vows, education, and public governance, as well as making and propagating items related to extremism"". His sentence was reportedly eight to 10 years. Oken Mahmut's detention notice. The final charge was ""propagating extremism"" (Xinjiang Victims Database) Baqythan Myrzan, a 58-year-old state-approved imam from Hami prefecture, was also arrested for ""propagating extremism"". Myrzan was detained in August 2018 and held at a detention facility until May 2019, when he was sentenced to 14 years at the Bingtuan Urumqi Prison. Myrzan's family says his only crime was going about his duties as an imam. And the only clues to the alleged offence committed by Abidin Ayup, a prominent scholar and imam from Atush city, were a few lines that appeared in a long court document from a separate case against a Han Chinese official. The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a ""religious extremist"". Ayup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a ""kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects"". Muhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children. An excerpt from a verdict against a Han official - the only clue to the charges against Abidin Ayup Extremism charges were being issued on a ""flimsy legal basis"" in Xinjiang for ""offences that shouldn't even qualify as offences"", said Donald Clarke, a professor at George Washington University who specialises in Chinese law. ""Setting to one side for a moment whether you accept 'propagating extremism' as a valid charge, the question is do the facts make a plausible case for that charge?"" he said. ""And the alleged offences we have seen â things like having a beard, not drinking, or travelling abroad â suggest they don't."" The real reason imams were being targeted was ""because of their ability to bring people together in the community"", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. ""The state has been carefully dealing with imams for a long time because it knows the influence they have,"" he said. ""The detentions and imprisonments of the past few years are just the culmination of three decades of repression designed to constrict Uyghur culture and religion."" A spokesman for the Chinese government told the BBC that Xinjiang ""enjoys unprecedented freedom of religious belief"". ""Xinjiang's 'de-radicalisation' effort has effectively contained the spread of religious extremism and made a great contribution to global 'de-radicalisation' efforts,"" he said. Abidin Ayup was detained in 2017. His family believes he is in a hospital detention facility Targeting of the Turkic ethnic groups in north-western China is not a new phenomenon. Muslim minorities suffered long periods of repression between the 1950s and 1970s, when Qurans were burned, mosques and cemeteries desecrated, and traditional dress and hair styles prohibited. The 1980s brought a period of relative openness and revival. Damaged mosques were repaired and new mosques built; religious festivals allowed and imams and other figures permitted to travel; and the Quran translated for the first time into Uyghur, by the prominent Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim. But a violent uprising by Uyghur militants in 1990, in the town of Baren in Xinjiang, precipitated a crackdown by the Chinese state and the beginning of a two-decade period of gradually tightening control. Imams, seen by authorities as influential community figures, were increasingly required to demonstrate loyalty to the state. In the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass ""re-education"" programmes pursued today against the general population. According to Human Rights Watch, roughly 16,000 imams and other religious figures underwent ""political re-education"" between 2001 and 2002. Among them was Tursun, an imam who was first detained in 2001 for translating prayers from Arabic into Uyghur for his congregation, according to his niece. Chinese soldiers outside the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, where an imam was killed by assailants in 2014 Tursun's two-year stint in a ""re-education through labour"" camp marked the beginning of a two-decade ordeal at the hands of the state, his niece told the BBC from outside China. Her uncle was freed from the labour camp in 2002 but constantly harassed by police, she said, and frequently taken away again for two-week periods of ""study"". Then in 2005, he was detained again but this time sentenced to four years in prison. ""We were not given any notice from the court,"" his niece said. ""My family went to the police station to enquire about his fate and the police gave them a handwritten note containing information about his prison sentence and the address of the prison."" Tursun was released from prison in 2009, only to be detained again in 2017 after the hardline politician Chen Quanguo was put in charge of Xinjiang and escalated the campaign against the Uyghurs. As appears to be the case with other imams in the region, Tursun's family was subsequently targeted en masse, said his niece, who had left China by that time. ""After I heard the news of my uncle and his wife's arrests, I heard that my mother and many of my relatives were also arrested. Anyone over 14 was taken away,"" she said. ""For the last four years I have been trying to find information regarding their whereabouts, especially my mother."" ""Propagating extremism"" is a common charge levied against imams, for a variety of perceived offences About a month ago, Tursun's niece learned that her mother had been sentenced to 13 years in prison and her younger brother to five years. She doesn't know what the charges were. Her father is already serving a life sentence, she said, issued in 2008 for ""illegal preaching"" and ""separatism"". ""My mother was a simple housewife and she was sentenced to 13 years,"" she said. ""I cannot imagine how long my uncle has been sent to prison for."" They were targeted ""because of their invisible authority"", she added. ""The state has tried everything to break them, to destroy them. And not only the religious leaders but also those who practise Islam quietly, and take pride in being Uyghur. They have made every effort to dig them out and destroy them."" Some that disappear into detention never come out. Eighteen imams named in the database were reported to have died while in custody or shortly after. Nurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. Unconfirmed reports say Chinese authorities acknowledged his death to his family, but did not produce a body â a situation echoed in other, similar reports. Malik's friends and relatives held a funeral for him in Kazakhstan all the same. Uyghur men pray at an open air mosque in old Kashgar, Xinjiang, in 2014 In late 2019, as its network of ""re-education"" camps drew intense international scrutiny, China claimed it had released everyone from the system. Significant numbers had been released, into house arrest or into the otherwise controlled environment of Xinjiang, but rights groups say many were simply transferred to formal prisons. There is also evidence that many thousands had been in prison all along. Incarceration rates exploded in Xinjiang in 2017 and 2018, according to reporting by theNew York Times,externaland others, sweeping up at least 230,000 people â about 200,000 more than in previous years. According to Chinese government data, criminal arrests in Xinjiang accounted for 21% of the country's total in 2017, despite the region having about 1.5% of the population. Unlike the ""re-education"" system, formal prison sentences should create a paper trail. But the court documents are ""nowhere to be found"",according to Gene Bunin,external, the researcher behind the Xinjiang Victims Database. According to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like ""propagating extremism"" and ""inciting separatism"", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record. Where official documents are available and contain details, offences can be shocking in their innocuity. Experts say about 16,000 mosques have been destroyed in Xinjiang â two thirds of the total In one 2018 verdict, now deleted from the government records but archived by the Xinjiang Victims Database, a 55-year-old Uyghur farmer already serving 10 years for ""propagating extremism"" had his sentence doubled after he ""used a disguised and simplified method to perform the namaz prayer in the prison dormitory"". Essentially, Ismayil Sidiq secretly prayed in prison. He was reported by a cellmate and charged with ""illegal religious activities"" and ""inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination"" â the latter charge for allegedly shouting that Uyghurs should not inform on one another. He will be eligible for release in 2038. Those who are detained in camps stand a better chance of release after a few months or years, but release in Xinjiang does not necessarily mean freedom. Memet, a Uyghur who fled Xinjiang, told the BBC his father was detained in 2017 after many years serving peacefully as an imam. Memet had been able to learn news of his family over the years from an acquaintance in Xinjiang â someone distant enough from the family that she felt safe messaging abroad from her WeChat account â but Memet heard virtually no news of his father's condition for four years. Then recently he heard his father had been released, and Memet imagined speaking to him for the first time in years. He asked the family acquaintance if she would be willing to find his father and connect them again via her phone. On the appointed day, Memet received a message on his WeChat account from the acquaintance. She said she had found his father, but he had told her it would be better if he didn't speak to his son. And after she sent the message, she blocked Memet from contacting her again. Some names have been changed.

"This video can not be played Israeli Arabs clashed with police in a number of Israeli cities Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired dozens of rockets at Israel after its air strikes killed top commanders and felled another tower block there. The escalation, which began on Monday, has triggered street violence in Israel between Jews and Israeli Arabs. In two incidents, a Jewish man in Acre was attacked by Arab men, while in Bat Yam Jews pulled a Palestinian out of his car and beat him up. At least 67 people in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed. The fighting erupted on Monday after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence in Israel Children terrified as locals scramble for cover Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Israel-Gaza violence dominates Arab media More than 374 people were arrested and 36 officers were injured after clashes in Israeli cities, Israeli police said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking late on Wednesday night, said he planned to send in military forces to help police maintain order in cities ruptured by violence. Mr Netanyahu said the attacks in recent days amounted to ""anarchy"". ""Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs,"" he said in a video statement, as reported by the Times of Israel. Violent clashes continued in the town of Lod on Wednesday An Arab driver was attacked by a mob in the city of Bat Yam on Wednesday Militant groups in Gaza, run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, have been firing rockets into Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in the territory. On Thursday morning, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said about 1,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli cities since hostilities escalated at the start of this week. The health ministry in Gaza says that more than 400 people have been injured there since the conflict began, in addition to the 67 who have died. Mr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside. But the Palestinian Authority, which governs in parts of the West Bank,condemned Israel's ""military aggression"" in a tweet,external, saying it was ""traumatising an already beleaguered population of two million people"". The militants in Gaza said they had fired 130 rockets into Israel in response to an Israeli air raid which destroyed the al-Sharouk tower in Gaza City. The tower, which is the third tall building to be destroyed by air strikes this week, housed al-Aqsa TV, the station run by Hamas. This woman and child were evacuated from a building in Gaza Israel said it had killed senior Hamas officials in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. Hamas confirmed a senior commander and ""other leaders"" had died. The IDF said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014. Residents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths. Five members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency. ""We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,"" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death. The strength and limitations of Hamas's arsenal Meanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening,according to the IDF,external, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country. Anna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby. ""To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,"" she told the BBC. A child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system - seen here over Ashkelon - aims to protect towns and cities from rockets United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore ""a sustainable calm"". ""My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,"" he told reporters at the White House. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides. Russia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia). A Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped ""violent acts"" in East Jerusalem and ""illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents"". The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries.

"This video can not be played Israeli ground troops are massing on the border with Gaza after another night of violence Israel has deployed tanks and troops to its border with Gaza, as it mulls whether to launch a ground operation in the territory after days of violence. Conflict raged throughout Thursday as Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli army maintained a barrage of air strikes. More than 100 people have been killed in Gaza and seven have died in Israel. Jewish and Israeli Arab mobs have also been fighting within Israel, prompting the president to warn of civil war. Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a ""massive reinforcement"" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest, and more than 400 people were arrested. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence Conflict cools warming of Arab-Israel ties Who are Hamas? Two infantry units and one armoured unit were positioned near the border with Gaza on Thursday. At least 7,000 army reservists have also been called up. No decision has yet been made on whether to launch a ground operation. The Israeli army is expected to put forward plans for a possible offensive imminently, but it would need to be approved by army chiefs and various levels of government. Israel deployed additional troops to its border with Gaza on Thursday The four-days of violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It was initially fuelled by weeks of Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which led to clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. This spiralled into an incessant exchange of Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes. In other developments on Thursday: Three rockets were fired from Lebanon into the sea off the coast of northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. No group said they were responsible, but several militant groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 Israel's military said it had hit targets in Gaza that included intelligence buildings and homes and businesses used by militants The Palestinian militant group Hamas, meanwhile, fired further barrages of rockets towards Israel from Gaza, and a spokesman for the group said it had shown ""only a small part"" of its capabilities Further violence broke out between Jewish and Israeli Arab groups in mixed towns and cities within Israel International airlines, including KLM, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended services to Israel. Incoming flights were also diverted south from Tel Aviv's main airport According to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 103 people have been killed in the four-days of conflict. Officials in the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, many civilians have died including 27 children. Israel says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza. In the Israeli city of Sderot, a young boy was killed when rocket fire from Gaza hit his home, and shrapnel penetrated the shelter he was hiding in. Israel has also called up 10 reserve border patrol companies to help tackle the worst unrest between Arab and Jewish communities for many years. Political leaders have appealed for calm, and President Reuven Rivlin described the outbreaks of rioting in several towns and cities as ""senseless civil war"". There have been widespread calls for de-escalation, including from Israel's ally the US, but little sign of the conflict easing. A senior Hamas official said the group was ready for a ""reciprocal"" ceasefire if the international community pressures Israel to ""suppress military actions"" at the disputed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. However, Israeli military spokesman Hilda Zilberman said Israel was not seeking a ceasefire at the current time, the Times of Israel reported. The fear among civilians on both sides is taking its toll. Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad, a Gaza mother, said of Wednesday night: ""You cannot sleep... In any moment your home might be your grave. ""You cannot be secure. As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. This video can not be played BBC reporters are on the ground in Gaza, Lod and Jerusalem In Israel, an apartment block was destroyed in the city of Petah Tikva shortly after residents had gone to their bomb shelters. ""We heard an alarm and suddenly there was a bang. Smoke entered the shelter, and the neighbour next to me who was sitting on a chair flew back,"" one resident told the news website Ynet.

During the war that surrounded the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Arabs were forced from or fled their homes. Those who stayed in what became Israel, and their descendants, have been granted citizenship and are known as Israeli Arabs. About 80% of Israeli Arabs are Muslim, with the rest identifying as either Christian or Druze. Most identify strongly with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, with many calling themselves ""Palestinian citizens of Israel"". Israel's government says its Arab citizens have equal social and political rights, although they are exempt from compulsory military service.

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system.

operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike.

Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence.

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago.

"This video can not be played Israeli Arabs clashed with police in a number of Israeli cities Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired dozens of rockets at Israel after its air strikes killed top commanders and felled another tower block there. The escalation, which began on Monday, has triggered street violence in Israel between Jews and Israeli Arabs. In two incidents, a Jewish man in Acre was attacked by Arab men, while in Bat Yam Jews pulled a Palestinian out of his car and beat him up. At least 67 people in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed. The fighting erupted on Monday after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence in Israel Children terrified as locals scramble for cover Jeremy Bowen: Old grievances fuel new fighting Israel-Gaza violence dominates Arab media More than 374 people were arrested and 36 officers were injured after clashes in Israeli cities, Israeli police said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking late on Wednesday night, said he planned to send in military forces to help police maintain order in cities ruptured by violence. Mr Netanyahu said the attacks in recent days amounted to ""anarchy"". ""Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs,"" he said in a video statement, as reported by the Times of Israel. Violent clashes continued in the town of Lod on Wednesday An Arab driver was attacked by a mob in the city of Bat Yam on Wednesday Militant groups in Gaza, run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, have been firing rockets into Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in the territory. On Thursday morning, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said about 1,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli cities since hostilities escalated at the start of this week. The health ministry in Gaza says that more than 400 people have been injured there since the conflict began, in addition to the 67 who have died. Mr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside. But the Palestinian Authority, which governs in parts of the West Bank,condemned Israel's ""military aggression"" in a tweet,external, saying it was ""traumatising an already beleaguered population of two million people"". The militants in Gaza said they had fired 130 rockets into Israel in response to an Israeli air raid which destroyed the al-Sharouk tower in Gaza City. The tower, which is the third tall building to be destroyed by air strikes this week, housed al-Aqsa TV, the station run by Hamas. This woman and child were evacuated from a building in Gaza Israel said it had killed senior Hamas officials in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. Hamas confirmed a senior commander and ""other leaders"" had died. The IDF said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014. Residents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths. Five members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency. ""We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,"" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death. The strength and limitations of Hamas's arsenal Meanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening,according to the IDF,external, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country. Anna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby. ""To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,"" she told the BBC. A child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system - seen here over Ashkelon - aims to protect towns and cities from rockets United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore ""a sustainable calm"". ""My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,"" he told reporters at the White House. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides. Russia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia). A Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped ""violent acts"" in East Jerusalem and ""illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents"". The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties.

Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The current live TV rights are held by Sky, BT and Amazon, while the BBC has shown Premier League games live during the pandemic with fans unable to attend matches The Premier League has agreed to roll over its existing television deal with broadcasters for a further three years. The new deal with Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and BBC Sport will run from 2022 to 2025. The current Â£4.7bn deal, agreed in 2018, represented a 10% drop in value. The Government has approved the deal ""in principle"" with an ""exclusion order"" under the competition act, which allows the league to renew without its normal tender process. ""In light of the damaging impact of the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the English football pyramid, the Premier League was able to demonstrate to Government exceptional and compelling reasons for the Exclusion Order,"" the league said. As part of the new deal, BT Sport say that to help with the fixture congestion, they will change their Saturday lunchtime game to an evening slot when teams involved have played in Europe on the previous Wednesday. Clubs had been concerned that there could be another fall in value if the usual open-market auction started as planned next month. The value of rights for domestic leagues in Europe also appears to have peaked. The Premier League say that the renewals will provide financial certainty to professional clubs and also enables an additional Â£100m of funding to be provided to clubs throughout the football pyramid over the next four years. The extra funding will be available to more than 1,000 clubs in the National League system, women's and girls' football, EFL League One and League Two clubs and the Football Foundation. It will also support a number of football-wide projects, including the Premier League's work looking at head injuries in football, anti-discrimination and fan groups. The EFL said it ""welcomes"" the increased funding but warned: ""It is important to acknowledge that the current media rights deal will preserve the status quo of an unbalanced, unsustainable, and unfair financial distribution model across English football. ""While we recognise the attempts by the government to increase the level of solidarity provided to League One and Two clubs through this process, what is more urgently required is a fundamental reset of the game's financial model - both in terms of fairer distribution of monies at all levels and sensible, realistic cost control measures to ensure clubs will live within their means."" ""Covid-19 has had a significant impact on football, and renewals with our UK broadcast partners will reduce uncertainty, generate stability and promote confidence within the football pyramid,"" said Premier League chief executive Richard Masters. ""We know that, once concluded, this will have a positive impact on the wider industry, jobs and tax revenues."" The Football Association has welcomed the extra Â£100m of funding which chief executive Mark Bullingham says will ""help the pyramid get back on its feet."" David Kogan, the former Premier League rights executive, said the government's involvement in the deal was a ""really marked difference in the way football's been run in the past"". He told BBC Radio 4's The Today programme: ""This will buy the Premier League three years of some peace."" Sky Sports and BT both said the deal was good news for its viewers.

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis had told families the PM would write to them Relatives of the Ballymurphy victims have spoken of their anger over a written apology from the prime minister. Aninquest has found10 people, who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast, were ""entirely innocent"". Families received the letter from Boris Johnson on Thursday morning. John Teggart, whose father Daniel was among the victims, said the tone and timing of the apology was unacceptable. He said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for ""the events at Ballymurphy"" in 1971. John Teggart (centre) made a statement on behalf of the families on Thursday afternoon In a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: ""The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger."" He added: ""It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. ""We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing."" Mr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. ""The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable. ""We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved."" Mr Teggart said the next step was to make ""somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones"". Janet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson ""didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself"". ""If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself."" Carmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words ""the events"" to describe what happened. Carmel Quinn, whose brother John Laverty was killed, expressed her anger at the PM's wording ""It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,"" she said. In his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government ""profoundly regrets and is truly sorry"" for what happened in Ballymurphy. He said this also extended to the families for the ""additional pain"" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled. This video can not be played 'Do this right - we want Boris Johnson at despatch box' Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like ""second class citizens"" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement. ""Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?"" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. ""Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris."" Ballymurphy: Who were the victims? 'Entirely innocent': What happened at Ballymurphy? Mr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families. He said there was ""no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles"". ""This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,"" Mr Lewis said. On Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call. However, on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call. Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during a phone call with the first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday Speaking of his subsequent letter, she added: ""A second hand apology is no apology at all."" Ms McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown ""courage, dignity, resilience and stamina"". ""I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here."" But some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public. On Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted ""to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt"" caused to the Ballymurphy families. Briege Voyle and John Teggart, whose relatives were killed in Ballymurphy, watch the NI secretary deliver his address Among the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two. Nine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. However, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr. Mr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. ""The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,"" Mr Lewis said. ""Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth."" Brandon Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened He added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was ""strong and legitimate"". ""Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,"" he said. ""We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future."" A number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. The Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister ""apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed"". Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a ""profound failure of justice"". ""In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,"" she said. ""Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not ""suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty"". The government is tobring forward legislation in the course of the next yearto deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Based on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations. Mr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that ""we get to the heart of what happened"". Amnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles. There has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed. But it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Not just future cases, but potentially, those already in train. It would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Initial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups. Sources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. The plan has been met with loud opposition. Already, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless. The legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved. But they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions. The government believes this is the key. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were ""sheer bloody murder"". ""Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?"" Mr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the ""courage and dignity"" of the families affected. ""Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?"" he asked. Denis Bradley, co-author of theConsultative Group on the Past Report,externalin 2009, said a statute of limitations was ""possibly workable"" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a ""hierarchy"" for victims. ""For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,"" he told BBC News NI's The View programme. Mr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy. On Thursday, he said the criminal justice system ""is not the place to do the past"". ""The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,"" he added. Mr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was ""information"" rather than court proceedings. PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971 Ballymurphy: Who were the victims?

"Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning. And in-depth analysis by BBC News has found: nearly a third of hospitals have seen long waits balloon with over 10% of patients going a year without treatment major disruption to cancer services, with some hospitals struggling to treat half of their patients within the target time of two months concern growing for 45,000 ""missing cancer patients"", after drops in GP referrals and screening services across the UK It comes as NHS England has launched a Â£160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists. A network of ""accelerator"" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations NHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: ""With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services."" Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. The 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. But her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. It was ""the most horrendous day"", she says. ""Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk."" This video can not be played 'I might die because of surgery delays due to Covid' Elaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. She has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. ""I have got weaker,"" she says. ""I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now."" Elaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. And some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP. For University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half. It has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals. The trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally. Like others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now ""working hard"" to have patients diagnosed and treated. But it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services. About one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment. This reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising. Nonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 ""missing"" cancer patients. And the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival. ""The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,"" Steven McIntosh says. ""We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come."" Attempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward. But cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a ""monumental political effort"" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to ""super-boost"" services. ""Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,"" she adds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. Cancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations. Its report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. Cancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more. Overall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit. Outpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions The report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people. The consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments. In England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. A similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%. Most worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021. Nearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five. One of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says. It is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: ""Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely."" But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis had told families the PM would write to them Relatives of the Ballymurphy victims have spoken of their anger over a written apology from the prime minister. Aninquest has found10 people, who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast, were ""entirely innocent"". Families received the letter from Boris Johnson on Thursday morning. John Teggart, whose father Daniel was among the victims, said the tone and timing of the apology was unacceptable. He said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for ""the events at Ballymurphy"" in 1971. John Teggart (centre) made a statement on behalf of the families on Thursday afternoon In a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: ""The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger."" He added: ""It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. ""We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing."" Mr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. ""The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable. ""We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved."" Mr Teggart said the next step was to make ""somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones"". Janet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson ""didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself"". ""If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself."" Carmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words ""the events"" to describe what happened. Carmel Quinn, whose brother John Laverty was killed, expressed her anger at the PM's wording ""It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,"" she said. In his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government ""profoundly regrets and is truly sorry"" for what happened in Ballymurphy. He said this also extended to the families for the ""additional pain"" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled. This video can not be played 'Do this right - we want Boris Johnson at despatch box' Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like ""second class citizens"" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement. ""Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?"" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. ""Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris."" Ballymurphy: Who were the victims? 'Entirely innocent': What happened at Ballymurphy? Mr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families. He said there was ""no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles"". ""This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,"" Mr Lewis said. On Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call. However, on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call. Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during a phone call with the first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday Speaking of his subsequent letter, she added: ""A second hand apology is no apology at all."" Ms McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown ""courage, dignity, resilience and stamina"". ""I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here."" But some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public. On Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted ""to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt"" caused to the Ballymurphy families. Briege Voyle and John Teggart, whose relatives were killed in Ballymurphy, watch the NI secretary deliver his address Among the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two. Nine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. However, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr. Mr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. ""The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,"" Mr Lewis said. ""Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth."" Brandon Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened He added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was ""strong and legitimate"". ""Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,"" he said. ""We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future."" A number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. The Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister ""apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed"". Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a ""profound failure of justice"". ""In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,"" she said. ""Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not ""suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty"". The government is tobring forward legislation in the course of the next yearto deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Based on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations. Mr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that ""we get to the heart of what happened"". Amnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles. There has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed. But it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Not just future cases, but potentially, those already in train. It would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Initial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups. Sources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. The plan has been met with loud opposition. Already, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless. The legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved. But they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions. The government believes this is the key. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were ""sheer bloody murder"". ""Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?"" Mr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the ""courage and dignity"" of the families affected. ""Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?"" he asked. Denis Bradley, co-author of theConsultative Group on the Past Report,externalin 2009, said a statute of limitations was ""possibly workable"" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a ""hierarchy"" for victims. ""For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,"" he told BBC News NI's The View programme. Mr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy. On Thursday, he said the criminal justice system ""is not the place to do the past"". ""The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,"" he added. Mr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was ""information"" rather than court proceedings. PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971 Ballymurphy: Who were the victims?

"A man arrives for morning prayer in Kashgar, Xinjiang, a mostly Muslim region in north-western China China has imprisoned or detained at least 630 imams and other Muslim religious figures since 2014 in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, according to new research by a Uyghur rights group. The research, compiled by the Uyghur Human Rights Project and shared with the BBC, also found evidence that 18 clerics had died in detention or shortly after. Many of the detained clerics faced broad charges like ""propagating extremism"", ""gathering a crowd to disturb social order"", and ""inciting separatism"". According to testimony from relatives, the real crimes behind these charges are often things like preaching, convening prayer groups, or simply acting as an imam. The UHRP, working with rights group Justice for All, tracked the fates of 1,046 Muslim clerics â the vast majority of them Uyghurs â using court documents, family testimony and media reports from public and private databases. While all 1,046 clerics were reportedly detained at some point, in many cases corroborating evidence was not available because of China's tight control over information in the region. Among the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of ""re-education"" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs. Where information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences. A closed down mosque near Kashgar, with barbed wire and a surveillance camera in the foreground The database, which drew on research by the Uyghur activist Abduweli Ayup, as well as the Xinjiang Victims Database and Uyghur Transitional Justice Database, is by no means exhaustive â representing only a fraction of the total estimated number of imams in Xinjiang â and much of the data cannot be independently verified. But the research shines a light on the specific targeting of religious figures in Xinjiang, appearing to support allegations that China is attempting to break the religious traditions of the Uyghurs and assimilate them into Han Chinese culture. China denies those allegations, saying the purpose of its so-called ""re-education"" programme in Xinjiang is to stamp out extremism among the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. China is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China that is home to various ethnically Turkic peoples. The state has been accused of human rights abuses in the region, includingforced labour,sterilisationandrape. Most of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to ""re-education"" facilities â prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge. But others have been given formal prison sentences, the number and severity of which have increased dramatically since 2017. Publicly available detention or charging documents are rare, but those that do exist demonstrate how the state has worked to tie ordinary religious expression in Xinjiang to extremism or political separatism. According to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with ""propagating extremism"". According to testimony collated by theXinjiang Victims Database,external, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. Mahmet's initial detention notice says he was detained for ""inciting people to violate national laws pertaining to the reading of marriage vows, education, and public governance, as well as making and propagating items related to extremism"". His sentence was reportedly eight to 10 years. Oken Mahmut's detention notice. The final charge was ""propagating extremism"" (Xinjiang Victims Database) Baqythan Myrzan, a 58-year-old state-approved imam from Hami prefecture, was also arrested for ""propagating extremism"". Myrzan was detained in August 2018 and held at a detention facility until May 2019, when he was sentenced to 14 years at the Bingtuan Urumqi Prison. Myrzan's family says his only crime was going about his duties as an imam. And the only clues to the alleged offence committed by Abidin Ayup, a prominent scholar and imam from Atush city, were a few lines that appeared in a long court document from a separate case against a Han Chinese official. The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a ""religious extremist"". Ayup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a ""kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects"". Muhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children. An excerpt from a verdict against a Han official - the only clue to the charges against Abidin Ayup Extremism charges were being issued on a ""flimsy legal basis"" in Xinjiang for ""offences that shouldn't even qualify as offences"", said Donald Clarke, a professor at George Washington University who specialises in Chinese law. ""Setting to one side for a moment whether you accept 'propagating extremism' as a valid charge, the question is do the facts make a plausible case for that charge?"" he said. ""And the alleged offences we have seen â things like having a beard, not drinking, or travelling abroad â suggest they don't."" The real reason imams were being targeted was ""because of their ability to bring people together in the community"", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. ""The state has been carefully dealing with imams for a long time because it knows the influence they have,"" he said. ""The detentions and imprisonments of the past few years are just the culmination of three decades of repression designed to constrict Uyghur culture and religion."" A spokesman for the Chinese government told the BBC that Xinjiang ""enjoys unprecedented freedom of religious belief"". ""Xinjiang's 'de-radicalisation' effort has effectively contained the spread of religious extremism and made a great contribution to global 'de-radicalisation' efforts,"" he said. Abidin Ayup was detained in 2017. His family believes he is in a hospital detention facility Targeting of the Turkic ethnic groups in north-western China is not a new phenomenon. Muslim minorities suffered long periods of repression between the 1950s and 1970s, when Qurans were burned, mosques and cemeteries desecrated, and traditional dress and hair styles prohibited. The 1980s brought a period of relative openness and revival. Damaged mosques were repaired and new mosques built; religious festivals allowed and imams and other figures permitted to travel; and the Quran translated for the first time into Uyghur, by the prominent Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim. But a violent uprising by Uyghur militants in 1990, in the town of Baren in Xinjiang, precipitated a crackdown by the Chinese state and the beginning of a two-decade period of gradually tightening control. Imams, seen by authorities as influential community figures, were increasingly required to demonstrate loyalty to the state. In the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass ""re-education"" programmes pursued today against the general population. According to Human Rights Watch, roughly 16,000 imams and other religious figures underwent ""political re-education"" between 2001 and 2002. Among them was Tursun, an imam who was first detained in 2001 for translating prayers from Arabic into Uyghur for his congregation, according to his niece. Chinese soldiers outside the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, where an imam was killed by assailants in 2014 Tursun's two-year stint in a ""re-education through labour"" camp marked the beginning of a two-decade ordeal at the hands of the state, his niece told the BBC from outside China. Her uncle was freed from the labour camp in 2002 but constantly harassed by police, she said, and frequently taken away again for two-week periods of ""study"". Then in 2005, he was detained again but this time sentenced to four years in prison. ""We were not given any notice from the court,"" his niece said. ""My family went to the police station to enquire about his fate and the police gave them a handwritten note containing information about his prison sentence and the address of the prison."" Tursun was released from prison in 2009, only to be detained again in 2017 after the hardline politician Chen Quanguo was put in charge of Xinjiang and escalated the campaign against the Uyghurs. As appears to be the case with other imams in the region, Tursun's family was subsequently targeted en masse, said his niece, who had left China by that time. ""After I heard the news of my uncle and his wife's arrests, I heard that my mother and many of my relatives were also arrested. Anyone over 14 was taken away,"" she said. ""For the last four years I have been trying to find information regarding their whereabouts, especially my mother."" ""Propagating extremism"" is a common charge levied against imams, for a variety of perceived offences About a month ago, Tursun's niece learned that her mother had been sentenced to 13 years in prison and her younger brother to five years. She doesn't know what the charges were. Her father is already serving a life sentence, she said, issued in 2008 for ""illegal preaching"" and ""separatism"". ""My mother was a simple housewife and she was sentenced to 13 years,"" she said. ""I cannot imagine how long my uncle has been sent to prison for."" They were targeted ""because of their invisible authority"", she added. ""The state has tried everything to break them, to destroy them. And not only the religious leaders but also those who practise Islam quietly, and take pride in being Uyghur. They have made every effort to dig them out and destroy them."" Some that disappear into detention never come out. Eighteen imams named in the database were reported to have died while in custody or shortly after. Nurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. Unconfirmed reports say Chinese authorities acknowledged his death to his family, but did not produce a body â a situation echoed in other, similar reports. Malik's friends and relatives held a funeral for him in Kazakhstan all the same. Uyghur men pray at an open air mosque in old Kashgar, Xinjiang, in 2014 In late 2019, as its network of ""re-education"" camps drew intense international scrutiny, China claimed it had released everyone from the system. Significant numbers had been released, into house arrest or into the otherwise controlled environment of Xinjiang, but rights groups say many were simply transferred to formal prisons. There is also evidence that many thousands had been in prison all along. Incarceration rates exploded in Xinjiang in 2017 and 2018, according to reporting by theNew York Times,externaland others, sweeping up at least 230,000 people â about 200,000 more than in previous years. According to Chinese government data, criminal arrests in Xinjiang accounted for 21% of the country's total in 2017, despite the region having about 1.5% of the population. Unlike the ""re-education"" system, formal prison sentences should create a paper trail. But the court documents are ""nowhere to be found"",according to Gene Bunin,external, the researcher behind the Xinjiang Victims Database. According to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like ""propagating extremism"" and ""inciting separatism"", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record. Where official documents are available and contain details, offences can be shocking in their innocuity. Experts say about 16,000 mosques have been destroyed in Xinjiang â two thirds of the total In one 2018 verdict, now deleted from the government records but archived by the Xinjiang Victims Database, a 55-year-old Uyghur farmer already serving 10 years for ""propagating extremism"" had his sentence doubled after he ""used a disguised and simplified method to perform the namaz prayer in the prison dormitory"". Essentially, Ismayil Sidiq secretly prayed in prison. He was reported by a cellmate and charged with ""illegal religious activities"" and ""inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination"" â the latter charge for allegedly shouting that Uyghurs should not inform on one another. He will be eligible for release in 2038. Those who are detained in camps stand a better chance of release after a few months or years, but release in Xinjiang does not necessarily mean freedom. Memet, a Uyghur who fled Xinjiang, told the BBC his father was detained in 2017 after many years serving peacefully as an imam. Memet had been able to learn news of his family over the years from an acquaintance in Xinjiang â someone distant enough from the family that she felt safe messaging abroad from her WeChat account â but Memet heard virtually no news of his father's condition for four years. Then recently he heard his father had been released, and Memet imagined speaking to him for the first time in years. He asked the family acquaintance if she would be willing to find his father and connect them again via her phone. On the appointed day, Memet received a message on his WeChat account from the acquaintance. She said she had found his father, but he had told her it would be better if he didn't speak to his son. And after she sent the message, she blocked Memet from contacting her again. Some names have been changed.

The world-famous London landmark relies almost entirely on tourist income from ticket sales and has seen its finances devastated by the pandemic. The building's income dropped by 90% in 2020 as it remained shut. There has been a similar fall so far this year. Dean of St Paul's, the Very Rev Dr David Ison, said ""big decisions"" were needed for the historic building. St Paul's is facing its worst financial crisis in 300 years, according to those who run it.

""If we can't raise the resources to be able to employ the people to look after the building and pay for the heating and lighting, we would have to shut our doors,"" he said. Nearly all the cathedral's reserves have been spent and although some staff have been furloughed, a restructure has seen almost 25% made redundant.

Alongside 30 choirboys, it is made up of 12 professional singers who provide the different ranges enabling the choir to sing its repertoire.

One critical project which has been cancelled is the replacement of large sections of the 7,000 sq m (75,300 sq ft) lead roof, some of which dates back to the time of Sir Christopher Wren, the architect of the cathedral. In March 2020, at the same time as when the pandemic hit, a Â£15m programme of works to replace the ageing lead roof was about to be put out to tender. But that has been cancelled as the money set aside for the project has been spent to keep the cathedral afloat.

"The current live TV rights are held by Sky, BT and Amazon, while the BBC has shown Premier League games live during the pandemic with fans unable to attend matches The Premier League has agreed to roll over its existing television deal with broadcasters for a further three years. The new deal with Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and BBC Sport will run from 2022 to 2025. The current Â£4.7bn deal, agreed in 2018, represented a 10% drop in value. The Government has approved the deal ""in principle"" with an ""exclusion order"" under the competition act, which allows the league to renew without its normal tender process. ""In light of the damaging impact of the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the English football pyramid, the Premier League was able to demonstrate to Government exceptional and compelling reasons for the Exclusion Order,"" the league said. As part of the new deal, BT Sport say that to help with the fixture congestion, they will change their Saturday lunchtime game to an evening slot when teams involved have played in Europe on the previous Wednesday. Clubs had been concerned that there could be another fall in value if the usual open-market auction started as planned next month. The value of rights for domestic leagues in Europe also appears to have peaked. The Premier League say that the renewals will provide financial certainty to professional clubs and also enables an additional Â£100m of funding to be provided to clubs throughout the football pyramid over the next four years. The extra funding will be available to more than 1,000 clubs in the National League system, women's and girls' football, EFL League One and League Two clubs and the Football Foundation. It will also support a number of football-wide projects, including the Premier League's work looking at head injuries in football, anti-discrimination and fan groups. The EFL said it ""welcomes"" the increased funding but warned: ""It is important to acknowledge that the current media rights deal will preserve the status quo of an unbalanced, unsustainable, and unfair financial distribution model across English football. ""While we recognise the attempts by the government to increase the level of solidarity provided to League One and Two clubs through this process, what is more urgently required is a fundamental reset of the game's financial model - both in terms of fairer distribution of monies at all levels and sensible, realistic cost control measures to ensure clubs will live within their means."" ""Covid-19 has had a significant impact on football, and renewals with our UK broadcast partners will reduce uncertainty, generate stability and promote confidence within the football pyramid,"" said Premier League chief executive Richard Masters. ""We know that, once concluded, this will have a positive impact on the wider industry, jobs and tax revenues."" The Football Association has welcomed the extra Â£100m of funding which chief executive Mark Bullingham says will ""help the pyramid get back on its feet."" David Kogan, the former Premier League rights executive, said the government's involvement in the deal was a ""really marked difference in the way football's been run in the past"". He told BBC Radio 4's The Today programme: ""This will buy the Premier League three years of some peace."" Sky Sports and BT both said the deal was good news for its viewers.

"Elon Musk said cryptocurrency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to climate change concerns, its CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet. Bitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped. Tesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met with an outcry from some environmentalists and investors. The electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (Â£1bn) of the world's biggest digital currency. Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch dogecoin moon mission Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubble But on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin, and intends to use it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more sustainable energy. Allow Twitter content?

Market analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage the concerns of investors who are focused on climate change and sustainability. ""Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now a major motivation for many investors. Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better in the environmental area of ESG,"" Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC. ""But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk to influence the cryptocurrency market, as he has done on so many other occasions,"" she added. Elon Musk is hardly ill-informed when it comes to both technology and the environment. When I interviewed him in 2016 he spoke passionately about Tesla's mission to make transport sustainable in the battle against the ""existential threat"" of climate change. So it is somewhat surprising that he has only just woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not exactly a green project. Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance runs a Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Right now, it shows that the process of mining the cryptocurrency - which involves using vast amounts of computer processing power - uses more electricity each year than Malaysia or Sweden and is closing in on the annual consumption of Egypt. Bitcoin enthusiasts insist that mining mainly involves renewable energy - in truth, the miners focus on whatever is cheapest and in China, where many of them are based, that is often electricity generated by coal. When he announced his grand cryptocurrency plans back in February - and made Tesla's chief financial officer ""Master of Coin"" - Elon Musk sparked a surge in the value of Bitcoin and the adoration of its fanatical devotees. Now with the price falling the chatrooms are full of the angry and disappointed  - many of them sporting the glowing eyes Bitcoin avatar - accusing their former hero of betrayal. A move which was hailed as signalling that Bitcoin was going mainstream has ended up showing just how volatile - and downright flaky - the whole cryptocurrency scene can be. Last month, Tesla announced profits for the first three months of the year were $438m, up from $16m last year, boosted by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits. Tesla profits boosted by Bitcoin and green credits Mr Musk has been one of the world's most high profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, often tweeting about Bitcoin and the once-obscure digital currency Dogecoin. His tweets in recent months helped to turn Dogecoin, which was started as a social media joke, into the world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is created by miners using high-powered computers to compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles. It is an energy-intensive process that often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. The dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin. China accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world,according to recent research. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found. That is because those Bitcoin miners tend to use electricity produced with fossil fuels, primarily coal, for most of the year, only shifting to renewable energy, mostly hydropower, during the rainy summer months. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Supporters of Bitcoin point out that the mainstream financial system, with its millions of workers and computers in air-conditioned offices, also uses large amounts of electricity, which is usually produced with fossil fuels.

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties.

Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Former prime minister David Cameron will be questioned by MPs later over his work lobbying for collapsed finance firm Greensill Capital. His unsuccessful attempts to obtain access to government-backed loans for the company during the pandemic have led to scrutiny of lobbying practices. The government has said Greensill's applications were dealt with properly and were ultimately rejected. In an earlier statement Mr Cameroninsisted he had not broken any rules. But he acknowledged he should have used ""only the most formal of channels"". Mr Cameron, who has not yet spoken publicly about his actions, will appear before both the Commons Treasury and Public Accounts committees. Texts show Cameron's intense lobbying for Greensill What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Greensill failure potentially criminal, says FCA On Tuesday, the Treasury Committee released dozens of texts and emails Mr Cameron sent to ministers and senior officials on behalf of Greensill, including sending nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 texts to Sir Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary of the Treasury. Greensill had hoped to take part in a government scheme - the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) - set up to help businesses during the pandemic. However, the Treasury rejected its application, concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. Reports of Mr Cameron's lobbying led Boris Johnson to order a review by lawyer Nigel Boardman into decisions made in government around the finance scheme and the role of Lex Greensill, founder of the company. Earlier this week Mr Greensill said hetook ""full responsibility"" for the firm's collapsewhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee. The Financial Conduct Authority has also launched an investigation into the failure of Greensill, which filed for insolvency in March, and said ""potentially criminal"" allegations had been made about its circumstances.

"The Indian variant is being carefully watched amid concerns over its spread in the UK The government is ""anxious"" about the variant and ""ruling nothing out"" in response, PM Boris Johnson says People aged 18 and over in parts of Lancashire will be offered vaccines due to concerns about variant levels A record high of 4.95 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment at the end of March 2021, according to NHS England More than 436,000 people had to wait more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in March 2021 - compared with 3,097 in March 2020 Spectators could be allowed at outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC understands The Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City has been moved from Istanbul to Porto because of Covid restrictions Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from the live page team - Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Vanessa Barford. Thanks for joining us, have a good evening and we will have more updates for you tomorrow. We are going to be winding down our coronavirus live page so here's a reminder of the stories of the day: An estimated 82.1% of people classified as clinically extremely vulnerable had received both doses of coronavirus vaccine by 9 May, according to NHS England figures. The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in an ""at-risk group"" or who are unpaid carers to have received a second jab by this date was 32.2%, the data suggests. People are identified as at risk or a carer in a number of ways, including through GP records, those receiving carer's allowance or on the GP Learning Disability Register, and those identified as unpaid carers by local authorities, NHS England said. Meanwhile, an estimated 90.2% of frontline NHS trust staff in England had been given both doses of coronavirus vaccine by May 9, NHS England figures suggest. The data only represents those NHS trust healthcare workers who appear in the NHS electronic staff record (ESR) covering all directly-employed staff in NHS trusts, with the exception of Chesterfield Royal NHS Foundation Trust. It does not include data on agency staff and NHS bank staff that are not paid through the ESR, NHS England added. People included in these figures may also have been counted as being part of the same, or another high-priority group, it added. The coronavirus outbreak in Moray - which has the highest case rates of any region in Scotland - is showing ""signs of improvement"", NHS Grampian has said. A surge of cases in the area has seen the infection rate rise to more than 98 cases per 100,000 - well above the 50-case threshold to move to level two of restrictions. Mainland Scotland is due to move to level two on Monday, allowing different households to meet indoors, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Moray is likely to remain in level three. Read more The culture secretary has said that he is more confident âwith
every passing dayâ that arts and sports venues in England will be able to fully reopen on
the 21 June. However, Oliver Dowden told the
Commons Culture Committee he could not yet give âfull assuranceâ
that the last stage in the roadmap for easing lockdown would be met. He also dismissed calls for a taxpayer-backed indemnity
scheme, but suggested that if events have to be cancelled due to a lack of
insurance, the government would look at intervening. Under the plans for easing restrictions in England, all legal limits on social contact are due to be lifted on 21 June. But some large events that had been planned for the summer, such as festivals, have already cancelled their events,saying they were unable to get coronavirus insurance and they could not continue to spend money without this safety net. People need to ""stop panicking"" every time a new coronavirus variant is identified in the UK, a leading scientist has said, amid concern about the growing number of cases of the Indian variant. Professor Robert Dingwall, who is a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said that while the Indian variant may be capable of becoming the dominant
variant in the UK, the risk of a surge in deaths or hospital admissions remains
low. Prof Dingwall, of the School of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, told the PA news agency: ""This variant seems to be better managed by the
vaccines than the South African variant so that vaccinated people have only a
very low risk of infection that is likely to be mild."" TheIndian variantof coronavirus is causing concern over its spread in the UK. But it is just one of the many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid-19 circulating around the world. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? Why do viruses mutate? And when does a variant become a variant of concern? Health correspondent Laura Foster and virologist Dr Cindy Duke explain. This video can not be played Covid India variant: What is a variant of concern? James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The variant that was first
detected in India, which may spread more quickly, is causing mounting concern. Numbers are relatively low, but
they are rising and the planned unlocking from Monday in England would
accelerate that spread. Meanwhile the hugely successful
vaccination campaign is not yet complete. So the worry is there is still
the possibility of a surge in cases and, because the vaccines are not perfect,
a rise in the numbers in hospital. This would be much smaller than it would
have been without vaccination. The other issue is the number of
confirmed cases tells us what happened one-to-two weeks ago - due to the delay
between someone catching the virus, it causing symptoms and then being
confirmed as B.1.617.2. One of the four tests for the
roadmap out of lockdown has always been the role of new variants. The key question is whether
local approaches in variant hotspots â such as expanded testing and vaccination
â would be enough, or if there needs to be a change to the overall plan. Nearly two thirds of people in Wales are estimated to have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19. Thelatest survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwhich took blood samples from nearly 1,000 people in Wales, estimated that 63.2% have antibodies present. The graphic below shows how this figure rises for older age groups up to an estimated 90% of those over 80. Presence of antibodies suggest people have either had the virus already or, in most cases, had a vaccine. You can find more detail on the surveyhere. Fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sports events in Northern Ireland from 24 May, the BBC has been told. The Northern Ireland Executive has been meeting to agree which lockdown restrictions can be lifted. It is understood ministers have agreed up to 500 fans can attend outdoor sport events from 24 May. However, up to 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend the Irish Cup final on 21 May. From 24 May, schools will also be allowed to play sports fixtures against each other and libraries and museums can reopen, while the stay local message will end. Indoor hospitality will be permitted to resume from 24 May - with mitigations - and indoor sports training will be allowed to restart for sports squads. Plans to ease restrictions on 24 May will be subject to final approval on 21 May. Read more. A total of54,797,640coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's35,906,671first doses and18,890,969second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabshere. There have been a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,651. There were also 2,657 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Surge testing
has already been introduced in some parts of the UK to help curb the spread of the
variant first found in India. Cases have
been detected in a number of areas of England including: There are also at least 12 cases of the Indian variant inNorthern Ireland, although officials have not confirmed exactly where they are. In Scotland, there are around 20-30 cases and the variant is suspected to be spreading inGlasgow, although this has yet to be confirmed. Cases have also been found inWales. Anxiety is growing about a coronavirus variant, first identified in India, that appears to be spreading in the UK. The concern is that certain new variants of the virus, like this one, may be able to spread more easily, make people sicker, or overpower vaccines. There are a few ""India"" variants, but one called B.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than the other two in the UK. There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease or might make current vaccines less effective, say UK officials. But the UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Here's what we know about coronavirus variants so far. If you were in two minds about getting your coronavirus jab, would the chance of winning a big cash prize sway you? The US state of Ohio is giving five people $1m (Â£710,000) each for getting their Covid-19 vaccines. It's part of a lottery launched to boost flagging take-up of jabs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the weekly draws will be paid for by coronavirus relief funds from the federal government. The US has given 58.7% of its adult population jabs against the disease. President Joe Biden says he wants to vaccinate 70% of adults by 4 July - American Independence Day. But, for weeks now, the number of vaccines administered has been in decline nationwide. Health officials have attributed this to hesitancy among some Americans. To convince the undecided, eye-catching giveaways - including beer, donuts, tickets to sporting events and cash prizes - are being offered in different parts of the country. Here's how the draw works. English Heritage staff at Durbar room at Osborne on the Isle of Wight are among those preparing for the reopening of England's visitor attractions on Monday If you're just joining us or need a recap of the day's coronavirus news - here's what we've been talking about so far. State governments in India are trying to buy coronavirus vaccines worth billions of dollars on the international market as locally-manufactured supplies run short. The most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, said it had been talking to firms including Pfizer. State authorities have had to curtail their ambitious vaccination plans amid the record surge in infections. It is not clear how soon manufacturers could supply India, with demand for vaccines remaining high. India has been vaccinating its population with the AstraZeneca jab, produced under licence in the country, and the domestically made Covaxin - but their current rate of production is well below demand. The country has only fully vaccinated 3% of its 1.3 billion people. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine was approved in the UK on Wednesday As we reported earlier, all adults will be offered Covid jabs in parts of Lancashire where there's been a spike in cases of the Indian coronavirus variant. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council has told us they're holding a meeting later and will release more details of the vaccination programme afterwards. A spokeswoman said: ""The council and NHS partners have secured extra doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be made available to anyone in Blackburn with Darwen aged over 18 from next week."" It comes as No 10 saysit has not ruled out surge vaccinationsas a way to deal with the rise of the Indian variant. Here's everything we know about the situation in Blackburn so far. The world could be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of March next year, according to the body that represents the biggest pharmaceutical companies. Thomas Cueni, who is director general of the Swiss-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) estimates global Covid vaccine manufacturing capacity will be 10 billion by the end of this year and that the world will have more vaccines than it needs by next year. Separately, he says waiving patent protection - as suggested by the US - would not lead to a short-term increase in global vaccine production because there are bottlenecks when it comes to securing the necessary raw materials such as glass vials. Too many new manufacturers coming on stream would simply lead to an even greater shortage of raw materials, he says. You can use ourCovid vaccine trackerto compare the roll-out of jabs around the world. Covid-19 case rates have increased slightly across most regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England. In the North West the rate was 32.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 9 May, up from 25.5 the previous week, while in the East Midlands it increased from 23.1 to 29.8. Slight increases were also recorded in the East of England, London and the North East. The South West had the lowest rate at 13.1, up from 12.2. Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest rate at 40.5 cases per 100,000 people, down slightly from 42.5 in the previous week. You can see how many cases there are in your areahere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"BT says it is speeding up its rollout of full-fibre broadband to five million more households than previously planned in a move it says could create up to 7,000 jobs. Boss Philip Jansen told the BBC that BT is also bringing forward its deadline to complete the work, with 25 million homes now due to be connected by 2026. ""It's a massive programme - a Â£15bn investment,"" he said. The telecoms giant has been criticised for the pace of full-fibre rollout. But BT said tax changes introduced on fibre broadband investment to homes and businesses allowed it to accelerate its strategy. Mr Jansen added that the faster rollout could be done through joint ventures with other parties to share the work and investment with its Openreach operation, especially to speed up broadband access to people in rural areas. A number of European telecoms rivals and private equity investors are thought to have looked at trying to secure a slice of the UK's fast-growing broadband infrastructure. Accelerating the plans ""will help fuel UK economic recovery, with better connectivity and up to 7,000 new jobs"", Mr Jansen said. BT confirms talks over future of sports business Many big companies use the Openreach network to provide their services, including TalkTalk and Sky, but have been critical of the pace of the rollout and prices. TalkTalk said it welcomed Thursday's announcement, but said that affordability and take-up of services was key. ""Whilst this [BT] commitment is great progress, it shouldn't hide the fact that the UK lags far behind other European nations in rolling out full fibre,"" a TalkTalk spokesperson said. BT news came as Britain's biggest broadband and mobile providerreported a 23% fall in full-year pre-tax profit,externalto Â£1.8bn, in large part due to a 7% fall in revenue to Â£21.3bn. BT is still looking at the future of its sports arm BT's profit was also eaten into by a bonus for frontline staff, increased cost of services and the continuing investment in the fibre network. But Mr Jansen said he was confident about future trading: ""After a number of years of tough work, and as we look to build back better from the pandemic, we're now pivoting to consistent and predictable growth."" And in a relief for shareholders, BT said it planned to bring back its dividend, which was suspended due to Covid, during the current financial year. Separately, thePremier League has agreed to roll over its existing television dealfor football rights with broadcasters, which include BT Sport. Last month, BT confirmed it was in talks with several companies about the future of its sports arm. On Thursday, Mr Jansen said he was ""open-minded"" on options for its BT Sport, but added: ""It's very possible we make no changes at all, because BT Sport now has a very clear profile and we're happy with it. ""It's possible that we do some sort of partnership or joint venture, and of course it is possible that we don't end up with BT Sport because there's a better owner of it who can invest more than we will invest. But I think it's too early to call that right now.""

John Teggart (centre) made a statement on behalf of the families on Thursday afternoon In a statement made after the families met to discuss the apology, Mr Teggart said: ""The feeling in the room was anger. That's the emotion coming through from all the family members - anger."" He added: ""It's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV. It's the timing. ""We hadn't asked for an apology. The words he put forward meant nothing."" Mr Teggart said Mr Johnson should have consulted with families about the contents of the letter. ""The manner in which he has done this is totally unacceptable. ""We want Boris Johnson in the dispatch box, speaking to Parliament and to the world about what's happened in Ballymurphy. And we don't want him in the second line to start talking about a statute of limitations, taking away from what we have achieved."" Mr Teggart said the next step was to make ""somebody responsible for [those] who killed our loved ones"". Janet Donnelly, whose father Joseph Murphy was killed in Ballymurphy, said Mr Johnson ""didn't have the nerve to go into the House of Commons and make an apology himself"". ""If he was in any way sincere with this, he should have done it right and he should have done it himself."" Carmel Quinn, the sister of victim John Laverty, expressed anger at the PM's use of the words ""the events"" to describe what happened. Carmel Quinn, whose brother John Laverty was killed, expressed her anger at the PM's wording ""It wasn't an event, it was an event. It was mass murder of a civilian population,"" she said. In his statement earlier on Thursday, Mr Lewis said the UK government ""profoundly regrets and is truly sorry"" for what happened in Ballymurphy. He said this also extended to the families for the ""additional pain"" they have had to endure and at how investigations were handled. This video can not be played 'Do this right - we want Boris Johnson at despatch box' Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the families felt like they were being treated like ""second class citizens"" after discovering from a journalist that Mr Lewis was making the statement. ""Why could Boris not do it? Why could he not have stood up and give that apology?"" she asked, in an interview with BBC NI's Talkback programme. ""Brandon Lewis is just like a puppet for Boris."" Ballymurphy: Who were the victims? 'Entirely innocent': What happened at Ballymurphy? Mr Lewis had told Parliament Mr Johnson was writing to the families. He said there was ""no doubt what happened on those awful few days in Ballymurphy fuelled further violence and escalation, particularly in the early years of the Troubles"". ""This government profoundly regrets and is truly sorry for these events, at how investigations after these terrible events were handled and for the additional pain that the families have had to endure in their fight to clear the names of their loved ones, since they began their campaign almost five decades ago,"" Mr Lewis said. On Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson had apologised to Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers in a phone call. However, on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during that call. Mary Lou McDonald said the PM did not apologise during a phone call with the first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday Speaking of his subsequent letter, she added: ""A second hand apology is no apology at all."" Ms McDonald called on Mr Johnson to meet the families, who had shown ""courage, dignity, resilience and stamina"". ""I think Boris Johnson could do well to borrow from these families some of that dignity and the British system needs to recognise what happened here."" But some victims' families said the remarks should have been made in public. On Thursday, Mr Lewis told Parliament he wanted ""to put on record the government's acknowledgement of the terrible hurt"" caused to the Ballymurphy families. Briege Voyle and John Teggart, whose relatives were killed in Ballymurphy, watch the NI secretary deliver his address Among the Ballymurphy victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded, a mother-of-eight and a former soldier who had lost his hand in World War Two. Nine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. However, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr. Mr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened. ""The families of those who were killed should never have had to experience the grief and trauma of that loss,"" Mr Lewis said. ""Above all, they should not have had to wait nearly five decades for the judgement this week, nor have been compelled to relive that terrible time in August 1971, again and again in their long and distressing quest for truth."" Brandon Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened He added that the desire for families of victims to know the truth about what happened to their loved ones was ""strong and legitimate"". ""Mr Speaker, this government wants to deliver a way forward in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, which will allow all individuals or families who want information, to seek and receive answers about what happened during the Troubles, with far less delay and distress,"" he said. ""We want a path forward which will also pave the way for wider societal reconciliation for all communities, allowing all the people of Northern Ireland to focus on building a shared, stable, peaceful, and prosperous future."" A number of MPs, responding to Mr Lewis, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have delivered the apology to Parliament. The Downing Street statement on Wednesday said the prime minister ""apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed"". Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh told Parliament the fact that families have had to wait for so long was a ""profound failure of justice"". ""In the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, David Cameron came to this House and apologised in a statement. He took full responsibility,"" she said. ""Where is the prime minister today and why has he not publicly apologised to the Ballymurphy families and to this House?"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Gregory Campbell asked the secretary of state to ensure that the Ballymurphy families, or those of IRA killings, do not ""suffer the ignominy of hearing about an amnesty"". The government is tobring forward legislation in the course of the next yearto deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Based on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations. Mr Lewis said it was important for the state to takes accountability for what happened in Northern Ireland, but added that it is important that ""we get to the heart of what happened"". Amnesty is a word which dare not cross the lips of government as it sets out its latest change of approach around the legacy of the Troubles. There has yet to be a clear, public enunciation of what is proposed. But it is this: a statute of limitations which would ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Not just future cases, but potentially, those already in train. It would apply across the board - to army veterans and former paramilitaries - on everything which happened before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The plan is the outworking of the government's pledge to protect soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Initial talks have taken place with political parties and meetings are planned with victims' groups. Sources have told BBC News NI that there were many questions, but very few detailed answers from the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. The plan has been met with loud opposition. Already, many are jumping ahead to whether the government, with the numbers at Westminster, will legislate regardless. The legacy plan would involve some form of investigations for families of the bereaved. But they would be investigations for the purposes of information recovery, not prosecutions. The government believes this is the key. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Ballymurphy deaths were ""sheer bloody murder"". ""Will the secretary of state ask the prime minister to come out of hiding, come with me, meet the Ballymurphy families and tell them to their faces why he wants to protect the killers?"" Mr Lewis said the government would consider the report in more detail. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he wanted to focus on the ""courage and dignity"" of the families affected. ""Does it [Mr Lewis' apology] also include how the British Army libelled many of the victims by calling them IRA gunmen and also how the Ministry of Defence, and some individual soldiers, frustrated the process of justice over many years?"" he asked. Denis Bradley, co-author of theConsultative Group on the Past Report,externalin 2009, said a statute of limitations was ""possibly workable"" as court action to deal with the Troubles had led to a ""hierarchy"" for victims. ""For everybody who gets into a court or into a coroner's inquest, there will be 50 victims who won't get in there,"" he told BBC News NI's The View programme. Mr Bradley, a former priest, worked with Lord Eames, a former Church of Ireland archbishop, to produce a document on ways to deal with legacy. On Thursday, he said the criminal justice system ""is not the place to do the past"". ""The past has become a swamp for everybody and there's very little solid ground on which to build a resolution and a solution,"" he added. Mr Bradley added that what many victims were searching for was ""information"" rather than court proceedings. PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971 Ballymurphy: Who were the victims?

"The government should still invest in projects such as HS2, despite the rise in home working, Sir John said. The government needs to keep up spending on public transport, even though its usage has plummeted during the Covid pandemic, a government adviser has told the BBC. Commuter numbers could drop by a quarter because of home working, said Sir John Armitt, head of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC). But the government should ""hold their nerve"" in case of a bounce back. This was important for sustainability reasons, he said. Sir John told the BBC that the NIC's modelling indicated there could be a continuing hit to passenger numbers of 25% from fewer commuters returning to offices after the pandemic. ""If you want to avoid congestion in the future, if you want to stick to your zero carbon, then you need to get people back on public transport. ""Therefore for the government, it's going to be a case of continuing to ensure that public transport is available, whether it's the trains or whether it's the buses, so that people can make use of it as and when they feel relaxed to do so,"" Sir John told the BBC. Road and rail building plans under review after Covid No full-time return to the office for over a million He said despite their modelling, the government should ""hold their nerve"" and wait to see actual data on the return to work, and give people the opportunity to make choices over the next two or three years.

During the pandemic, the government has underpinned practically the entire rail system. The latest figures showed there were fewer than a third of the normal level of rail journeys in the last quarter of last year. Sir John also said that city centres would change as a result of new ways of working, and that ""shops and offices could be replaced to a degree by housing"" and that ""could be really beneficial"". Last week, 43 out of 50big UK employers questioned by the BBCsaid they did not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time. They said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. In a report, the NIC acknowledged that the ""radical and rapid"" rise in working from home during the Covid pandemic could lead to a permanent shift to less commuting. The NIC found that almost a third of UK workers intended to work from home more often after the pandemic than they had before. Almost half of UK employees were doing some work from home in April 2020, while in March 2021, almost a third of employees were working from home exclusively and 12% occasionally, it said. Workers might also seek to relocate to more suburban and rural areas, but cities remained attractive and there might not be enough suburban and rural houses to cope with demand if people wished to relocate, it added. Home-working opportunities tended to be limited to certain types of occupations, such as those that needed higher levels of qualifications, the NIC said.

"Eluned Morgan and Jeremy Miles are rewarded with promotions within the cabinet Eluned Morgan has been named health minister with Jeremy Miles at education in a Welsh government reshuffle. In a surprise move, Vaughan Gething moves from health to economy, replacing Ken Skates who leaves the government. Mark Drakeford was sworn in as first minister earlier, after Senedd members backed him to continue in the role on Wednesday. Labour won 30 of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament in last week's election. Both Mr Gething and Mr Skates had been in their previous posts for five years. Mr Gething had a particularly high profile as health minister during the pandemic, in leading the response to the coronavirus crisis alongside Mr Drakeford and the chief medical officer. Vaughan Gething visited an NHS depot collecting supplies for India in one of his last acts as health minister on Monday Announcing the changes, the first minister paid tribute to Mr Skates, who he said would ""continue speaking up for north Wales and for Welsh Labour, but in a different role"". ""We will miss his energy and passion,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said Mr Gething's efforts during the pandemic had been ""extraordinary"" but he felt it was time ""to ask someone else to take on that challenge"". The former health minister, he said, was taking over the economy job ""at a crucial point in time - the pandemic is not just a public health emergency but also an economic one"". Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said there had been ""rumours for a while that Vaughan Gething wanted to move from the health portfolio"". ""He's been in position there for five years and was a deputy before that, and that's quite a long stint really, in a very difficult role and not least, of course, during a pandemic, so I can see the logic to that,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. Prof McAllister said his replacement, Eluned Morgan, as health minister had a ""very effective time during the pandemic in terms of fronting up on government policy, sometimes at very difficult times"", and she was being rewarded for that. Mark Drakeford (centre) assembles his new team at the Welsh government offices in Cardiff The new cabinet was expected to meet on Thursday evening to finalise Friday's Covid lockdown restrictions review. Julie James has been appointed to a new cabinet role as minister for climate change, with Lee Waters as her deputy. Mr Drakeford said: ""The environment will be at the heart of our decision-making. ""The climate change emergency has not gone away while we have been dealing with the pandemic. ""Wales is a beautiful country with immense natural assets, which will help power our recovery and create the jobs of the future. ""In my new government, the environment doesn't just have a seat at the cabinet table, it will be a consideration in all we do.""

Dawn Bowden, Member of the Senedd (MS) for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, joins the government from the backbenches as deputy minister for arts and sport and takes over Ms Hutt's former role of chief whip, responsible for ensuring discipline in the Labour ranks. Torfaen MS Lynne Neagle, a Cardiff Bay politician since 1999, also gets a government job for the first time, as deputy minister for mental health and wellbeing. In a statement marking his departure as economy minister, Mr Skates said: ""This week I informed the first minister of my wish to step away from Welsh government. After eight years in government, now is the right time."" He added: ""Clwyd South has always remained my number one priority, and my decision will enable me to spend more time in the constituency, focusing on local matters, as well as further strengthening the party's position in north Wales and further afield."" Conservative Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies said his members would ""scrutinise and hold ministers to account, but will also offer the hand of cooperation where possible to ensure Wales bounces back from the most difficult year we've experienced"". ""It's in this spirit that I want to wish the first minister and his new cabinet well as they start the significant task of ensuring our economy and public services get on the road to recovery,"" he said. Plaid Cymru South Wales West MS Sioned Williams welcomed the ""greater focus on climate change and mental health"" but urged new ministers in other portfolios to address the ""policy shortcomings and lack of delivery of their predecessors"". ""With record waiting lists, a low wage economy and one in three children living in poverty - all there before the pandemic and all on Labour's watch - we are in danger of getting the same results if ministers do the same thing over and over again,"" she said. The next Senedd term takes us through well over half of what the UK's advisers on climate change describe as a ""decisive decade"". By 2030 Wales needs to have got rid of two thirds of its greenhouse gas emissions. And if there's hope of no longer contributing to global warming by 2050, the complex rewiring required of our economy and way of life must truly get under way. It's a monumental task and these new climate change ministerial and deputy ministerial roles should be considered among the most senior and important jobs in the Welsh government. But of course every department and minister will have to work out how they too can rise to this challenge, with Wales already starting to feel the potentially disastrous effects of a changing climate.

"Elon Musk said cryptocurrency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to climate change concerns, its CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet. Bitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped. Tesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met with an outcry from some environmentalists and investors. The electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (Â£1bn) of the world's biggest digital currency. Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch dogecoin moon mission Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubble But on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin, and intends to use it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more sustainable energy. Allow Twitter content?

Market analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage the concerns of investors who are focused on climate change and sustainability. ""Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now a major motivation for many investors. Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better in the environmental area of ESG,"" Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC. ""But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk to influence the cryptocurrency market, as he has done on so many other occasions,"" she added. Elon Musk is hardly ill-informed when it comes to both technology and the environment. When I interviewed him in 2016 he spoke passionately about Tesla's mission to make transport sustainable in the battle against the ""existential threat"" of climate change. So it is somewhat surprising that he has only just woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not exactly a green project. Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance runs a Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Right now, it shows that the process of mining the cryptocurrency - which involves using vast amounts of computer processing power - uses more electricity each year than Malaysia or Sweden and is closing in on the annual consumption of Egypt. Bitcoin enthusiasts insist that mining mainly involves renewable energy - in truth, the miners focus on whatever is cheapest and in China, where many of them are based, that is often electricity generated by coal. When he announced his grand cryptocurrency plans back in February - and made Tesla's chief financial officer ""Master of Coin"" - Elon Musk sparked a surge in the value of Bitcoin and the adoration of its fanatical devotees. Now with the price falling the chatrooms are full of the angry and disappointed  - many of them sporting the glowing eyes Bitcoin avatar - accusing their former hero of betrayal. A move which was hailed as signalling that Bitcoin was going mainstream has ended up showing just how volatile - and downright flaky - the whole cryptocurrency scene can be. Last month, Tesla announced profits for the first three months of the year were $438m, up from $16m last year, boosted by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits. Tesla profits boosted by Bitcoin and green credits Mr Musk has been one of the world's most high profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, often tweeting about Bitcoin and the once-obscure digital currency Dogecoin. His tweets in recent months helped to turn Dogecoin, which was started as a social media joke, into the world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is created by miners using high-powered computers to compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles. It is an energy-intensive process that often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. The dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin. China accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world,according to recent research. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found. That is because those Bitcoin miners tend to use electricity produced with fossil fuels, primarily coal, for most of the year, only shifting to renewable energy, mostly hydropower, during the rainy summer months. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Supporters of Bitcoin point out that the mainstream financial system, with its millions of workers and computers in air-conditioned offices, also uses large amounts of electricity, which is usually produced with fossil fuels.

"This video can not be played How did a cyber-attack lead to US petrol queues? The operator of the biggest fuel pipeline in the US announced it would resume operations on Wednesday evening after a five-day closure. A ransomware cyber-attack forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the main part of its network on Friday. The 5,500-mile (8,900km) pipeline usually carries 2.5 million barrels a day on the East Coast. The closure saw supplies tighten across the US, with prices rising and a number of states declaring an emergency. Colonial Pipeline warned in a press release that it could take several days for the delivery supply chain to return to normal. Colonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline? ""Some markets served by Colonial Pipeline may experience, or continue to experience, intermittent service interruptions during the start-up period,"" they added in a statement. The FBI hasaccused a criminal gang called DarkSide,externalof being behind the ransomware attack. Colonial has said it will not pay the ransom demanded by the hackers. US petrol prices rose on Wednesday as motorists queued to fill up their cars on the sixth day of the Colonial Pipeline shutdown. The average price per gallon hit $3.008 (Â£2.14) - the highest level seen since October 2014, according to the Automobile Association of America. A spokeswoman said that the shutdown and ""fluctuating demand"" had led to higher prices. The pipeline operator said on Wednesday that it had restarted operations, but it warned that it would ""take several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal"". Governors in the states of Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia have all declared states of emergency, which mean they can introduce temporary rules to ease prices in their areas as a result. Fears over fuel shortages spurred some customers to panic buy petrol in the United States. For many people, the image of the oil industry is one of pipes, pumps and greasy black liquid. In truth, the type of modern operation Colonial Pipeline runs is extremely digital. Pressure sensors, thermostats, valves and pumps are used to monitor and control the flow of diesel, petrol and jet fuel across hundreds of miles of piping. All this operational technology is connected to a central system - and where there is connectivity, there is a risk of cyber-attack. Read more from BBC News cyber reporter Joe Tidy here According to data collated by tracking firm GasBuddy, at least 3,500 petrol stations had run dry across Virginia, North Carolina and and several other states on Wednesday. Virginia and Georgia were among the worst-affected, with more than 40% of petrol stations it monitors suffering from outages,it said on its website.,externalIn North Carolina, 65% of petrol stations had fuel outages. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said earlier in the week that the firm Colonial could make a decision on restarting operations on Wednesday. She did caution, however, that the full pipeline might not be active for days after that. Despite the government's appeal to consumers not to panic-buy, many motorists have been seen queuing to fill up their cars. Motorists were seen filling up multiple cans of petrol in North Carolina on Wednesday. #GasShortage2021 was also trending on social media, with some joking that they were reminded of the run on toilet paper seen at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. Others posted photos which appeared to show customers filling up plastic bags with petrol. US Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that the Biden administration was ""working around the clock"" to help deal with any shortages. ""This is a time to be sensible and to be safe, of course we understand the concern in areas where people are encountering temporary supply disruptions,"" he said. ""But hoarding does not make things better, and under no circumstances should gasoline ever be put into anything but a vehicle directly or an approved container, and that of course remains true no matter what else is going on."" The White House also said officials were considering new ways to alleviate any shortages, such as extending working hours for those transporting fuel.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson said the UK's Covid response would be ""placed under the microscope"" The government is ""fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage"" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. The inquiry would place ""the state's actions under the microscope"", he added, and take evidence under oath. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021. But addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not ""inadvertently distract"" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. The inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in ""due course"", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. On Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases. Mr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the ""right moment"". What is the Covid inquiry and how will it work? What's changing in England, Scotland and Wales? Town's Covid surge leaves hospitality nervous On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale He said the ""new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here"". ""Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January."" Boltonhas one of the highest instances of the Indian variantin the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s. Health officials in Glasgow have expressed concern abouta rising number of Covid cases in the city- the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. More than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths. The inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. Mr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a ""statutory basis"" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry. In response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman ""will happen before the spring of next year"". Mr Johnson -who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May- said: ""The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic."" He added: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year."" A WHO reportreleased on Wednesdaysaid the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. Most leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK. The inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. Key questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only ""war-gamed"" a serious flu epidemic. Why were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? Why was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? There will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. Different approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. The biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. The inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. The Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were ""getting away fromâ¦ early accountability"". Meanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference. She said spring 2022 was ""simply too late to begin"". ""It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year. ""A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter."" Along with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal ""lessons learned"" investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Downing Street confirmed an ""informal"" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published. The PM attended a Westminster Abbey service on Wednesday that paid tribute to nurses working during the pandemic Fran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a ""rapid review"". She told the BBC: ""That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would. ""That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions."" Dame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years."" Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry. He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise."" In the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic. He added he ""wholeheartedly"" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as ""a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital"". In response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly"" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would ""say that with more clarity a bit later on"". Everyone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice. On Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST. Pregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers. More than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab.

"Elon Musk said cryptocurrency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to climate change concerns, its CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet. Bitcoin fell by more than 10% after the tweet, while Tesla shares also dipped. Tesla's announcement in March that it would accept the cryptocurrency was met with an outcry from some environmentalists and investors. The electric carmaker had in February revealed it had bought $1.5bn (Â£1bn) of the world's biggest digital currency. Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch dogecoin moon mission Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubble But on Thursday, it backtracked on its previous comments. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He also said the electric carmaker would not sell any of its Bitcoin, and intends to use it for transactions as soon as mining shifts to using more sustainable energy. Allow Twitter content?

Market analysts see the move as an attempt by Tesla to assuage the concerns of investors who are focused on climate change and sustainability. ""Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues are now a major motivation for many investors. Tesla, being a clean energy-focused company, might want to work better in the environmental area of ESG,"" Julia Lee from Burman Invest told the BBC. ""But a cynic might suggest that this is just another move by Elon Musk to influence the cryptocurrency market, as he has done on so many other occasions,"" she added. Elon Musk is hardly ill-informed when it comes to both technology and the environment. When I interviewed him in 2016 he spoke passionately about Tesla's mission to make transport sustainable in the battle against the ""existential threat"" of climate change. So it is somewhat surprising that he has only just woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not exactly a green project. Cambridge University's Centre for Alternative Finance runs a Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Right now, it shows that the process of mining the cryptocurrency - which involves using vast amounts of computer processing power - uses more electricity each year than Malaysia or Sweden and is closing in on the annual consumption of Egypt. Bitcoin enthusiasts insist that mining mainly involves renewable energy - in truth, the miners focus on whatever is cheapest and in China, where many of them are based, that is often electricity generated by coal. When he announced his grand cryptocurrency plans back in February - and made Tesla's chief financial officer ""Master of Coin"" - Elon Musk sparked a surge in the value of Bitcoin and the adoration of its fanatical devotees. Now with the price falling the chatrooms are full of the angry and disappointed  - many of them sporting the glowing eyes Bitcoin avatar - accusing their former hero of betrayal. A move which was hailed as signalling that Bitcoin was going mainstream has ended up showing just how volatile - and downright flaky - the whole cryptocurrency scene can be. Last month, Tesla announced profits for the first three months of the year were $438m, up from $16m last year, boosted by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits. Tesla profits boosted by Bitcoin and green credits Mr Musk has been one of the world's most high profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, often tweeting about Bitcoin and the once-obscure digital currency Dogecoin. His tweets in recent months helped to turn Dogecoin, which was started as a social media joke, into the world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is created by miners using high-powered computers to compete against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles. It is an energy-intensive process that often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. The dominance of Chinese Bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to switch from cheap fossil fuels to more expensive renewable energy sources could mean there are few quick solutions to the emissions concerns over Bitcoin. China accounts for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world,according to recent research. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's 10 largest cities, the study found. That is because those Bitcoin miners tend to use electricity produced with fossil fuels, primarily coal, for most of the year, only shifting to renewable energy, mostly hydropower, during the rainy summer months. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Supporters of Bitcoin point out that the mainstream financial system, with its millions of workers and computers in air-conditioned offices, also uses large amounts of electricity, which is usually produced with fossil fuels.
