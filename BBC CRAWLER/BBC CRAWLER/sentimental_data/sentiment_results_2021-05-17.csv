"Ella also wears a hat around the house as a ""comfort blanket"", her family said A teenager with a rare illness that has caused her hair to fall out can now wear a cap to school after pupils protested when her request was denied. Ella Goodwin's father said the 13-year-old was told a cap or hoodie was not part of the uniform policy at Heritage High School in Clowne, Derbyshire. The row led to a protest outside the school involving dozens of Ella's fellow pupils on Monday morning. The school confirmed it has been agreed Ella can wear a cap and hoodie. However Ella said she was frustrated that the school did not agree to her request earlier. ""Rules should be bent for someone going through something like this. ""But it was an amazing feeling just to know how many people supported me. ""I'm not ashamed... but wearing a cap and hoodie just gives me confidence and comfort. I would not have gone back to school without it,"" she said. In recent months, Ella has experienced severe hair loss Ella was diagnosed two years ago with CRMO (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis), a disease where the immune system attacks the bones and causes pain and swelling. Recently, her hair has started falling out. Her father Shaun Goodwin said doctors are unsure if the hair loss is a symptom or a side effect of medication she has to take. Ella has had her head shaved and was given a wig by the Little Princess Trust, but Mr Goodwin said she did not feel comfortable in it. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He said he and partner Joanna Davies had a meeting with the school last week in which they were told a cap - including one with school branding - was not part of the uniform policy. The row sparked a backlash among parents and pupils, and 25 to 30 children protested the decision on Monday morning, many of whom wore caps and hoodies in solidarity. ""We went up to the school to support Ella and the amount of children and parents stood there with hats on - it's amazing. ""The support of the community is outstanding."" Joanna Davies, Ella's father's partner, also shaved her hair to help the schoolgirl feel comfortable at home Ms Davies added: ""She [Ella] doesn't want to have to wear the cap but her hair loss is beyond her control. ""Even though everyone knows she's lost her hair, she uses the hat and hoodie to control who sees it and says when she is shielding it she feels in control. ""Even in the house she wears the hat, it's like her comfort blanket."" A spokesperson for the Two Counties Trust - which the school is part of - said: ""We are happy to confirm that we have now been able to speak to Ella's family and have agreed with them that Ella can wear a cap and a hoodie to ensure she feels as comfortable and supported as possible when at school. ""We will continue to do everything we can to ensure Ella and her family are appropriately supported through this challenging period. No student has been sanctioned around this matter."" Mr Goodwin said: ""It's amazing, but it shouldn't have got to this in the first place. ""They ought to have come to this decision quicker, but I'm well chuffed. ""Seeing the protest and the amount of support she had brought a lump to my throat."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez appeared together in the video for her song, Stuck With U Pop star Ariana Grande has married her fiance Dalton Gomez in a ""tiny and intimate"" wedding. The 27-year-old American singer tied the knot in front of fewer than 20 people over the weekend, the PA news agency reported.

"Bolton's vaccine hubs saw long queues across the weekend More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. The town has seen a sharp spike in infections since mid-April and the B.1.617.2 variant now makes up the majority of new cases. Prior to the push, about 10,000 people in the highest priority groups were yet to be vaccinated. Dr Helen Wall, who is leading the town's vaccine rollout, said it had been ""emotional"" to see. She said many who had been eligible for some time came for a jab over the last two days and she now hoped the programme had ""made a big dent"" in the list of outstanding eligible residents. Bolton recorded 733 new cases of Covid-19 in the seven days to 11 May - the highest anywhere in the UK, the latest data shows. However, the rate of new cases among people in the town aged 60 and over is just 59.9, up from 35.3 a week earlier. By contrast, the rate for those aged 10-19 in Bolton currently stands at 486.2 per 100,000, up sharply from 200.7 one week earlier, while for those aged 20-29 the rate has jumped from 147.9 to 310. The efforts to get everyone eligible vaccinated saw long queues form at vaccination hubs. BBC presenter and comedian Paddy McGuinness shared a video of the queues in his ""strong"" hometown on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite the concerns over the Indian variant,the easing of lockdown rules has gone ahead as plannedin England. The easing allows people to socialise indoors in limited numbers, hug loved ones and visit pubs and restaurants inside. Alex McVey, who runs Odessa cafe in Bolton, said trade had been OK since reopening at 7:00 BST but, due to Covid measures, he had reduced the number of seats from 72 to 22. ""It has been a lot different this morning. It has taken ages and ages to get set up and everything in place,"" he said. Mr McVey, who has been forced to make four members of staff redundant during the pandemic, said he was ""a little bit nervous"" about the reopening but remained hopeful. In Bolton, a big push to get more people vaccinated is bearing fruit. Health officials are targeting about 10,000 people who are eligible but have yet to come forward, but know that take-up of the vaccine in some parts of the town is lower than the national average. And they reject the charge that they are flouting the national rules on who can get a jab. In February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which sets the guidelines for the UK's vaccination roll-out - announced factors other than just health and age could be taken into account. So deprivation, ethnicity and living in a multi-generational household with older, vulnerable relatives could mean that younger people are eligible. This is not bending the rules, local leaders say. Rather, it is exactly what the rules are for. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday thata local lockdown in Bolton had not been ruled outdue to a rise in cases. He added that the ""vast majority"" of locals who had been hospitalised in recent days had not taken up the offer of a vaccine. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Early data suggests jabs work against India variant How much faster does the Indian variant spread? Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Dr Wall said the vaccination hubs were ""seeing people coming forward that clearly had the option to have the jab for some time - older people, disabled people - and they've chosen to come forward now"". ""I think in part that's because we brought this into the community as a trusted place, but also the things that are going on in Bolton are quite worrying for people,"" she said. ""I think that's given some push to people coming forward now for the vaccine."" Residents in Bolton lined up outside the mobile vaccination centre Surge testing has already begun in other areas of north-west England where cases involving the Indian variant are on the rise. The ""variant of concern"" has also been detected in Blackburn, Lancashire, which neighbours Bolton, and in Sefton on Merseyside. Blackburn with Darwen's public health directorsaid everyone over-18 should book a Covid vaccination in the area. But the prime minister's official spokesman said local areas should not vaccinate young people earlier than planned to stem the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus. He told a Westminster briefing  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had said the best way to protect against the new variant was to ensure vulnerable groups got their second dose of the vaccine.

"Wilder (right) could be in line to delay any bout between Joshua (left) and Fury Tyson Fury has been ordered to fight Deontay Wilder for a third time, casting doubt over a proposed August super bout with Anthony Joshua. Fury, 32, won the WBC world heavyweight title from Wilder in a rematch in February 2020 after an initial draw. The pair were due to fight again but delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic prompted Fury to seek an alternative. On Monday a US judge ruled in mediation that Wilder has a right to face Fury for a third time before 15 September. The American's team had long argued their fighter had a contractual right to a third fight with Fury. But after delays caused by the pandemic led to a July 2020 contest being postponed, Wilder's team sought to move the bout to 2021. Fury refused the 2021 date and said he would move on. That prompted mediation overseen by American judge Daniel Weinstein, who has now sided with Wilder and set a 15 September deadline for a third contest. ""Until we can reach an accommodation with Deontay Wilder's people, I can't say that [Fury's fight with Joshua] will definitely happen,"" Fury's promoter Frank Warren told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""But we are working hard to get that over the line. We were talking last night and hopefully we can do that. If not then Tyson, if he wishes, will go to the fight with Wilder. They're the only two options."" Fury's US promoters Top Rank did not wish to comment on the development when contacted by BBC Sport. But Top Rank founder Bob Arumtold ESPN,externalthat Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas has been reserved for a Fury-Wilder fight on 24 July. ""We're not paying Wilder to step aside,"" said Arum. ""It's better to get rid of him and go about our business. We can make the Fury-Joshua fight for November or December."" Just 24 hours before Monday's arbitration hearing, Fury confirmed he had agreed to fight fellow Briton Joshua - holder of the IBF, WBA and WBO belts - for all four heavyweight world titles in Saudi Arabia on 14 August. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has also said several times that the August bout was in place, with terms agreed. The mediation outcome does not necessarily mean a Fury-Joshua fight cannot take place in August but fresh deals will now need to be struck for it to do so. That could mean Wilder being offered money to allow Fury-Joshua to take place. ""It'll cost quite a bit of money. He will want as much as possible so I think it'll be about the negotiation if we go down that road,"" said Warren. Saudi authorities are reportedly putting forward around Â£106m just to stage the Fury-Joshua contest. Pay-per-view sales and ticket sales will serve to substantially add to the total revenue of the contest. If it goes ahead, Joshua versus Fury will be the first bout in heavyweight history where all four world titles are on the line. BBC Sport's Luke Reddy Just 24 hours after Fury said he had been in conversation with Saudi organisers and agreed to seal the deal, this Wilder news will come as a blow. How big of a blow is not yet clear. With so much money to be made from Joshua v Fury, one would think a deal will be struck with Wilder whereby he steps aside and perhaps even gets told he can face the winner in 2022. It may suit him to do so given he can pocket a sizeable sum and prepare against an opponent of his choosing short-term - he has been out of the ring for 15 months. There were already countless moving parts to a Joshua-Fury deal, with three promoters, several broadcasters, four sanctioning bodies and a host venue all needing to co-operate to get the fight done. But any postponement would be highly damaging for the sport given so many fans from outside boxing's hardcore support will tune in to watch it. It is a golden opportunity to draw new people into the sport, and fights with such a crossover appeal are rare.

"Jennifer Johnson denied perverting the course of justice in 1987 The ex-girlfriend of convicted Babes in the Wood murderer Russell Bishop faces jail after being found guilty of lying over evidence in his 1987 trial. Jennifer Johnson admitted she lied over a sweatshirt found near the scene. The 55-year-old said she had no choice after being threatened by her partner, but she was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice. Bishop was cleared in 1987 and not convicted of killing Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows, both nine, until 2018. Johnson is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday. Mr Justice Fraser said a custodial sentence was inevitable. The jury reached a majority decision after 12 hours of deliberation. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows (right) were killed in Wild Park, Brighton, in 1986 The jury was told Johnson had lied ""prolifically"" and ""significantly undermined"" the trial in 1987. Johnson claimed she had acted under duress and ""had no choice"" but to lie during the trial more than 30 years ago. Jurors heard Ms Johnson first told police a sweatshirt found near the scene belonged to Bishop, but later denied it in a witness statement and at his first trial. Mr Justice Fraser said Johnson was ""infatuated"" with Bishop but the relationship had been ""problematic"". Russell Bishop faced a second trial in 2018 and was convicted Karen and Nicola's parents - Michelle and Lee Hadaway and Susan and Barrie Fellows - did not give up their fight for justice and in 1988 called on Sussex Police to reinvestigate the case. Mr Fellows told the BBC at the time: ""There's a man out there (who) murdered two little girls."" Some of the girls' family members wept as verdicts on Johnson were delivered. Babes in Wood killer's ex delays justice with lie Justice after 32 years for 'babes in the wood' killer 'Cowardly' killer's three decades of lies After his acquittal, Bishop went on to attack a seven-year-old girl on the South Downs in 1990. She was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and left for dead. Bishop was sentenced to life in prison. He was finally convicted of the murders of Karen and Nicola in 2018 following a DNA breakthrough that linked the sweatshirt to the girls and his home. Michelle Hadaway, Karen's mother, has sat through four court cases over the murder of her daughter Following Johnson's conviction, Libby Clark, senior crown prosecutor at the CPS, said: ""Jennifer Johnson's deception caused decades of distress to the families of Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway. ""Her actions were clearly those of someone who wanted their partner acquitted of murder, rather than a person living in fear."" After the hearing, Sussex Police Ch Supt Nick May said Johnson's lies ""mattered"". He said her lies had undermined a key part of the prosecution in 1987. During the trial, the prosecution claimed Johnson stood to benefit from Bishop selling his story as an innocent man to the News of the World for Â£15,000. After the verdicts, Nicola's family criticised the now-closed Sunday newspaper and said it ""provided encouragement for for Johnson to lie"". Lorna Clary, Nicola's cousin, said: ""As a key witness in Bishop's 1987 trial, she [Johnson] lied knowing that there would be a huge financial reward if Bishop received two acquittals for the double child murders. ""He did indeed receive the wrongful acquittals. The News of the World got their stories. The perpetrators got their payday. ""Our two families were devastated again after those verdicts, yet on the same evening, Johnson and the Bishops celebrated with a funded champagne dinner at the Hilton Hotel. They should all hang their heads in shame."" She urged other historical murder families to ""take hope"", adding: ""The truth does eventually catch up with those who hide in plain sight.""

"Bobby Storey's funeral caused a row at Stormont over potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations A report into how police handled the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey has found no bias. A review was launched after it was announcedprosecutions could not be brought against 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians. It was conducted by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). It found there were ""grounds for criticising the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) approach"" but they were not ""especially serious failings"". ""They do not approach the level at which censure of individual officers, or resignations, would be justified."" PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne welcomed the report and said the police would learn lessons but that he hoped ""we can move on now"". DUP assembly member (MLA) Mervyn Storey, whose party had called for Mr Byrne to resign, said there should be a further investigation into his actions and those of senior officers. Why was Bobby Storey's funeral so controversial? Policing in NI 'never more politicised or toxic' How Bobby Storey funeral investigation unfolded About 2,000 people attendedMr Storey's funeral in Belfastlast June at a time when rules placed strict limits on funeral numbers and public gatherings. The political fall-out saw the DUP and Ulster Unionists call for the resignation of Mr Byrne. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill was among those questioned as part of a six-month police investigation following the funeral. Mary Lou McDonald, Gerry Adams and Michelle O'Neill were among the senior Sinn FÃ©in members at the funeral Justice Minister Naomi Long, who backed Mr Byrne, asked for the external review on behalf of the policing board. The report, published on Monday, levelled no major criticisms at the PSNI. It found there was ""nothing to suggest that there was any bias towards one community or another in the way the PSNI dealt with this funeral"". ""We have seen nothing to suggest a funeral of a leading figure in the loyalist community wouldn't have been approached in the same way."" It added: ""The regulations at the time of the funeral were both confusing and controversial. ""That alone posed an arguably insurmountable problem for the PSNI."" In March, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it could not recommend prosecutions due to a lack of clarity around the regulations and because of prior engagement between Sinn FÃ©in and the PSNI during funeral planning. This video can not be played We have to police sensitively - PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne The HMIC report backed the PPS over this decision. ""We find the PPS arguments wholly persuasive,"" it said. ""We have taken our own, independent legal advice, and have reached the same conclusion: we are not confident that any of the funeral attendees could be shown to have committed an offence under the regulations."" In regards to conversations between the police and Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly ahead of the funeral, the report said: ""We saw nothing to suggest that the manner in which he engaged with the PSNI was anything other than open and professional."" However, it also said that ""Mr (Gerry) Kelly chose not to share his account of his conversations with the PSNI commanders in the run-up to the funeral with us."" Mr Kelly told BBC NI's Evening Extra that his dealings with the HMIC were ""open and professional"". ""The issue here, I think, is that the report has come in, the DUP in particular simply do not want to accept it, even though it's the third report. ""At some stage they need to accept that this has been reported on, reported on and reported on."" Speaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback, the head of HMIC, Matt Parr, said: ""The police priorities were that it wasn't a major violent incident, serious disorder, that there weren't really overt displays of paramilitary force as we've seen in some other funerals. ""And I think against that they put enforcement of the regulations as the third priority. ""That's what's caused all the outcry and I understand that, but I think what we're saying is that in the particular context of Northern Ireland it's kind of understandable why they had that set of priorities."" Reacting to the report, Mr Byrne said he welcomed the findings and that the police would learn lessons. He added: ""I'd like to think we can move on now."" The chief constable repeated that he would not step down in the wake of unionist criticisms. ""If every time there's criticism, the chief, whoever it is, steps aside, we won't create continuity and we'll make that position, the office of chief constable, vulnerable, so I'm not resigning,"" he said. Speaking at a press conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Byrne explained that police would have been criticised if they had taken a different approach on the day of the funeral. ""Knowing what we know now, we would have been heavily criticised, even more heavily criticised, had we used force, for example, to try to block the Falls Road or indeed clear people from it. ""We have to police sensitively, proportionately, and within the law, and that's what we tried to do."" The justice minister, Mrs Long, said police have to deal with each set of circumstances based on the challenges that they anticipate. ""So it's not about policing everything the same way, it's about policing everything the way it needs to be policed in order to get as fair an outcome as possible,"" she said. ""I think that is what, by and large the PSNI has been found to do in this report."" DUP assembly member Mervyn Storey said the report was a ""missed opportunity for full accountability"" and that there should be a further investigation into the actions of the chief constable and senior officers. He added: ""It is now imperative that the Policing Board establishes a process to examine the impact of police failings on support for the police and rule of law, not just in the context of the Storey funeral but in relation to allegations of two-tier policing in the policing of parades and protests."" Ulster Unionist policing spokesman Mike Nesbitt called on the PSNI to ""review the nature of its relationship with Sinn FÃ©in"" and said there had been ""no winners from this entire process"". The SDLP's Dolores Kelly said the report ""confirms the invidious and impossible position that police officers were placed in during the Bobby Storey funeral"". Alliance Party Policing Board member John Blair said the report showed that ""reaction from some political quarters in relation to this funeral was disproportionate in the extreme"". Inspectors assessed whether the PSNI's approach ""was within the parameters of policing standards"" for the report. The report was published after Mr Parr, briefed Mrs Long and a closed-doors session of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged everybody in Bedford to ""exercise caution"" Surge testing has started in Bedford due to an increase in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the town was the ""next biggest cause of concern"" after Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. Bedford has the second-highest rate of Covid-19 in England, with cases doubling every five days. ""I would urge everybody in Bedford to exercise caution and engage in testing,"" Mr Hancock said. Surge testing has started at two schools in Bedford. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons early evidence suggested the Indian variant was more transmissible than the Kent variant. At present there is no evidence that the Indian variant is resistant to current vaccines.

Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said local ""surge vaccinations"" were not being pursued as there was a ""finite"" supply of doses and younger people were less at risk from the virus. Louise Jackson, portfolio holder for public health and wellbeing at the council, said she thought not offering vaccines to people aged over 16 was ""a mistake"".

"Wilder (right) could be in line to delay any bout between Joshua (left) and Fury Tyson Fury has been ordered to fight Deontay Wilder for a third time, casting doubt over a proposed August super bout with Anthony Joshua. Fury, 32, won the WBC world heavyweight title from Wilder in a rematch in February 2020 after an initial draw. The pair were due to fight again but delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic prompted Fury to seek an alternative. On Monday a US judge ruled in mediation that Wilder has a right to face Fury for a third time before 15 September. The American's team had long argued their fighter had a contractual right to a third fight with Fury. But after delays caused by the pandemic led to a July 2020 contest being postponed, Wilder's team sought to move the bout to 2021. Fury refused the 2021 date and said he would move on. That prompted mediation overseen by American judge Daniel Weinstein, who has now sided with Wilder and set a 15 September deadline for a third contest. ""Until we can reach an accommodation with Deontay Wilder's people, I can't say that [Fury's fight with Joshua] will definitely happen,"" Fury's promoter Frank Warren told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""But we are working hard to get that over the line. We were talking last night and hopefully we can do that. If not then Tyson, if he wishes, will go to the fight with Wilder. They're the only two options."" Fury's US promoters Top Rank did not wish to comment on the development when contacted by BBC Sport. But Top Rank founder Bob Arumtold ESPN,externalthat Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas has been reserved for a Fury-Wilder fight on 24 July. ""We're not paying Wilder to step aside,"" said Arum. ""It's better to get rid of him and go about our business. We can make the Fury-Joshua fight for November or December."" Just 24 hours before Monday's arbitration hearing, Fury confirmed he had agreed to fight fellow Briton Joshua - holder of the IBF, WBA and WBO belts - for all four heavyweight world titles in Saudi Arabia on 14 August. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has also said several times that the August bout was in place, with terms agreed. The mediation outcome does not necessarily mean a Fury-Joshua fight cannot take place in August but fresh deals will now need to be struck for it to do so. That could mean Wilder being offered money to allow Fury-Joshua to take place. ""It'll cost quite a bit of money. He will want as much as possible so I think it'll be about the negotiation if we go down that road,"" said Warren. Saudi authorities are reportedly putting forward around Â£106m just to stage the Fury-Joshua contest. Pay-per-view sales and ticket sales will serve to substantially add to the total revenue of the contest. If it goes ahead, Joshua versus Fury will be the first bout in heavyweight history where all four world titles are on the line. BBC Sport's Luke Reddy Just 24 hours after Fury said he had been in conversation with Saudi organisers and agreed to seal the deal, this Wilder news will come as a blow. How big of a blow is not yet clear. With so much money to be made from Joshua v Fury, one would think a deal will be struck with Wilder whereby he steps aside and perhaps even gets told he can face the winner in 2022. It may suit him to do so given he can pocket a sizeable sum and prepare against an opponent of his choosing short-term - he has been out of the ring for 15 months. There were already countless moving parts to a Joshua-Fury deal, with three promoters, several broadcasters, four sanctioning bodies and a host venue all needing to co-operate to get the fight done. But any postponement would be highly damaging for the sport given so many fans from outside boxing's hardcore support will tune in to watch it. It is a golden opportunity to draw new people into the sport, and fights with such a crossover appeal are rare.

"Euphoria at the return of indoor hospitality and hugging has not reached every part of Scotland. While most of the country went into level two and most islands skipped to level one, Glasgow and Moray remain under tighter restrictions. Hospitality businesses have expressed anger at the 11th hour change of heart. And concern mounts in East Renfrewshire which now exceeds Moray's Covid case rate but has been allowed to ease restrictions. Last Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that all mainland areas with the possible exception of Moray were expected to move to level two rules this week. But on Friday she announced that the move to level two would be delayed by a week for both Moray and Glasgow after cases rose rapidly, particularly in the south of the city. What Covid rules are changing, and when? What level will you be in from 17 May? Glasgow and Moray to stay under level 3 Covid rules It means bars and restaurants in Glasgow and Moray will not be able to serve alcohol indoors and they will have to close their doors to indoor diners at 20:00. Donald Macleod, convenor of the Glasgow Licensing Forum, believes hospitality is being ""treated with contempt"". He said: ""I am happy for those who can open but I feel desperately sad and sorry for all those in Glasgow on what should have been a happy Monday, has become a very blue, dank, dreary Monday. ""It's a terrible situation to be in with a Â£1m-a-day bar bill being foisted upon the city because of wasted stock, staff coming off furlough, preparation - it's a total disgrace. ""Cases go up but mortality rates don't, hospital admissions don't and yet we are locked down. There is no run on the NHS. We should not be shutting down an economy, a whole city. ""Many are going to go out of business."" Beer gardens will remain open in Glasgow, where people are still not allowed to drink inside pubs Mario Gizzi, owner of the DRG group, which owns bar and restaurants in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland, said Friday's decision to keep the city on level 3 has already cost his business thousands of pounds. He said: ""We were given no time to prepare for this. ""Last week, at just one site in Glasgow - the Citizen - we spent Â£6,000 in staff costs getting ready for reopening and another Â£6,000 in fresh produce which we can't use now. ""I've also had to pay for extra staff in our call centre to cancel all this week's bookings. ""It's an absolute disgrace."" The Citizen in Glasgow has lost around Â£12,000 in staff and stock costs through the cancelled restart of indoor hopitality Meanwhile The Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) and UK Hospitality have written to the first minister asking her to address the challenges faced by tourism and hospitality businesses in Glasgow and beyond as a result of the city remaining in level three restrictions, with the added travel ban. The groups say a significant part of the industry and its supply chain have been plunged into crisis. They are calling for more financial support and highlighted urgent issues such as the costs involved in preparing to reopen, waste of stock and the mental health of employers and employees. Sarah Holmes says seeing all the ""freedom stories"" from other parts of Scotland has been frustrating In Moray, Sarah Holmes, who has run Elgin's Pencil Me In for five years, has expressed her frustration at remaining in level three. ""It is frustrating when you see all the happy freedom stories today"", she said. ""I don't disagree (with that decision), but the travel restrictions massively impacts tourism in Moray. ""I feel we need to ride out this week. Online is only about 30% of our turnover, most is in store - the reason I have a shop is I like the customer connection"". She said she was ""quietly confident"" that Moray's infection rate would have fallen enough by the end of the week to justify an imminent move to level two. Johanna and Sean enjoy pints outdoors in the evening sunshine Cousins Johanna and Sean enjoyed drinks outdoors in the southside of Glasgow - despite much of the mainland being able to order alcohol indoors. The two agree that planning catch ups with friends and family has been more difficult due to ongoing restrictions in the city - and are often beholden to the elements. Johanna said: ""When it's sunny Queen's Park is really busy and you feel like there's an atmosphere in the community then - but that's been few and far between recently."" ""The weather has been absolutely heinous so I was looking forward to not being freezing,"" added Sean. ""But I feel like people have been friendlier - what I've noticed is everyone working in hospitality has been really professional in making us feel very safe but I actually think people in general are a bit kinder to each other."" Disappointments aside, Sean said that living with restrictions has become the ""new normal"" and that she believes the decision to keep Glasgow in level three was the right one. Johanna added: ""The response was really quick. I'm getting my vaccine earlier because of that and it shows there is some responsibility there. It makes you feel safer knowing they've made that decision."" Both Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, have described the Covid situation as ""fragile"". Mr Swinney toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthat every local authority was being monitored and restrictions would be applied to contain outbreaks, if necessary. But he added: ""The last thing we want to do is to have local authority areas going in and out of restrictions like a yo-yo, that's the worst of all possible models for the business community and the wider community."" Meanwhile Prof Leitch warned on Sunday thatGlasgow might have to remain under level three restrictions for longerif the rise  - which is being driven by the so-called Indian variant - shows no sign of abating. Why is the Indian variant causing concern in the UK? The latest seven-day average per 100,000 population in the city is 94.5 cases, well above the level two benchmark of 50 cases. Eyes are also on East Renfrewshire, which has seen its case rate overtake Moray. It emerged on Monday that people in Glasgow between the ages of 18 and 39 were now being invited to get their vaccinations sooner than previously planned. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it would be targeting the city areas of Battlefield, Gorbals and Hutchesontown, Govanhill, Aikenhead, Kingston West and Dumbreck, Maxwell Park, Mosspark, Pollokshields and Strathbungo. The health board also said plans were being finalised to bring forward second vaccinations for over 50s. Tourism businesses on the Isle of Gigha are disappointed at their level situation Residents of Gigha, which is among those Scottish islands which has not moved down to level one, are also disappointed. The island's heritage trust welcomed the further relaxation of Covid rules, but said islanders had worked for more than a year to suppress the virus and had hoped to move down to level one. A trust said the island had been lucky to have no Covid cases and, while there was some nervousness around the return of visitors last summer, there were businesses on Gigha highly reliant on tourism. A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""Islands that are easily reachable from the mainland, including Bute, Skye and Cumbrae as well as Gigha, will remain in level two to prevent transmission of the virus. ""We have always said we will keep plans under review and accelerate the lifting of restrictions as soon as it is safe to do so."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Violence between Israelis and Palestinians shows little sign of easing despite calls for calm Israel conducts dozens more air strikes on Gaza as the militants continue to fire rockets into southern Israel A top Islamic Jihad commander is thought to be among the Palestinian militants killed on Monday The US urges both sides to protect civilians and says it is focusing on ""quiet, intensive diplomacy"" But the US again blocks a UN Security Council resolution calling for a halt to the fighting The violence has entered its second week and killed more than 200 people in Gaza and 10 in Israel We are now pausing our live coverage - thanks for joining us today.

Medics say Gaza's hospitals are being stretched further as a result of the conflict Gaza's hospitals are being stretched to collapse as a result of airstrikes, a doctor has told the BBC. Health officials in the Gaza Strip are making urgent appeals for supplies, amid reports of power blackouts and sewage running on to streets. The health system had already been struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic before the conflict erupted last week, and how they are ""suffering"" further, Dr Mohammad Abu Rayya, a paediatrician, toldthe BBC's Newshour programme. ""The situation in Gaza is becoming worse and worse - the health system is being collapsed and stretched,"" he said. ""Day by day we receiving emergency cases, causalty cases, we are receiving dead bodies. We don't have a morgue big enough for the killed and dead bodies."" Earlier today, the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for health workers to be protected. Left: The current Google Earth image of Hanadi tower in Gaza; right: a high-resolution satellite image showing the tower destroyed Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world, but why does it appear blurry on Google Maps? The issue has been highlighted by researchers who use open-source, publicly available information - including mapping data - to locate attacks and document the destruction. ""The fact that we don't get high-resolution satellite images from Israel and Palestinian territories sets us back,"" said Samir, one of the investigators. Read BBC Reality Check's full explanation of why this is. US President Joe Biden says he is speaking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu within the hour, amid a flurry of diplomatic calls to try to end the crisis. Asked if he would join other international calls for a ceasefire in Israel, president Biden said: ""I will be speaking with the prime minister in an hour and I'll be able to talk to you after that."" US officials have held over 60 calls with Middle East counterparts aimed at de-escalating the violence, according to the White House press spokesperson. They include National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaking to counterparts in Israel and Egypt and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan and Tunisia. Other countries are also trying to find a diplomatic solution. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says he's spoken to foreign minister in Jordan and Turkey to find an ""urgent end to the violence"".

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his US counterpart Joe Biden has ""bloody hands"" because of his support for Israel. He criticised the US president over US media reports that the Biden administration has approved a new $735m (Â£510m) arms sale to Israel. ""You are writing history with your bloody hands,"" president Erdogan said in a nationally televised address. The Turkish president has been a vocal champion for the Palestinian cause during his 18 years in power. Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza as part of Operation Protective Edge The current flare-up of violence is the worst between Israel and Palestinians since 2014. So what exactly happened back then? After weeks of growing tension - which included the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers - Israel launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July, which it said was aimed at stopping rocket attacks from Gaza and destroying Hamas's capabilities. Over the next seven weeks, Israel carried out thousands of air strikes and launched a ground operation to destroy tunnel networks in Gaza. Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Eventually a truce was declared, brokered by Egypt. UN investigators said that 2,251 Palestinians died, of whom 1,462 were civilians, while on the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. A UN human rights investigationsaid there was evidence of ""serious violations"" by both sides. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki says a lot of work is going on behind the scenes Speaking at the daily White House briefing, President Biden's spokesperson Jen Psaki has defended the US government's approach to the conflict. The White House is coming under pressure from some in the Democratic Party to call for a ceasefire. Earlier today, a group of Democratic senators called for a ceasefire to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" And as we reported earlier, the US blocked a UN motion that called for an end to fighting. Asked why the US hasn't called for a ceasefire yet, Jen Psaki said that a lot of diplomatic activity was going on behind the scenes ""The role we are playing, the prism we are making all of our decisions through, is how can we help bring an end to the violence and bringing an end to, de-escalate the situation on the ground,"" she said. ""Our approach is through quiet, intensive diplomacy, and that's where we feel we can be the most effective."" Israel says its air strikes are not aimed at Gaza's civilian population A teacher from Gaza has told BBC OS that life in the Palestinian territory is ""extremely frightening"". ""Everything for us is really scary,"" said Hanan, 26. ""Whenever we hear a car... or a motorbike, we feel scared that maybe they will strike this car or strike this person who is inside the car. So it's very frightening for us, we can't sleep. ""It's really hard when we hear an air strike. The first thing we do is gather together as a family and find the safest place, but there's no safe place when there's an air strike. We gather together and my mother says all the time, 'if we're going to die let us die together'."" Hanan added: ""We are losing more people, people who we love. We are suffering every day in Gaza. We are in a very big jail together, so living here is so hard."" The United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss how to ""calm the situation"". The pair discussed âways to reduce tensions and strengthen global efforts to stop the acts of violence in Israel and Palestine,â state media reports. The UAE is among Arab nations who have found themselves in a tricky situation as the conflict has worsened. The country recently signed an agreement to normalise their relations with Israel. But as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues, the improvement in relations has been put on hold. Members of the UN Security Council met virtually on Sunday The US has blocked a joint UN Security Council statement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the third time in a week, according to diplomats. The text, which was drawn up by China, Tunisia and Norway, called for the ""cessation of violence and respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, especially children"". It was due to be approved by the council's 15 members on Monday but the US said it ""could not currently support an expression"", a diplomat told AFP news agency. The security council met online on Sunday after the US - a staunch ally of Israel -  delayed a session planned for Friday. The Israeli military says its fighter jets have bombed the  headquarters of Hamas's internal security operations in the northern Gaza Strip. In a statement quoted by Israeli media, the Israel Defense Forces said the building was ""a central terror infrastructure of Hamas, from which the organisation's military intelligence operates"". There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air strike. This video can not be played Father-of-three Eitan Singer tells the BBC how he tries to reassure his children as they face nightly rocket attacks from Hamas and have to rush to a shelter.

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is in Paris for a summit hosted by Emmanuel Macron France and Egypt are the latest nations to call for an end to the violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron and his Egyptian
counterpart, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, said they âshare a deep worry about the
ongoing escalation of violence and deplore the many civilian victimsâ, the ÃlysÃ©e
Palace said in a statement. They also agreed to co-ordinate efforts towards brokering
âa rapid ceasefireâ, with officials from Egypt, Qatar, the US and the UN working
to end the crisis. The Egyptian president is in Paris to attend a summit on
Sudan. This video can not be played Watch: How the tower block collapsed after strike A reporter with the Al-Jazeera news outlet has been describing what it was like to flee the tower block in Gaza where her organisation's offices were based,moments before it collapsed after being hit in an Israeli air strike on Saturday. Youmna Al-Sayed said they had been given a one-hour warning by Israel on to evacuate the 12-storey building, prompting a scramble to make it out. ""We know that when we get an evacuation call, we need to act
quickly because they might target the building at any time,"" she told theBBC's Newshour programme. ""Everyone was running around, on the
stairs in the elevators, grabbing their kit, grabbing our cameras, whatever we
could get with us, and running quickly, which was really traumatising for us."" ""Iâve seen lots of buildings being targeted and brought down -
but when itâs your house or your buildingâ¦ itâs really devastating.â Gazaâs Hamas-run health ministry says 200 people have now
been killed there in Israeli strikes since the hostilities between Palestinian militants
and Israel began a week ago. A statement adds that 59 children and 35 women are among
the dead, and that 1,305 other people have been injured. Israelâs military says it has killed more
than 130 militants in Gaza. Ten people, including two children and one soldier, have also been killed in Israel as a result of rockets fired by militants in Gaza in the
same period. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin Most of the protests in Germany were peaceful German politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned anti-Semitic slogans and chants at recent pro-Palestinian protests and outside synagogues. Last night a Jewish cemetery in Berlin was desecrated with green paint. Over the weekend there were about a dozen pro-Palestinian protests across Germany and there were reports of anti-Semitic chants and placards. In at least two cases Jewish people were attacked. Most protests remained peaceful, but there were clashes when police tried to stop one protest because Covid restrictions were not being respected. Over the past week Israeli flags have been burnt outside at least three synagogues. Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, president of the Bundestag, described the images of anti-Semitics slogans at the protests as ""unbearable"". Israel's military said on Monday that it had destroyed 15km (nine miles) of tunnels used by Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip. Tunnel systems used by jihadist fighters have long been an important target for Israeli air raids. Their construction began nearly two decades ago, along the border with Egypt, in order to smuggle weapons and other goods.

Since then, tunnels have also been dug beneath the Gaza-Israel border allowing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters to emerge behind Israeli border guards. The underground systems protect the militants' command structures while their fighters conduct operations against Israeli forces. Many of the tunnels - usually about 65ft (20m) deep - are interconnected with multiple camouflaged openings to emerge above ground in different locations. To keep the system hidden, the entrances are mostly located on the bottom floor of houses, mosques, schools or other public buildings. Read more:Inside Gaza's tunnels Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sarah Everard's body was found in woodland in March Dozens of officers and staff are being investigated for looking up details of the Sarah Everard case on the police computer system, the Met has said. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished as she walked home in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland.

"Jennifer Johnson denied perverting the course of justice in 1987 The ex-girlfriend of convicted Babes in the Wood murderer Russell Bishop faces jail after being found guilty of lying over evidence in his 1987 trial. Jennifer Johnson admitted she lied over a sweatshirt found near the scene. The 55-year-old said she had no choice after being threatened by her partner, but she was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice. Bishop was cleared in 1987 and not convicted of killing Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows, both nine, until 2018. Johnson is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday. Mr Justice Fraser said a custodial sentence was inevitable. The jury reached a majority decision after 12 hours of deliberation. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows (right) were killed in Wild Park, Brighton, in 1986 The jury was told Johnson had lied ""prolifically"" and ""significantly undermined"" the trial in 1987. Johnson claimed she had acted under duress and ""had no choice"" but to lie during the trial more than 30 years ago. Jurors heard Ms Johnson first told police a sweatshirt found near the scene belonged to Bishop, but later denied it in a witness statement and at his first trial. Mr Justice Fraser said Johnson was ""infatuated"" with Bishop but the relationship had been ""problematic"". Russell Bishop faced a second trial in 2018 and was convicted Karen and Nicola's parents - Michelle and Lee Hadaway and Susan and Barrie Fellows - did not give up their fight for justice and in 1988 called on Sussex Police to reinvestigate the case. Mr Fellows told the BBC at the time: ""There's a man out there (who) murdered two little girls."" Some of the girls' family members wept as verdicts on Johnson were delivered. Babes in Wood killer's ex delays justice with lie Justice after 32 years for 'babes in the wood' killer 'Cowardly' killer's three decades of lies After his acquittal, Bishop went on to attack a seven-year-old girl on the South Downs in 1990. She was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and left for dead. Bishop was sentenced to life in prison. He was finally convicted of the murders of Karen and Nicola in 2018 following a DNA breakthrough that linked the sweatshirt to the girls and his home. Michelle Hadaway, Karen's mother, has sat through four court cases over the murder of her daughter Following Johnson's conviction, Libby Clark, senior crown prosecutor at the CPS, said: ""Jennifer Johnson's deception caused decades of distress to the families of Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway. ""Her actions were clearly those of someone who wanted their partner acquitted of murder, rather than a person living in fear."" After the hearing, Sussex Police Ch Supt Nick May said Johnson's lies ""mattered"". He said her lies had undermined a key part of the prosecution in 1987. During the trial, the prosecution claimed Johnson stood to benefit from Bishop selling his story as an innocent man to the News of the World for Â£15,000. After the verdicts, Nicola's family criticised the now-closed Sunday newspaper and said it ""provided encouragement for for Johnson to lie"". Lorna Clary, Nicola's cousin, said: ""As a key witness in Bishop's 1987 trial, she [Johnson] lied knowing that there would be a huge financial reward if Bishop received two acquittals for the double child murders. ""He did indeed receive the wrongful acquittals. The News of the World got their stories. The perpetrators got their payday. ""Our two families were devastated again after those verdicts, yet on the same evening, Johnson and the Bishops celebrated with a funded champagne dinner at the Hilton Hotel. They should all hang their heads in shame."" She urged other historical murder families to ""take hope"", adding: ""The truth does eventually catch up with those who hide in plain sight.""

"Ella also wears a hat around the house as a ""comfort blanket"", her family said A teenager with a rare illness that has caused her hair to fall out can now wear a cap to school after pupils protested when her request was denied. Ella Goodwin's father said the 13-year-old was told a cap or hoodie was not part of the uniform policy at Heritage High School in Clowne, Derbyshire. The row led to a protest outside the school involving dozens of Ella's fellow pupils on Monday morning. The school confirmed it has been agreed Ella can wear a cap and hoodie. However Ella said she was frustrated that the school did not agree to her request earlier. ""Rules should be bent for someone going through something like this. ""But it was an amazing feeling just to know how many people supported me. ""I'm not ashamed... but wearing a cap and hoodie just gives me confidence and comfort. I would not have gone back to school without it,"" she said. In recent months, Ella has experienced severe hair loss Ella was diagnosed two years ago with CRMO (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis), a disease where the immune system attacks the bones and causes pain and swelling. Recently, her hair has started falling out. Her father Shaun Goodwin said doctors are unsure if the hair loss is a symptom or a side effect of medication she has to take. Ella has had her head shaved and was given a wig by the Little Princess Trust, but Mr Goodwin said she did not feel comfortable in it. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He said he and partner Joanna Davies had a meeting with the school last week in which they were told a cap - including one with school branding - was not part of the uniform policy. The row sparked a backlash among parents and pupils, and 25 to 30 children protested the decision on Monday morning, many of whom wore caps and hoodies in solidarity. ""We went up to the school to support Ella and the amount of children and parents stood there with hats on - it's amazing. ""The support of the community is outstanding."" Joanna Davies, Ella's father's partner, also shaved her hair to help the schoolgirl feel comfortable at home Ms Davies added: ""She [Ella] doesn't want to have to wear the cap but her hair loss is beyond her control. ""Even though everyone knows she's lost her hair, she uses the hat and hoodie to control who sees it and says when she is shielding it she feels in control. ""Even in the house she wears the hat, it's like her comfort blanket."" A spokesperson for the Two Counties Trust - which the school is part of - said: ""We are happy to confirm that we have now been able to speak to Ella's family and have agreed with them that Ella can wear a cap and a hoodie to ensure she feels as comfortable and supported as possible when at school. ""We will continue to do everything we can to ensure Ella and her family are appropriately supported through this challenging period. No student has been sanctioned around this matter."" Mr Goodwin said: ""It's amazing, but it shouldn't have got to this in the first place. ""They ought to have come to this decision quicker, but I'm well chuffed. ""Seeing the protest and the amount of support she had brought a lump to my throat."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Supermarkets in NI struggled for some food stocks when the protocol was implemented in January The UK is proposing to phase in new Irish Sea border checks on food products in four stages from October. The details are contained in a Northern Ireland Protocol roadmap shared with the EU, which has been seen by the BBC. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In March, the UK delayed introducing some new border processes without EU agreement. That led to the EU starting legal proceedings against the UK. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' At the end of March, the UK sent the roadmap to the EU, which sets out how the two sides should work together to implement the protocol. It has formed a starting point for ongoing technical talks between officials. On Sunday, the UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, urged the EU to rapidly""find a new approach and new solutions"".,external The UK roadmap document covers more than 20 separate issues including medicines, access to databases, pet travel and the VAT treatment of second-hand cars. At last. Now we can see in black and white the problems with the protocol that have been identified by both sides, rather than relying on leaks and second-hand accounts. That's useful. And there are a lot of issues to be resolved, reminding us that agreeing a deal is one thing and implementing it in the real world is another. This roadmap also shows the potential trouble ahead. If the UK's scheme for sending supermarket goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is going to be phased in during 2021 and 2022 (and 2023?) then the UK will probably have to ask the EU for another extension to the grace period before European laws will be fully respected, which won't go down well in Brussels. Then the EU also needs to agree that British-regulated medicines can be sold in Northern Ireland. And when exactly will the Northern Ireland Executive start building the bricks and mortar customs facilities that the UK has promised the EU but which are so offensive tothe DUP's newly-elected leader? The dates are still a secret. And a moment of truth seems to be brewing, with the Brexit Minister Lord Frost suggesting that in June or July the UK will decide whether the protocol can be made to work in the long term. The movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been the biggest practical challenge of the sea border. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. That means food products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain need to be professionally certified and are subject to new checks and controls at ports. Unionist parties have said they oppose the protocol for placing a trade border in the Irish Sea The two sides agreed an initial three-month grace period which meant supermarkets did not need to comply with all the EU's usual certification requirements. The UK unilaterally extended that grace period until October; the roadmap suggests what should happen next. The document states: ""The UK will roll out official certification in four phases."" It suggested that phase one in October will cover fresh meat products and phase two at the end of January 2022 will cover dairy products, plants and wine. Phases three and four would cover fruit and vegetable marketing standards, pet food, organics and composite products. No dates are given for phases three and four with the document saying a full timeline ""requires additional clarity on infrastructure and staffing"" as well progress on integrating the UK and EU certification systems. It is not yet clear if the EU would consider these timelines to be reasonable. Meat and dairy products will be among the issues tackled by phases one and two of the proposal Some details are included on the UK's Digital Assistance Scheme (DAS) which is intended to digitise the agri-food certification and verification process. It said first users should be registered next month with final testing in August, roll out in October and integration with the EU system in January. Some parts of the roadmap are vague. For example, no target dates are suggested for the construction of permanent border control posts at Northern Ireland's ports despite these facilities having planning permission and funding. However, the document added the government will set out ""a detailed delivery plan"" for permanent facilities. In other areas, there is a greater commitment to giving dates. The UK, for instance, said it proposes to issue guidance by the end of this month on the long-term arrangements for business-to-consumer parcel deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. On Monday, outgoing Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said we needed to see action in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol from the UK government. Mrs Foster told MLAs that Lord Frost recognised that there were no unionists in favour of the current arrangements. ""Instead of listening to words we actually [need to] see action in relation to the protocol,"" Mrs Foster said. Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the Northern Ireland Protocol was the best outcome for dealing with the damage caused by Brexit. During an online meeting with the Institute of International and European Affairs, Mr Martin said people needed to focus on the full implementation of what had been agreed. The taoiseach said Brexit had caused damage which could not be undone but added that the authorities must now do what they could to limit its damage. Mr Martin said there was a process to resolve difficulties, and said Ireland and the EU were in solution mode. He also said he was concerned about the mood in unionism in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol. But he argued the Northern Ireland Protocol did not interfere with the principle of consent and was not an issue of identity or sovereignty. He suggested the arrangement could be very advantageous to sectors in Northern Ireland, including foreign direct investment. The taoiseach also told the audience he had been reading about how the protocol was helping Northern Ireland farmers to sell milk south of the Irish border. He said he had a sense many more moderate people were happy with the protocol but were keeping their heads down. Mr Martin added his government would not ""stop being an open door"" to unionists.

"This video can not be played A holidaymaker said she was ""so excited"" to be heading on a coach trip to the Lake District Indoor eating and drinking was back on the menu from Monday as Wales eased Covid rules to alert level two. Cinemas and visitor attractions such as museums and galleries were also allowed to reopen in the latest round of lockdown easing. Wales' latest reopening was similar to that of last summer, but this timewith a vaccination programme in place. Foreign travel is permitted to a small number of countries, although the Welsh government has advised against it. However physical contact, such as hugs, is still restricted to members of extended households or ""support bubbles"",unlike in England. After three lockdowns and thevaccination programme roll-out, Wales has seen asignificant fall in Covid casesin recent months. But newly reappointed First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government would maintain its cautious approach to lockdown easing,as concerns rise about a variant of coronavirus from India. Indoor leisure, such as this bingo hall in Rhyl, have reopened Ministers had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further from Monday, but Mr Drakeford said officials had ""decided to hold back"" for more advice on the variant. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Rules for reopening cinemas 'impractical' No Covid deaths across 16 counties in Wales From Monday, Wales is adopting the ""traffic-light"" system, allowing the resumption of international travel. But the first minister warned last week international travel was ""best avoided"" because of concerns travellers could carry Covid with them. Teresa Moriarty's coffee shop has welcomed back customers indoors Teresa Moriarty, owner of Coffee Plus in Cardiff, was delighted to reopen indoors and hopes to keep the new customers who used her takeaway service during lockdown. ""There has been a lot of support for small businesses, we've adapted and done pretty well,"" she said. Inside was a mix of people getting away from working at home to families spending time together again. Kirsty Jones, from Cardiff, who was with her grandmother for brunch, said: ""It's lovely to start getting back to normal. We haven't seen each other as much as we would have liked, so it's lovely not to have to worry about the weather."" Friends and families can now meet and not worrying about the weather Anna Redfern, who owns Cinema and Co in Swansea,called the Welsh government's rules,externalfor the hospitality and tourism trade ""bewildering"". ""The government is telling us what direction to walk in, what doors to use and they're just impractical,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales. ""Trying to navigate through this rule book which is supposed to be guidance is really stressful."" Catherine Hummel, co-owner of Riverside Camping near Caernarfon, said it was ""very exciting"" to be able to welcome back campers with tents as she could now reopen shower and toilet facilities as part of the easing of rules. ""It's great news because a lot of them we didn't see last year at all,"" she said. Hotel boss Joe Lavin said his phones had been ""melting"" due to demand Conwy's Castle Hotel general manager Joe Lavin said phones had been ""melting"" due to demand ahead of welcoming customers back from Monday. ""We're looking at a full week from this weekend and beyond,"" he said. Mr Lavin said the ""biggest change"" to the business was adopting track and trace technology and an online booking system. Pub owner Sian Shepphard says bookings have been ""brilliant"" Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey pub in Pontypool, said advance bookings for inside dining had been ""brilliant"", although the business had remained busy in its beer garden prior to the rules easing further. ""We've got lots of measures in place just to make sure that everyone's safe but primarily has a good time and actually is able to come out and eat inside a restaurant,"" she said. Holidaymakers began setting off with travel firm Edwards Coaches in Llantrisant, for UK getaways. Owner Jason Edwards said Covid had been ""devastating"" but added Monday felt like Christmas morning with staff turning up to work two hours early. ""That just gives you an idea of the appetite for getting things done,"" he said. Customer Gill Jones said she was ""over the moon"" to be able to travel by coach to the Lake District. ""A year last February was the last holiday I went on... so this is a big escape,"" she said. Andy Ainscough hopes north Wales can cash-in on staycations this summer The Adventure Parc Snowdonia complex in the Conwy valley is to reopen on Tuesday, having been closed since March 2020. Alongside its surfing facilities, a new hotel will open its doors for the first time following a Â£20m upgrade of the site in the hope of capitalising on 'staycations'. ""Unfortunately we lost a lot of staff [but] we're rebuilding now to reopen both the adventure park and the Hilton Garden Inn, hopefully with a bang,"" said managing director Andy Ainscough. ""Bookings are very strong, there's a lot of interest, not only in north Wales but in ourselves and the local attractions, so it's very positive. ""Especially with staycations this year, and [it being] harder to get abroad, hopefully north Wales will be the choice for people's holidays."" Wales has now seen two million people vaccinated Mr Drakeford said last week the restrictions were being relaxed ""thanks to everyone's hard work and ongoing efforts"". ""By sticking with the rules and our successful vaccine programme, we are making really good progress in controlling the virus and keeping rates low. ""But the pandemic isn't over.

"Long working hours are killing hundreds of thousands of people a year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The first global study of its kind showed 745,000 people died in 2016 from stroke and heart disease due to long hours. The report found that people living in South East Asia and the Western Pacific region were the most affected. The WHO also said the trend may worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic. 'I was working 72 hours a week - it was cult-like' Go 'extra mile' despite 95-hour week - Goldman boss Goldman Sachs bankers ask for 80-hour week cap The research found that working 55 hours or more a week was associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from heart disease, compared with a working week of 35 to 40 hours. The study, conducted with the International Labour Organization,external(ILO), also showed almost three quarters of those that died as a result of working long hours were middle-aged or older men. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the long hours were worked. Five weeks ago,a post on LinkedIn,externalfrom 45-year-old Jonathan Frostick gained widespread publicity as he described how he'd  had a wake-up call over long working hours. The regulatory programme manager working for HSBC had just sat down on a Sunday afternoon to prepare for the working week ahead when he felt a tightness in his chest, a throbbing in his throat, jawline and arm, and difficulty breathing. ""I got to the bedroom so I could lie down, and got the attention of my wife who phoned 999,"" he said. While recovering from his heart-attack, Mr Frostick decided to restructure his approach to work. ""I'm not spending all day on Zoom anymore,"" he said. His post struck a chord with hundreds of readers, who shared their experiences of overwork and the impact on their health. Mr Frostick doesn't blame his employer for the long hours he was putting in, but one respondent said: ""Companies continue to push people to their limits without concern for your personal well-being."" HSBC said everyone at the bank wished Mr Frostick a full and speedy recovery. ""We also recognise the importance of personal health and wellbeing and a good work-life balance.  Over the last year we have redoubled our efforts on health and wellbeing. ""The response to this topic shows how much this is on people's minds and we are encouraging everyone to make their health and wellbeing a top priority."" While the WHO study did not cover the period of the pandemic, WHO officials said the recent jump in remote working and the economic slowdown may have increased the risks associated with long working hours. ""We have some evidence that shows that when countries go into national lockdown, the number of hours worked increase by about 10%,"" WHO technical officer Frank Pega said. The report said working long hours was estimated to be responsible for about a third of all work-related disease, making it the largest occupational disease burden. The researchers said that there were two ways longer working hours led to poor health outcomes: firstly through direct physiological responses to stress, and secondly because longer hours meant workers were more likely to adopt health-harming behaviours such as tobacco and alcohol use, less sleep and exercise, and an unhealthy diet. Andrew Falls, 32, a service engineer based in Leeds, says the long hours at his previous employer took a toll on his mental and physical health. ""Fifty to 55 hour weeks were the norm. I was also away from home for weeks on end."" Andrew Falls says being sent to jobs away from home with little notice added to the pressure of his work ""Stress, depression, anxiety, it was a cauldron of bad feedback loops,"" he says. ""I was in a constant state of being run down."" After five years he left the job to retrain as a software engineer. The number of people working long hours was increasing before the pandemic struck, according to the WHO, and was around 9% of the total global population. In the UK, theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) found,externalthat people working from home during the pandemic were putting in an average of six hours of unpaid overtime a week. People who did not work from home put in an average of 3.6 hours a week overtime, the ONS said. This video can not be played White boys' club? New tales from the City The WHO suggests that employers should now take this into account when assessing the occupational health risks of their workers. Capping hours would be beneficial for employers as that had been shown to increase productivity, Mr Pega said. ""It's really a smart choice to not increase long working hours in an economic crisis.""

"The Queen joined Prince Charles for the first Jubilee tree planting in the grounds of Windsor Castle in March People across the UK are being urged to plant trees in an initiative to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The Queen joined the Prince of Wales as he planted the first Jubilee tree at Windsor Castle earlier this year to launch the scheme honouring the monarch's 70-year reign. TheQueen's Green Canopy (QGC),externalwill see new trees planted, as well as ancient woodlands and forests protected. Prince Charles encouraged people to ""plant a tree for the jubilee"". ""In other words, a 'tree-bilee'"", he said in a video message. Taking part in the scheme, hosted by climate charity Cool Earth, could range from individuals planting trees in their own gardens to the creation of platinum jubilee copses on council land or avenues in cities or housing developments.. Schools and community groups will be able to apply for a share of three million free saplings from the Woodland Trust as part of the project. Charles' tree was planted earlier this year during official planting season (October-March) The prince said: ""Whether you are an individual hoping to plant a single sapling in your garden, a school or community group planting a tree, a council, charity or business intending to plant a whole avenue of trees or a farmer looking to create new hedgerows, everyone across the country can get involved."" He said it is vital more of theright species of trees are planted, in the right placesand that more woodlands, avenues, hedgerows and urban planting schemes should be established, while protecting and sustaining what we already have. Describing it as a ""statement of hope and faith in the future"", the prince said planting trees and hedgerows and protecting existing woodlands and forests were simple, cost-effective ways to protect the planet. The initiative will also highlight 70 irreplaceable ancient woodlands across the UK and identify 70 ancient trees. A pilot training programme for unemployed young people aged between 16 and 24 to plant and manage trees will also be created and run through Capel Manor College, London's only specialist environmental college, of which the Queen Mother was patron. Donations to the scheme will go to deprived areas and urban schools via one of the partner organisations of the Queen's Green Canopy, Trees for Cities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thrown his support behind the initiative. He said: ""Our trees stand at the frontline of our fight against climate change and by sustaining our beautiful countryside for generations to come. ""The Queen's Green Canopy is a fitting tribute to her majesty's years of service to this country. I urge everyone to get involved."" The Queen has herself planted more than 1,500 trees around the world during her reign. Woodland Trust chief executive, Darren Moorcroft, said the last year had ""emphasised the central role that trees and woods play in the life of the nation"". He added: ""We need more projects like this, giving people access to our natural heritage, opportunities to do something positive for the environment, and helping to safeguard it for our children in the face of a combined climate and nature crisis.""

"Bobby Storey's funeral caused a row at Stormont over potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations A report into how police handled the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey has found no bias. A review was launched after it was announcedprosecutions could not be brought against 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians. It was conducted by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). It found there were ""grounds for criticising the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) approach"" but they were not ""especially serious failings"". ""They do not approach the level at which censure of individual officers, or resignations, would be justified."" PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne welcomed the report and said the police would learn lessons but that he hoped ""we can move on now"". DUP assembly member (MLA) Mervyn Storey, whose party had called for Mr Byrne to resign, said there should be a further investigation into his actions and those of senior officers. Why was Bobby Storey's funeral so controversial? Policing in NI 'never more politicised or toxic' How Bobby Storey funeral investigation unfolded About 2,000 people attendedMr Storey's funeral in Belfastlast June at a time when rules placed strict limits on funeral numbers and public gatherings. The political fall-out saw the DUP and Ulster Unionists call for the resignation of Mr Byrne. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill was among those questioned as part of a six-month police investigation following the funeral. Mary Lou McDonald, Gerry Adams and Michelle O'Neill were among the senior Sinn FÃ©in members at the funeral Justice Minister Naomi Long, who backed Mr Byrne, asked for the external review on behalf of the policing board. The report, published on Monday, levelled no major criticisms at the PSNI. It found there was ""nothing to suggest that there was any bias towards one community or another in the way the PSNI dealt with this funeral"". ""We have seen nothing to suggest a funeral of a leading figure in the loyalist community wouldn't have been approached in the same way."" It added: ""The regulations at the time of the funeral were both confusing and controversial. ""That alone posed an arguably insurmountable problem for the PSNI."" In March, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it could not recommend prosecutions due to a lack of clarity around the regulations and because of prior engagement between Sinn FÃ©in and the PSNI during funeral planning. This video can not be played We have to police sensitively - PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne The HMIC report backed the PPS over this decision. ""We find the PPS arguments wholly persuasive,"" it said. ""We have taken our own, independent legal advice, and have reached the same conclusion: we are not confident that any of the funeral attendees could be shown to have committed an offence under the regulations."" In regards to conversations between the police and Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly ahead of the funeral, the report said: ""We saw nothing to suggest that the manner in which he engaged with the PSNI was anything other than open and professional."" However, it also said that ""Mr (Gerry) Kelly chose not to share his account of his conversations with the PSNI commanders in the run-up to the funeral with us."" Mr Kelly told BBC NI's Evening Extra that his dealings with the HMIC were ""open and professional"". ""The issue here, I think, is that the report has come in, the DUP in particular simply do not want to accept it, even though it's the third report. ""At some stage they need to accept that this has been reported on, reported on and reported on."" Speaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback, the head of HMIC, Matt Parr, said: ""The police priorities were that it wasn't a major violent incident, serious disorder, that there weren't really overt displays of paramilitary force as we've seen in some other funerals. ""And I think against that they put enforcement of the regulations as the third priority. ""That's what's caused all the outcry and I understand that, but I think what we're saying is that in the particular context of Northern Ireland it's kind of understandable why they had that set of priorities."" Reacting to the report, Mr Byrne said he welcomed the findings and that the police would learn lessons. He added: ""I'd like to think we can move on now."" The chief constable repeated that he would not step down in the wake of unionist criticisms. ""If every time there's criticism, the chief, whoever it is, steps aside, we won't create continuity and we'll make that position, the office of chief constable, vulnerable, so I'm not resigning,"" he said. Speaking at a press conference on Monday afternoon, Mr Byrne explained that police would have been criticised if they had taken a different approach on the day of the funeral. ""Knowing what we know now, we would have been heavily criticised, even more heavily criticised, had we used force, for example, to try to block the Falls Road or indeed clear people from it. ""We have to police sensitively, proportionately, and within the law, and that's what we tried to do."" The justice minister, Mrs Long, said police have to deal with each set of circumstances based on the challenges that they anticipate. ""So it's not about policing everything the same way, it's about policing everything the way it needs to be policed in order to get as fair an outcome as possible,"" she said. ""I think that is what, by and large the PSNI has been found to do in this report."" DUP assembly member Mervyn Storey said the report was a ""missed opportunity for full accountability"" and that there should be a further investigation into the actions of the chief constable and senior officers. He added: ""It is now imperative that the Policing Board establishes a process to examine the impact of police failings on support for the police and rule of law, not just in the context of the Storey funeral but in relation to allegations of two-tier policing in the policing of parades and protests."" Ulster Unionist policing spokesman Mike Nesbitt called on the PSNI to ""review the nature of its relationship with Sinn FÃ©in"" and said there had been ""no winners from this entire process"". The SDLP's Dolores Kelly said the report ""confirms the invidious and impossible position that police officers were placed in during the Bobby Storey funeral"". Alliance Party Policing Board member John Blair said the report showed that ""reaction from some political quarters in relation to this funeral was disproportionate in the extreme"". Inspectors assessed whether the PSNI's approach ""was within the parameters of policing standards"" for the report. The report was published after Mr Parr, briefed Mrs Long and a closed-doors session of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.

"A woman is vaccinated in Ghana The international scheme to ensure equal access to Covid-19 vaccines is 140 million doses short because of India's continuing Covid crisis. The Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest single supplier to the Covax scheme, has made none of its planned shipments since exports were suspended in March. The UN children's agency Unicef buys and distributes vaccines for Covax. It is urging leaders of G7 nations and EU states to share their doses. They are due to meet in the UK next month. How India's vaccine drive went horribly wrong Extra $45bn needed for Covax plan to vaccinate poor Tracking vaccine progress around the world Unicef says data it has commissioned suggests that together this group of countries could donate around 153 million doses, while still meeting their commitments to vaccinate their own populations. The SII was due to supply around half of the two billion vaccines for Covax this year but there were no shipments for March, April or May. The shortfall is expected to rise to 190 million doses by the end of June. ""Unfortunately, we're in a situation where we just don't know when the next set of doses will materialise,"" said Gian Gandhi, Unicef's Covax co-ordinator for supply. Covax distribution in Nepal ""Our hope is, things will get back on track, but the situation in India is uncertainâ¦ and a huge concern."" Unicef is calling on the G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, as well as the EU, to donate their surplus supplies urgently. Some countries have ordered enough to vaccinate their population many times over, including the UK, US and Canada. In February British Prime MinisterBoris Johnson promised to donate most of the UK's surplus supplyto poorer countries but he has so far given no specific timescale. It is a similar story for the US. So far France is the only G7 country to donate doses in view of the crisis in India. Unicef said the rich and powerful G7 countries could make a huge dent in the vaccine deficit for poorer countries by donating 20% of their supplies in June, July and August, which would release around 153 million doses for the Covax scheme. France has pledged half a million doses by mid-June while Belgium has promised 100,000 from its domestic supply in the coming weeks. Spain, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates are some of the very few others pledging to share their supplies now. There are grave concerns that events in India could play out in other countries too - both near and far from the region. ""Cases are exploding and health systems are struggling in countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldivesâ¦ and also in Argentina and Brazil,"" said Unicef director Henrietta Fore. ""The cost for children and families will be incalculable."" Countries in Africa are some of the most reliant on doses through the Covax scheme. But, like in many parts of the world, there has also been hesitancy around receiving the vaccine among some communities. Another major challenge is physically getting the doses into people's arms - all that requires health workers to be specially trained and the vials to be transported to far-flung parts of countries where infrastructure can be limited. Some nations are now facing the prospect of deciding whether to give second doses to the most vulnerable who have already been given one jab or continue vaccinating more people as planned in the hope that the next shipments turn up soon.

"Bolton's vaccine hubs saw long queues across the weekend More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. The town has seen a sharp spike in infections since mid-April and the B.1.617.2 variant now makes up the majority of new cases. Prior to the push, about 10,000 people in the highest priority groups were yet to be vaccinated. Dr Helen Wall, who is leading the town's vaccine rollout, said it had been ""emotional"" to see. She said many who had been eligible for some time came for a jab over the last two days and she now hoped the programme had ""made a big dent"" in the list of outstanding eligible residents. Bolton recorded 733 new cases of Covid-19 in the seven days to 11 May - the highest anywhere in the UK, the latest data shows. However, the rate of new cases among people in the town aged 60 and over is just 59.9, up from 35.3 a week earlier. By contrast, the rate for those aged 10-19 in Bolton currently stands at 486.2 per 100,000, up sharply from 200.7 one week earlier, while for those aged 20-29 the rate has jumped from 147.9 to 310. The efforts to get everyone eligible vaccinated saw long queues form at vaccination hubs. BBC presenter and comedian Paddy McGuinness shared a video of the queues in his ""strong"" hometown on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite the concerns over the Indian variant,the easing of lockdown rules has gone ahead as plannedin England. The easing allows people to socialise indoors in limited numbers, hug loved ones and visit pubs and restaurants inside. Alex McVey, who runs Odessa cafe in Bolton, said trade had been OK since reopening at 7:00 BST but, due to Covid measures, he had reduced the number of seats from 72 to 22. ""It has been a lot different this morning. It has taken ages and ages to get set up and everything in place,"" he said. Mr McVey, who has been forced to make four members of staff redundant during the pandemic, said he was ""a little bit nervous"" about the reopening but remained hopeful. In Bolton, a big push to get more people vaccinated is bearing fruit. Health officials are targeting about 10,000 people who are eligible but have yet to come forward, but know that take-up of the vaccine in some parts of the town is lower than the national average. And they reject the charge that they are flouting the national rules on who can get a jab. In February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which sets the guidelines for the UK's vaccination roll-out - announced factors other than just health and age could be taken into account. So deprivation, ethnicity and living in a multi-generational household with older, vulnerable relatives could mean that younger people are eligible. This is not bending the rules, local leaders say. Rather, it is exactly what the rules are for. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday thata local lockdown in Bolton had not been ruled outdue to a rise in cases. He added that the ""vast majority"" of locals who had been hospitalised in recent days had not taken up the offer of a vaccine. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Early data suggests jabs work against India variant How much faster does the Indian variant spread? Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Dr Wall said the vaccination hubs were ""seeing people coming forward that clearly had the option to have the jab for some time - older people, disabled people - and they've chosen to come forward now"". ""I think in part that's because we brought this into the community as a trusted place, but also the things that are going on in Bolton are quite worrying for people,"" she said. ""I think that's given some push to people coming forward now for the vaccine."" Residents in Bolton lined up outside the mobile vaccination centre Surge testing has already begun in other areas of north-west England where cases involving the Indian variant are on the rise. The ""variant of concern"" has also been detected in Blackburn, Lancashire, which neighbours Bolton, and in Sefton on Merseyside. Blackburn with Darwen's public health directorsaid everyone over-18 should book a Covid vaccination in the area. But the prime minister's official spokesman said local areas should not vaccinate young people earlier than planned to stem the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus. He told a Westminster briefing  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had said the best way to protect against the new variant was to ensure vulnerable groups got their second dose of the vaccine.

"Television chef Nisha Katona says debt could push firms out of business Leisure firms say they need more support after a year of ""haemorrhaging cash"" and mounting debts due to the pandemic. Businesses from wine bars to bingo halls can reopen on Monday but at reduced capacity making it harder to cover their costs. Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he did not want rent arrears to ""cripple"" firms. He said the government was looking at ways to help firms manage their debts. While leisure venues, including soft play centres, amusement arcades and concert halls, are welcoming Monday's reopening, they know some customers will take longer to return to indoor activities, especially with the spread of the new Indian variant of the virus. Even if customer demand is high, venues can accommodate fewer customers at a time, due to social distancing rules. And according to the trade body UKHospitality, that sector alone has Â£2.5bn in rent arrears ""hanging around its neck"" as a result of the pandemic. ""Opening... will give us a certain amount of revenue, but we will still have half the number of covers we need to survive,"" says Nisha Katona, television presenter and founder of Indian restaurant chain Mowgli Street Food. She says her business has been lucky to have had a bit of financial ""breathing room"" to help it cope with lockdown, but it has still suffered. ""Cash has been haemorrhaging out of our account all the while we have no revenue, and yet we continue to pay rents,"" says Ms Katona. ""There are lots of business costs that don't go away, so while there has been no cash, we really have become a business that is on its knees, waiting for the resurrection."" Tenth of British restaurants lost during pandemic How many people can I meet in the pub? Indian variant could disrupt 21 June easing - PM She says the UK's high streets are already ""littered with the gravestones"" of independent bars and restaurants that didn't have backers with deep pockets or hadn't been able to negotiate concessions from their landlords. UKHospitality has called for ""a fair amount"" of rent debt to be written off and for a ban on business evictions, currently due to expire at the end of June, to be extended. The business minister, Mr Kwarteng, said the government was aware that businesses were facing a build-up in rent arrears after many months of not being able to trade normally. ""The government is working very closely together - the Treasury and [the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy] - to see if we can come up with an arrangement whereby tenants and landlords can work together to make sure this rent issue doesn't cripple business,"" he told the BBC. This is a big moment for the national mood and the UK economy - particularly those sectors which have been hardest hit by the restrictions. Nearly one million hospitality and leisure workers will go back to work today according to industry estimates. Although many have been open for outside service, 60% of hospitality venues have no outside space and have been unable to open till now. However, this is not the champagne moment many had hoped for. The real prize for businesses in hospitality and beyond was the planned removal of all restrictions on 21 June.  The recent increasing concerns and government warnings about the threat posed by the Indian variant to the reopening roadmap are casting an unwelcome cloud of uncertainty. Even with the restrictions being eased today, with the reintroduction of seated indoor drinking and dining, many businesses will still be unable to operate anywhere near pre-pandemic capacity and will be facing the prospect of deferred rent bills, the repayment of Covid loans and an increasingly acute staff shortage as hospitality workers who left the industry don't yet feel confident enough to return. A separate report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said employers would have to improve pay and working conditions to get the staff they need. Stephen Burns, chief executive of the Hollywood Bowl Group, which runs bowling and mini-golf sites throughout the UK, said his venues had only been able to trade for seven or eight of the past 62 weeks, costing the business Â£100m in lost revenue, during which time bills had mounted. ""Whilst we are incredibly grateful for the support that we have seen from the government, there has still been the cost of keeping our team members on furlough, as well as paying our rent, service charges and utility bills, so it has had a significant impact on our cashflows."" He said maintaining the furlough scheme had cost the firm Â£100,000 a week. Hollywood Bowl had been able to engage with its landlords, something that wasn't happening across all areas of the leisure sector, he added. Hollywood Bowl is keen to get back to pre-Covid levels of business After reopening, the bowling alleys would only run at half capacity, said Mr Burns, until measures to curb the pandemic end altogether, currently scheduled for 21 June, according to the government's roadmap. However that date has now been thrown into doubt. The government has said it will make a decision on 14 June about whether the final easing of restrictions can go ahead. Ms Katona said many businesses would make little or no profit while capacity was still restricted. ""In order to survive, what needs to happen is that we need to trade at the levels that we were trading prior to Covid,"" she said. ""While social distancing is in place we cannot do that. Many places will not be able to make any kind of profit while restrictions are in place."" She fears many businesses will go bankrupt in the Autumn as landlords demand rent arrears and says the government should look at things like business rates and VAT rates as well as support with debts due to landlords. Mr Kwarteng said he hoped the final lifting of restrictions, including ending the need to distance indoors, would go ahead in June, but that he couldn't offer any ""cast iron guarantees"".

"Long working hours are killing hundreds of thousands of people a year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The first global study of its kind showed 745,000 people died in 2016 from stroke and heart disease due to long hours. The report found that people living in South East Asia and the Western Pacific region were the most affected. The WHO also said the trend may worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic. 'I was working 72 hours a week - it was cult-like' Go 'extra mile' despite 95-hour week - Goldman boss Goldman Sachs bankers ask for 80-hour week cap The research found that working 55 hours or more a week was associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from heart disease, compared with a working week of 35 to 40 hours. The study, conducted with the International Labour Organization,external(ILO), also showed almost three quarters of those that died as a result of working long hours were middle-aged or older men. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the long hours were worked. Five weeks ago,a post on LinkedIn,externalfrom 45-year-old Jonathan Frostick gained widespread publicity as he described how he'd  had a wake-up call over long working hours. The regulatory programme manager working for HSBC had just sat down on a Sunday afternoon to prepare for the working week ahead when he felt a tightness in his chest, a throbbing in his throat, jawline and arm, and difficulty breathing. ""I got to the bedroom so I could lie down, and got the attention of my wife who phoned 999,"" he said. While recovering from his heart-attack, Mr Frostick decided to restructure his approach to work. ""I'm not spending all day on Zoom anymore,"" he said. His post struck a chord with hundreds of readers, who shared their experiences of overwork and the impact on their health. Mr Frostick doesn't blame his employer for the long hours he was putting in, but one respondent said: ""Companies continue to push people to their limits without concern for your personal well-being."" HSBC said everyone at the bank wished Mr Frostick a full and speedy recovery. ""We also recognise the importance of personal health and wellbeing and a good work-life balance.  Over the last year we have redoubled our efforts on health and wellbeing. ""The response to this topic shows how much this is on people's minds and we are encouraging everyone to make their health and wellbeing a top priority."" While the WHO study did not cover the period of the pandemic, WHO officials said the recent jump in remote working and the economic slowdown may have increased the risks associated with long working hours. ""We have some evidence that shows that when countries go into national lockdown, the number of hours worked increase by about 10%,"" WHO technical officer Frank Pega said. The report said working long hours was estimated to be responsible for about a third of all work-related disease, making it the largest occupational disease burden. The researchers said that there were two ways longer working hours led to poor health outcomes: firstly through direct physiological responses to stress, and secondly because longer hours meant workers were more likely to adopt health-harming behaviours such as tobacco and alcohol use, less sleep and exercise, and an unhealthy diet. Andrew Falls, 32, a service engineer based in Leeds, says the long hours at his previous employer took a toll on his mental and physical health. ""Fifty to 55 hour weeks were the norm. I was also away from home for weeks on end."" Andrew Falls says being sent to jobs away from home with little notice added to the pressure of his work ""Stress, depression, anxiety, it was a cauldron of bad feedback loops,"" he says. ""I was in a constant state of being run down."" After five years he left the job to retrain as a software engineer.

"Bolton's vaccine hubs saw long queues across the weekend More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. The town has seen a sharp spike in infections since mid-April and the B.1.617.2 variant now makes up the majority of new cases. Prior to the push, about 10,000 people in the highest priority groups were yet to be vaccinated. Dr Helen Wall, who is leading the town's vaccine rollout, said it had been ""emotional"" to see. She said many who had been eligible for some time came for a jab over the last two days and she now hoped the programme had ""made a big dent"" in the list of outstanding eligible residents. Bolton recorded 733 new cases of Covid-19 in the seven days to 11 May - the highest anywhere in the UK, the latest data shows. However, the rate of new cases among people in the town aged 60 and over is just 59.9, up from 35.3 a week earlier. By contrast, the rate for those aged 10-19 in Bolton currently stands at 486.2 per 100,000, up sharply from 200.7 one week earlier, while for those aged 20-29 the rate has jumped from 147.9 to 310. The efforts to get everyone eligible vaccinated saw long queues form at vaccination hubs. BBC presenter and comedian Paddy McGuinness shared a video of the queues in his ""strong"" hometown on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite the concerns over the Indian variant,the easing of lockdown rules has gone ahead as plannedin England. The easing allows people to socialise indoors in limited numbers, hug loved ones and visit pubs and restaurants inside. Alex McVey, who runs Odessa cafe in Bolton, said trade had been OK since reopening at 7:00 BST but, due to Covid measures, he had reduced the number of seats from 72 to 22. ""It has been a lot different this morning. It has taken ages and ages to get set up and everything in place,"" he said. Mr McVey, who has been forced to make four members of staff redundant during the pandemic, said he was ""a little bit nervous"" about the reopening but remained hopeful. In Bolton, a big push to get more people vaccinated is bearing fruit. Health officials are targeting about 10,000 people who are eligible but have yet to come forward, but know that take-up of the vaccine in some parts of the town is lower than the national average. And they reject the charge that they are flouting the national rules on who can get a jab. In February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which sets the guidelines for the UK's vaccination roll-out - announced factors other than just health and age could be taken into account. So deprivation, ethnicity and living in a multi-generational household with older, vulnerable relatives could mean that younger people are eligible. This is not bending the rules, local leaders say. Rather, it is exactly what the rules are for. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday thata local lockdown in Bolton had not been ruled outdue to a rise in cases. He added that the ""vast majority"" of locals who had been hospitalised in recent days had not taken up the offer of a vaccine. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Early data suggests jabs work against India variant How much faster does the Indian variant spread? Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Dr Wall said the vaccination hubs were ""seeing people coming forward that clearly had the option to have the jab for some time - older people, disabled people - and they've chosen to come forward now"". ""I think in part that's because we brought this into the community as a trusted place, but also the things that are going on in Bolton are quite worrying for people,"" she said. ""I think that's given some push to people coming forward now for the vaccine."" Residents in Bolton lined up outside the mobile vaccination centre Surge testing has already begun in other areas of north-west England where cases involving the Indian variant are on the rise. The ""variant of concern"" has also been detected in Blackburn, Lancashire, which neighbours Bolton, and in Sefton on Merseyside. Blackburn with Darwen's public health directorsaid everyone over-18 should book a Covid vaccination in the area. But the prime minister's official spokesman said local areas should not vaccinate young people earlier than planned to stem the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus. He told a Westminster briefing  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had said the best way to protect against the new variant was to ensure vulnerable groups got their second dose of the vaccine.

"UK plastic waste is being exported to Turkey and then illegally dumped and burned, according to areport,external. Greenpeace said about 40% - or 210,000 tonnes - of the UK's plastic waste exports were sent to Turkey last year. But rather than being recycled, investigators saw some of it dumped by roads, in fields and in waterways. The UK is a ""global leader in tackling plastic pollution"", the government said - after Greenpeace called for it to ""take control"" of the problem. Greenpeace's report warned Turkey was becoming Europe's ""largest plastic waste dump"". The charity said it had investigated 10 sites across southern Turkey and found plastic bags and packaging from UK supermarkets and retailers at all of them. Packaging for a coronavirus antigen test was also found, indicating the waste was less than a year old, the report said. Where the UK's recycling really goes The UK generates more plastic waste per person than any other country apart from the US, the report added. Turkey, Malaysia and Poland received the largest amounts of plastic waste exports from the UK in 2020. Last year, the dumping of plastic waste in Turkey wasthe subject of a BBC investigation. Correspondent Angus Crawford sorted through piles of plastic bags, bottles and packaging left by the roadside. This video can not be played The UK sends more plastic waste to Turkey than to any other country, but not all of it gets recycled Turkey received nearly 40% of the UK's plastic waste exports in 2020 - an increase by a factor of 18 since 2016, when 12,000 tonnes were sent. European Union member states also sent 20 times more plastic waste to Turkey last year compared to 2016. Nihan Temiz Atas, biodiversity projects lead from Greenpeace Mediterranean, based in Turkey, said: ""Around 241 truckloads of plastic waste come to Turkey every day from across Europe and it overwhelms us. ""As far as we can see from the data and the field, we continue to be Europe's largest plastic waste dump."" Nina Schrank, senior plastics campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the crux of the problem was overproduction, and urged the government to ban plastic waste exports and reduce single-use plastic by 50% by 2025. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We are clear that the UK should handle more of its waste at home, and that's why we are committed to banning the export of plastic waste to non-OECD countries and clamping down on illegal waste exports - including to countries such as Turkey - through tougher controls. ""The UK is a global leader in tackling plastic pollution and our proposals for extended producer responsibility for packaging, a plastic packaging tax and mandatory electronic waste tracking will boost recycling rates, reduce waste and cut crime."" Many wealthy countries send recyclable waste overseas as it is financially cheap, reduces domestic landfill and can help areas achieve recycling targets. Last year, Malaysia's environment minister said the government had sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally imported plastic waste to their country of origin - 42 of which belonged to the UK. Yeo Bee Yin said the move was to ensure the South East Asia nation did not become""the garbage dump of the world"".

"Violence between Israelis and Palestinians shows little sign of easing despite calls for calm Israel conducts dozens more air strikes on Gaza as the militants continue to fire rockets into southern Israel A top Islamic Jihad commander is thought to be among the Palestinian militants killed on Monday The US urges both sides to protect civilians and says it is focusing on ""quiet, intensive diplomacy"" But the US again blocks a UN Security Council resolution calling for a halt to the fighting The violence has entered its second week and killed more than 200 people in Gaza and 10 in Israel We are now pausing our live coverage - thanks for joining us today.

Medics say Gaza's hospitals are being stretched further as a result of the conflict Gaza's hospitals are being stretched to collapse as a result of airstrikes, a doctor has told the BBC. Health officials in the Gaza Strip are making urgent appeals for supplies, amid reports of power blackouts and sewage running on to streets. The health system had already been struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic before the conflict erupted last week, and how they are ""suffering"" further, Dr Mohammad Abu Rayya, a paediatrician, toldthe BBC's Newshour programme. ""The situation in Gaza is becoming worse and worse - the health system is being collapsed and stretched,"" he said. ""Day by day we receiving emergency cases, causalty cases, we are receiving dead bodies. We don't have a morgue big enough for the killed and dead bodies."" Earlier today, the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for health workers to be protected. Left: The current Google Earth image of Hanadi tower in Gaza; right: a high-resolution satellite image showing the tower destroyed Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world, but why does it appear blurry on Google Maps? The issue has been highlighted by researchers who use open-source, publicly available information - including mapping data - to locate attacks and document the destruction. ""The fact that we don't get high-resolution satellite images from Israel and Palestinian territories sets us back,"" said Samir, one of the investigators. Read BBC Reality Check's full explanation of why this is. US President Joe Biden says he is speaking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu within the hour, amid a flurry of diplomatic calls to try to end the crisis. Asked if he would join other international calls for a ceasefire in Israel, president Biden said: ""I will be speaking with the prime minister in an hour and I'll be able to talk to you after that."" US officials have held over 60 calls with Middle East counterparts aimed at de-escalating the violence, according to the White House press spokesperson. They include National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaking to counterparts in Israel and Egypt and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan and Tunisia. Other countries are also trying to find a diplomatic solution. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says he's spoken to foreign minister in Jordan and Turkey to find an ""urgent end to the violence"".

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his US counterpart Joe Biden has ""bloody hands"" because of his support for Israel. He criticised the US president over US media reports that the Biden administration has approved a new $735m (Â£510m) arms sale to Israel. ""You are writing history with your bloody hands,"" president Erdogan said in a nationally televised address. The Turkish president has been a vocal champion for the Palestinian cause during his 18 years in power. Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza as part of Operation Protective Edge The current flare-up of violence is the worst between Israel and Palestinians since 2014. So what exactly happened back then? After weeks of growing tension - which included the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers - Israel launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July, which it said was aimed at stopping rocket attacks from Gaza and destroying Hamas's capabilities. Over the next seven weeks, Israel carried out thousands of air strikes and launched a ground operation to destroy tunnel networks in Gaza. Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Eventually a truce was declared, brokered by Egypt. UN investigators said that 2,251 Palestinians died, of whom 1,462 were civilians, while on the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. A UN human rights investigationsaid there was evidence of ""serious violations"" by both sides. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki says a lot of work is going on behind the scenes Speaking at the daily White House briefing, President Biden's spokesperson Jen Psaki has defended the US government's approach to the conflict. The White House is coming under pressure from some in the Democratic Party to call for a ceasefire. Earlier today, a group of Democratic senators called for a ceasefire to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence."" And as we reported earlier, the US blocked a UN motion that called for an end to fighting. Asked why the US hasn't called for a ceasefire yet, Jen Psaki said that a lot of diplomatic activity was going on behind the scenes ""The role we are playing, the prism we are making all of our decisions through, is how can we help bring an end to the violence and bringing an end to, de-escalate the situation on the ground,"" she said. ""Our approach is through quiet, intensive diplomacy, and that's where we feel we can be the most effective."" Israel says its air strikes are not aimed at Gaza's civilian population A teacher from Gaza has told BBC OS that life in the Palestinian territory is ""extremely frightening"". ""Everything for us is really scary,"" said Hanan, 26. ""Whenever we hear a car... or a motorbike, we feel scared that maybe they will strike this car or strike this person who is inside the car. So it's very frightening for us, we can't sleep. ""It's really hard when we hear an air strike. The first thing we do is gather together as a family and find the safest place, but there's no safe place when there's an air strike. We gather together and my mother says all the time, 'if we're going to die let us die together'."" Hanan added: ""We are losing more people, people who we love. We are suffering every day in Gaza. We are in a very big jail together, so living here is so hard."" The United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss how to ""calm the situation"". The pair discussed âways to reduce tensions and strengthen global efforts to stop the acts of violence in Israel and Palestine,â state media reports. The UAE is among Arab nations who have found themselves in a tricky situation as the conflict has worsened. The country recently signed an agreement to normalise their relations with Israel. But as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues, the improvement in relations has been put on hold. Members of the UN Security Council met virtually on Sunday The US has blocked a joint UN Security Council statement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the third time in a week, according to diplomats. The text, which was drawn up by China, Tunisia and Norway, called for the ""cessation of violence and respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, especially children"". It was due to be approved by the council's 15 members on Monday but the US said it ""could not currently support an expression"", a diplomat told AFP news agency. The security council met online on Sunday after the US - a staunch ally of Israel -  delayed a session planned for Friday. The Israeli military says its fighter jets have bombed the  headquarters of Hamas's internal security operations in the northern Gaza Strip. In a statement quoted by Israeli media, the Israel Defense Forces said the building was ""a central terror infrastructure of Hamas, from which the organisation's military intelligence operates"". There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air strike.

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is in Paris for a summit hosted by Emmanuel Macron France and Egypt are the latest nations to call for an end to the violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron and his Egyptian
counterpart, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, said they âshare a deep worry about the
ongoing escalation of violence and deplore the many civilian victimsâ, the ÃlysÃ©e
Palace said in a statement. They also agreed to co-ordinate efforts towards brokering
âa rapid ceasefireâ, with officials from Egypt, Qatar, the US and the UN working
to end the crisis. The Egyptian president is in Paris to attend a summit on

This video can not be played Watch: How the tower block collapsed after strike A reporter with the Al-Jazeera news outlet has been describing what it was like to flee the tower block in Gaza where her organisation's offices were based,moments before it collapsed after being hit in an Israeli air strike on Saturday. Youmna Al-Sayed said they had been given a one-hour warning by Israel on to evacuate the 12-storey building, prompting a scramble to make it out. ""We know that when we get an evacuation call, we need to act
quickly because they might target the building at any time,"" she told theBBC's Newshour programme. ""Everyone was running around, on the
stairs in the elevators, grabbing their kit, grabbing our cameras, whatever we
could get with us, and running quickly, which was really traumatising for us."" ""Iâve seen lots of buildings being targeted and brought down -
but when itâs your house or your buildingâ¦ itâs really devastating.â Gazaâs Hamas-run health ministry says 200 people have now
been killed there in Israeli strikes since the hostilities between Palestinian militants
and Israel began a week ago. A statement adds that 59 children and 35 women are among
the dead, and that 1,305 other people have been injured. Israelâs military says it has killed more
than 130 militants in Gaza. Ten people, including two children and one soldier, have also been killed in Israel as a result of rockets fired by militants in Gaza in the
same period. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin Most of the protests in Germany were peaceful German politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned anti-Semitic slogans and chants at recent pro-Palestinian protests and outside synagogues. Last night a Jewish cemetery in Berlin was desecrated with green paint. Over the weekend there were about a dozen pro-Palestinian protests across Germany and there were reports of anti-Semitic chants and placards. In at least two cases Jewish people were attacked. Most protests remained peaceful, but there were clashes when police tried to stop one protest because Covid restrictions were not being respected. Over the past week Israeli flags have been burnt outside at least three synagogues. Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, president of the Bundestag, described the images of anti-Semitics slogans at the protests as ""unbearable"". Israel's military said on Monday that it had destroyed 15km (nine miles) of tunnels used by Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip. Tunnel systems used by jihadist fighters have long been an important target for Israeli air raids. Their construction began nearly two decades ago, along the border with Egypt, in order to smuggle weapons and other goods.

Since then, tunnels have also been dug beneath the Gaza-Israel border allowing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters to emerge behind Israeli border guards. The underground systems protect the militants' command structures while their fighters conduct operations against Israeli forces. Many of the tunnels - usually about 65ft (20m) deep - are interconnected with multiple camouflaged openings to emerge above ground in different locations. To keep the system hidden, the entrances are mostly located on the bottom floor of houses, mosques, schools or other public buildings. Read more:Inside Gaza's tunnels Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK plastic waste is being exported to Turkey and then illegally dumped and burned, according to areport,external. Greenpeace said about 40% - or 210,000 tonnes - of the UK's plastic waste exports were sent to Turkey last year. But rather than being recycled, investigators saw some of it dumped by roads, in fields and in waterways. The UK is a ""global leader in tackling plastic pollution"", the government said - after Greenpeace called for it to ""take control"" of the problem. Greenpeace's report warned Turkey was becoming Europe's ""largest plastic waste dump"". The charity said it had investigated 10 sites across southern Turkey and found plastic bags and packaging from UK supermarkets and retailers at all of them. Packaging for a coronavirus antigen test was also found, indicating the waste was less than a year old, the report said. Where the UK's recycling really goes The UK generates more plastic waste per person than any other country apart from the US, the report added. Turkey, Malaysia and Poland received the largest amounts of plastic waste exports from the UK in 2020. Last year, the dumping of plastic waste in Turkey wasthe subject of a BBC investigation. Correspondent Angus Crawford sorted through piles of plastic bags, bottles and packaging left by the roadside. This video can not be played The UK sends more plastic waste to Turkey than to any other country, but not all of it gets recycled Turkey received nearly 40% of the UK's plastic waste exports in 2020 - an increase by a factor of 18 since 2016, when 12,000 tonnes were sent. European Union member states also sent 20 times more plastic waste to Turkey last year compared to 2016. Nihan Temiz Atas, biodiversity projects lead from Greenpeace Mediterranean, based in Turkey, said: ""Around 241 truckloads of plastic waste come to Turkey every day from across Europe and it overwhelms us. ""As far as we can see from the data and the field, we continue to be Europe's largest plastic waste dump."" Nina Schrank, senior plastics campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the crux of the problem was overproduction, and urged the government to ban plastic waste exports and reduce single-use plastic by 50% by 2025. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We are clear that the UK should handle more of its waste at home, and that's why we are committed to banning the export of plastic waste to non-OECD countries and clamping down on illegal waste exports - including to countries such as Turkey - through tougher controls. ""The UK is a global leader in tackling plastic pollution and our proposals for extended producer responsibility for packaging, a plastic packaging tax and mandatory electronic waste tracking will boost recycling rates, reduce waste and cut crime."" Many wealthy countries send recyclable waste overseas as it is financially cheap, reduces domestic landfill and can help areas achieve recycling targets. Last year, Malaysia's environment minister said the government had sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally imported plastic waste to their country of origin - 42 of which belonged to the UK. Yeo Bee Yin said the move was to ensure the South East Asia nation did not become""the garbage dump of the world"".

round-up of the main headlines today: A cyclone, classified as ""extremely severe"", has made landfall in India's western state of Gujarat with wind speeds of up to 160km/h (100mph). Cyclone Tauktae travelled along India's western coast, narrowly missing the city of Mumbai. At 12 people were killed and 150,000 evacuated. The navy has sent three warships to try to rescue hundreds of people stranded off the coast in two barges. The cyclone comes amid a Covid-19 wave that has overwhelmed Indian hospitals. Tauktae is the strongest cyclone to strike the region since 1998 and both Gujarat and neighbouring Maharashtra have been on high alert. Although Covid cases are declining in both states, the devastating effects of India's second wave are still being felt. Read more here. In a land renowned for its castles, the drawbridges were finally back down, and gates lifted across Wales today. Welsh historic monuments body Cadw is responsible for maintaining 44 major castles including Caernarfon, Conwy, and Caerphilly. ""We are delighted to invite visitors back to more of our much-loved heritage sites across Wales,"" said its head, Gwilym Hughes. Many of the 427 castles sites scattered across Wales have welcomed back visitors for the first time in months. It included Pembroke Castle, which is run by a charity, where Caroline Holt was able to show 18-month old Henry the room where Henry VII was born. Setting up a business is never easy, so what is it like to set up a restaurant with the added complications of a global pandemic and restrictions? As restaurants reopened inside today, Graham Rebak, co-owner of new restaurant HUÅ in Chelsea, told the BBC about the hurdles he'd faced over the past year. ""Since we found the site in April 2020 it's been difficult all the way through. Finding tradesmen, craftsmen, builders to do the project was fraught with difficulty. ""And there were some times where you had to shut the premises because there was a fear there might have been an outbreak,"" he says. ""But we've battled through it and now we're hopefully looking forward to opening on 1 June."" Graham says he has also noticed fewer people are replying to job adverts, something he has put down to many people moving out of the city during the pandemic. ""In normal times... you'd have hundreds of responses but now we're seeing far fewer responses, so it's proving difficult, but we're slowly getting there."" US President Joe Biden has pledged to send a further 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to other countries by the end of June, marking the first time the United States has agreed to share vaccines authorised for domestic use. The US has previouslyagreed to give 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine- which is not yet approved for use in the US - to other countries. Biden has been under global pressure to share his country's vaccines, but he had insisted that he had to first control the pandemic at home. He announced today that the US would share its doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines when they ""become available"". ""These are vaccinations and vaccines that are authorised to be put in arms of Americans, and by the end of June, when we will have taken delivery of enough such vaccines to protect everyone in the United States, the United States will share at least 20 million of those doses, that extra supply, with other countries."" He added in atweet:,external""America will never be fully safe while this pandemic is raging globally... It is the right thing to do. It is the smart thing to do. It is the strong thing to do. The move was welcomed by the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, whoresponded:,external""Your commitment to global health is deeply appreciated.""

""The weather has been absolutely heinous so I was looking forward to not being freezing,"" says Sean. Disappointments aside, Sean says that living with restrictions in Scotland has become the ""new normal"" and that she believes the decision to keep Glasgow in higher restrictions - along with Moray - was the right one. Johanna added: ""The response was really quick. I'm getting my vaccine earlier because of that and it shows there is some responsibility there. It makes you feel safer knowing they've made that decision."" BBC Radio 5 Live We've been hearing today about concerns around the Indian virus variant in Bolton and Blackburn. And how testing and vaccination is being sped up there, while testing is also surged in Bedford. More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. 21-year-old Bolton resident Josie (pictured) took up the offer of a vaccine after the roll-out scheme was extended to all over-16s in the badly affected BL3 area. Josie told BBC Radio 5 Live's Rachel Burden today: ""Iâve wanted it for so long so I thought Iâll just go down and see if theyâll let me and thankfully they did."" Josie works in a supermarket and says even though staff wear masks and regularly sanitise, she does worry about her customers and feels âmore comfortable serving them now Iâve got the vaccine"". âItâs been really hard being in the lockdown for so long like we have in Bolton, everyone has been clinging to that hope of going outside,"" she said. ""I think the vaccine is going to help us stay on track for that, so long as everyone gets it."" Watch the interviewhere,external. GP and clinical director of Rumworth in Bolton, Dr Saveena Ghaie, spoke to 5 Liveâs Nicky Campbell about whatâs happening in the area. ""A lot of our residents live in multi-generational households, a lot of those young people might be passing it on to their elderly relatives. ""They were so pleased to have the jab that they really didnât mind waiting in that wet weather,"" she said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the ""vast majority"" of Bolton locals who had been hospitalised in recent days had not taken up their offer of a vaccine, including people in intensive care. Dr Ghaie said she thinks that's due to ""a lack of information or maybe scaremongering"".

Hotels have to adhere to capacity rules but many are full, with excited guests turning up hours before their check-in times. Nigel Seddon, who owns the family-run Elgin Hotel said while dealing with the lockdowns had been an ""emotional rollercoaster"", it was a pleasure to all be ""back together"" and seeing ""so many familiar faces"". Brookie Simkiss, who had travelled to the hotel from Walsall in the West Midlands, said she had not been able to get her four-year-old to sleep on Sunday night because he was ""so excited"" to be going to the seaside. ""Daryan can't wait to go swimming and to the beach [and] we've booked the zoo tomorrow,"" the 28-year-old said. And Joan Pilkington, 83, who lives on her own in Shepley, West Yorkshire, said she was elated to be back in the resort as living under lockdown had been ""terrible"".

Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Andreia Rocha and her husband Rui Silva We've been bringing you updates from Portugal today, where tourists from the UK have been able to head to once more. It's a big change - boat tour operator Andreia Rocha has spotted many more dolphins than Brits along the Algarve this year. Sheâs really struggled to keep her business going during Covid and feared it would go under. She and her husband, who pilots their 12-seater boat, have had plenty of time to look after their newborn baby, but no income from customers. In the good times, 90% of their tickets were bought by the British, and she tells us sheâs ecstatic that UK tourists are starting to come back. Sheâs already receiving bookings online. Two of their customers could well be Amanda and Peter Tyler, who flew into Faro earlier today. ""Weâve been waiting for this for six months,"" Amanda tells us at arrivals. They and all the British visitors who touched down today are now heading for their hotels and apartments - and they found the beaches much quieter than usual. The Algarve is waking up â and there is real excitement - but this is by no means a return to normal. File photo of Thai detainees in a local jail Thailand has seen its highest number of daily Covid cases, with the majority of the new infections stemming from the country's overcrowded prisons. Some 6,853 prisoners make up for 9,635 of Monday's new cases - more than double the previous daily record. Thailand admitted there were growing clusters in jails after several prominent activists tested positive. The country has managed to keep coronavirus numbers low for the last year, but saw a huge spike last month. A total of 111,082 cases have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous highest daily total was 4,887 on 13 May, according to Johns Hopkins University. It also reported 25 new deaths on Monday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 614. Read more Euphoria at the return of indoor hospitality and hugging has not reached every part of Scotland. While most of the country went into level two and most islands skipped to level one, Glasgow and Moray remain under tighter restrictions. It means bars and restaurants in those two areas will not be able to serve alcohol indoors and they will have to close their doors to indoor diners at 20:00. The latest figures show thatCovid infections are continuing to rise in Glasgow,with weekly case rates now at 100.3 per 100,000 people, with indications they may rise further. The number of weekly cases per 100,000 people is a key indicator for the Scottish government when judging what level of restrictions an area should be under. Moray's rate for the 14 May was 55.2, but that now appears to be falling. Donald Macleod, convenor of the Glasgow Licensing Forum, believes hospitality is being ""treated with contempt"". ""I am happy for those who can open but I feel desperately sad and sorry for all those in Glasgow on what should have been a happy Monday, which has become a very blue, dank, dreary Monday,"" he says. ""Cases go up but mortality rates don't, hospital admissions don't and yet we are locked down. There is no run on the NHS. We should not be shutting down an economy, a whole city.

then closed, or had to manage the rule of six, or make sure people were family

Abi Morgan and Luke Hinojosa planned to marry last June, but were forced to postpone due to Covid restrictions. They got married earlier today at the White Hart Hotel in Lincolnafter rules were eased, allowing up to 30 people to attend a wedding ceremony. Abi said she felt a sense of relief as well as being delighted that they were finally able to tie the knot. ""It's [the pandemic] put our lives on hold,"" she said. Luke said: ""Everything pretty much stopped, waiting for the day to finally be here, but we feel like we can carry on with life now as husband and wife,"" ""I have a wife now,"" he added. They said they were also looking forward to spending their wedding night away from home. Luke said: ""It's going to be strange because we haven't been able to stay anywhere for months, [but] we are looking forward to a good night away."" Around 4,500 supporters were admitted for Barnsley's play-off match against Swansea this evening There are big changes happening in spectator sport today asup to 10,000 fans will be allowedto return to Englandâs outdoor sports venues. The latest easing of Covid rules means home fans will able to watch the final two rounds of this seasonâs Premier League from the stands as stadiums reopen with reduced capacity. The final two rounds of matches will be played on 18-19 May and 23 May. Up to 2,000 fans were allowed at a number of Premier League matches in December, the last time fans were in attendance at top-flight games, before the country went back into lockdown. Fans also returned for Newcastle's rugby union match with Northampton Up to 10,000 fans or 25% capacity, whichever figure is lower, will be allowed at larger outdoor venues, while at smaller outdoor venues, the limit will be capped at 4,000 or 50% capacity. At indoor venues, the cap will be 1,000 or 50%, whichever is lowest. Fans returned for todayâs rugby union fixtures between Newcastle Falcons and Northampton Saints as well as Bristol v Gloucester; while spectators will be allowed back into cricket grounds for the round of County Championship matches that begins on 19 and 20 May.

so important,â she says. âWe hug for at least 20 seconds which releases
happiness hormones in our body. We feel this burst of joy. Itâs so precious. âDuring the pandemic, a lot of
people have been alone for long periods of time. Many couldnât visit family and
even had to say goodbye to loved ones who passed away."" Earlier, she met some friends outdoors for some hugs. âNow weâre coming through

round-up of the main headlines today: A cyclone, classified as ""extremely severe"", has made landfall in India's western state of Gujarat with wind speeds of up to 160km/h (100mph). Cyclone Tauktae travelled along India's western coast, narrowly missing the city of Mumbai. At 12 people were killed and 150,000 evacuated. The navy has sent three warships to try to rescue hundreds of people stranded off the coast in two barges. The cyclone comes amid a Covid-19 wave that has overwhelmed Indian hospitals. Tauktae is the strongest cyclone to strike the region since 1998 and both Gujarat and neighbouring Maharashtra have been on high alert. Although Covid cases are declining in both states, the devastating effects of India's second wave are still being felt. Read more here. In a land renowned for its castles, the drawbridges were finally back down, and gates lifted across Wales today. Welsh historic monuments body Cadw is responsible for maintaining 44 major castles including Caernarfon, Conwy, and Caerphilly. ""We are delighted to invite visitors back to more of our much-loved heritage sites across Wales,"" said its head, Gwilym Hughes. Many of the 427 castles sites scattered across Wales have welcomed back visitors for the first time in months. It included Pembroke Castle, which is run by a charity, where Caroline Holt was able to show 18-month old Henry the room where Henry VII was born. Setting up a business is never easy, so what is it like to set up a restaurant with the added complications of a global pandemic and restrictions? As restaurants reopened inside today, Graham Rebak, co-owner of new restaurant HUÅ in Chelsea, told the BBC about the hurdles he'd faced over the past year. ""Since we found the site in April 2020 it's been difficult all the way through. Finding tradesmen, craftsmen, builders to do the project was fraught with difficulty. ""And there were some times where you had to shut the premises because there was a fear there might have been an outbreak,"" he says. ""But we've battled through it and now we're hopefully looking forward to opening on 1 June."" Graham says he has also noticed fewer people are replying to job adverts, something he has put down to many people moving out of the city during the pandemic. ""In normal times... you'd have hundreds of responses but now we're seeing far fewer responses, so it's proving difficult, but we're slowly getting there."" US President Joe Biden has pledged to send a further 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to other countries by the end of June, marking the first time the United States has agreed to share vaccines authorised for domestic use. The US has previouslyagreed to give 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine- which is not yet approved for use in the US - to other countries. Biden has been under global pressure to share his country's vaccines, but he had insisted that he had to first control the pandemic at home. He announced today that the US would share its doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines when they ""become available"". ""These are vaccinations and vaccines that are authorised to be put in arms of Americans, and by the end of June, when we will have taken delivery of enough such vaccines to protect everyone in the United States, the United States will share at least 20 million of those doses, that extra supply, with other countries."" He added in atweet:,external""America will never be fully safe while this pandemic is raging globally... It is the right thing to do. It is the smart thing to do. It is the strong thing to do. The move was welcomed by the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, whoresponded:,external""Your commitment to global health is deeply appreciated.""

I have missed this more than the shops,"" says Mrs Lusher. ""I would rather come here than go shopping."" ""It is the biggest thing I've missed during lockdown,"" says Mr Lusher.

And how testing and vaccination is being sped up there, while testing is also surged in Bedford. More than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend amid concerns over the Indian Covid-19 variant. 21-year-old Bolton resident Josie (pictured) took up the offer of a vaccine after the roll-out scheme was extended to all over-16s in the badly affected BL3 area. Josie told BBC Radio 5 Live's Rachel Burden today: ""Iâve wanted it for so long so I thought Iâll just go down and see if theyâll let me and thankfully they did."" Josie works in a supermarket and says even though staff wear masks and regularly sanitise, she does worry about her customers and feels âmore comfortable serving them now Iâve got the vaccine"". âItâs been really hard being in the lockdown for so long like we have in Bolton, everyone has been clinging to that hope of going outside,"" she said.

Brookie Simkiss, who had travelled to the hotel from Walsall in the West Midlands, said she had not been able to get her four-year-old to sleep on Sunday night because he was ""so excited"" to be going to the seaside.

Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Andreia Rocha and her husband Rui Silva We've been bringing you updates from Portugal today, where tourists from the UK have been able to head to once more. It's a big change - boat tour operator Andreia Rocha has spotted many more dolphins than Brits along the Algarve this year. Sheâs really struggled to keep her business going during Covid and feared it would go under. She and her husband, who pilots their 12-seater boat, have had plenty of time to look after their newborn baby, but no income from customers. In the good times, 90% of their tickets were bought by the British, and she tells us sheâs ecstatic that UK tourists are starting to come back. Sheâs already receiving bookings online. Two of their customers could well be Amanda and Peter Tyler, who flew into Faro earlier today. ""Weâve been waiting for this for six months,"" Amanda tells us at arrivals. They and all the British visitors who touched down today are now heading for their hotels and apartments - and they found the beaches much quieter than usual. The Algarve is waking up â and there is real excitement - but this is by no means a return to normal. File photo of Thai detainees in a local jail Thailand has seen its highest number of daily Covid cases, with the majority of the new infections stemming from the country's overcrowded prisons. Some 6,853 prisoners make up for 9,635 of Monday's new cases - more than double the previous daily record. Thailand admitted there were growing clusters in jails after several prominent activists tested positive. The country has managed to keep coronavirus numbers low for the last year, but saw a huge spike last month. A total of 111,082 cases have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous highest daily total was 4,887 on 13 May, according to Johns Hopkins University. It also reported 25 new deaths on Monday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 614. Read more Euphoria at the return of indoor hospitality and hugging has not reached every part of Scotland. While most of the country went into level two and most islands skipped to level one, Glasgow and Moray remain under tighter restrictions. It means bars and restaurants in those two areas will not be able to serve alcohol indoors and they will have to close their doors to indoor diners at 20:00. The latest figures show thatCovid infections are continuing to rise in Glasgow,with weekly case rates now at 100.3 per 100,000 people, with indications they may rise further. The number of weekly cases per 100,000 people is a key indicator for the Scottish government when judging what level of restrictions an area should be under. Moray's rate for the 14 May was 55.2, but that now appears to be falling. Donald Macleod, convenor of the Glasgow Licensing Forum, believes hospitality is being ""treated with contempt"". ""I am happy for those who can open but I feel desperately sad and sorry for all those in Glasgow on what should have been a happy Monday, which has become a very blue, dank, dreary Monday,"" he says. ""Cases go up but mortality rates don't, hospital admissions don't and yet we are locked down. There is no run on the NHS. We should not be shutting down an economy, a whole city.

Abi Morgan and Luke Hinojosa planned to marry last June, but were forced to postpone due to Covid restrictions. They got married earlier today at the White Hart Hotel in Lincolnafter rules were eased, allowing up to 30 people to attend a wedding ceremony. Abi said she felt a sense of relief as well as being delighted that they were finally able to tie the knot. ""It's [the pandemic] put our lives on hold,"" she said.

They said they were also looking forward to spending their wedding night away from home. Luke said: ""It's going to be strange because we haven't been able to stay anywhere for months, [but] we are looking forward to a good night away."" Around 4,500 supporters were admitted for Barnsley's play-off match against Swansea this evening There are big changes happening in spectator sport today asup to 10,000 fans will be allowedto return to Englandâs outdoor sports venues. The latest easing of Covid rules means home fans will able to watch the final two rounds of this seasonâs Premier League from the stands as stadiums reopen with reduced capacity. The final two rounds of matches will be played on 18-19 May and 23 May. Up to 2,000 fans were allowed at a number of Premier League matches in December, the last time fans were in attendance at top-flight games, before the country went back into lockdown. Fans also returned for Newcastle's rugby union match with Northampton Up to 10,000 fans or 25% capacity, whichever figure is lower, will be allowed at larger outdoor venues, while at smaller outdoor venues, the limit will be capped at 4,000 or 50% capacity.

Roxy and her friend Amy making the most of the change in guidance on physical contact Hugs are back for people in
England and Scotland from today. One person whoâs missed them
greatly is Roxy Deniz Ozalp from London. She helps to run Morning Gloryville â
an organisation that hosts morning dance raves for people to have fun,
socialise and exercise. âAt Morning Gloryville hugs are
so important,â she says. âWe hug for at least 20 seconds which releases
happiness hormones in our body. We feel this burst of joy. Itâs so precious. âDuring the pandemic, a lot of
people have been alone for long periods of time. Many couldnât visit family and
even had to say goodbye to loved ones who passed away."" Earlier, she met some friends outdoors for some hugs. âNow weâre coming through
such extraordinary times, we are celebrating that with hugs. How
symbolic is that?â Much has changed across the UK today with the easing of restrictions bringing a further step towards a return to normality.

They got married earlier today at the White Hart Hotel in Lincolnafter rules were eased, allowing up to 30 people to attend a wedding ceremony. Abi said she felt a sense of relief as well as being delighted that they were finally able to tie the knot. ""It's [the pandemic] put our lives on hold,"" she said. Luke said: ""Everything pretty much stopped, waiting for the day to finally be here, but we feel like we can carry on with life now as husband and wife,"" ""I have a wife now,"" he added. They said they were also looking forward to spending their wedding night away from home. Luke said: ""It's going to be strange because we haven't been able to stay anywhere for months, [but] we are looking forward to a good night away."" Around 4,500 supporters were admitted for Barnsley's play-off match against Swansea this evening There are big changes happening in spectator sport today asup to 10,000 fans will be allowedto return to Englandâs outdoor sports venues. The latest easing of Covid rules means home fans will able to watch the final two rounds of this seasonâs Premier League from the stands as stadiums reopen with reduced capacity. The final two rounds of matches will be played on 18-19 May and 23 May. Up to 2,000 fans were allowed at a number of Premier League matches in December, the last time fans were in attendance at top-flight games, before the country went back into lockdown. Fans also returned for Newcastle's rugby union match with Northampton Up to 10,000 fans or 25% capacity, whichever figure is lower, will be allowed at larger outdoor venues, while at smaller outdoor venues, the limit will be capped at 4,000 or 50% capacity. At indoor venues, the cap will be 1,000 or 50%, whichever is lowest. Fans returned for todayâs rugby union fixtures between Newcastle Falcons and Northampton Saints as well as Bristol v Gloucester; while spectators will be allowed back into cricket grounds for the round of County Championship matches that begins on 19 and 20 May. Roxy and her friend Amy making the most of the change in guidance on physical contact Hugs are back for people in
England and Scotland from today. One person whoâs missed them
greatly is Roxy Deniz Ozalp from London. She helps to run Morning Gloryville â
an organisation that hosts morning dance raves for people to have fun,
socialise and exercise. âAt Morning Gloryville hugs are
so important,â she says. âWe hug for at least 20 seconds which releases
happiness hormones in our body. We feel this burst of joy. Itâs so precious. âDuring the pandemic, a lot of
people have been alone for long periods of time. Many couldnât visit family and
even had to say goodbye to loved ones who passed away."" Earlier, she met some friends outdoors for some hugs. âNow weâre coming through
such extraordinary times, we are celebrating that with hugs. How
symbolic is that?â Much has changed across the UK today with the easing of restrictions bringing a further step towards a return to normality. Here's a round-up of what you can do now, and how to do it safely: As holidays to Portugal resumed today, our Business Reporter Simon Browning joined excited - and relieved - passengers on a flight to Faro.

"This video can not be played Holidaying Brits touch down in Portugal: 'It feels unreal' Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel. Travellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery. Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return. The bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning. The vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back. Bookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. However, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to ""green"" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were ""very busy"". He said the latest relaxation of restrictions was ""a small step in the right direction"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there weredefinite signs of an early reboundin travel to European destinations. Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. ""The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We are very optimistic for the next couple of months."" Nellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport. They are ""super excited and really happy to be able to travel again"". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel. Nellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. ""Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,"" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added. Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a ""big relief"". He expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times. ""It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,"" he added. But there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was ""still small"". It said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds. Live: Indoor pints and trips abroad as lockdown eases What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? The rules for holidays in green list countries such as Portugal Public must play their part as lockdown eases - PM People in Wales asked not to travel abroad On Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours. That led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use. Passengers checking in at Gatwick Many of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury. Hays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a ""cautious optimism"" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer. Chief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by Â£370 to Â£4,000 as people look to ""fulfil their bucket list"". ""People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,"" he said. After months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. The paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. Still at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. Passengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. While travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter. And the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers. EasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against ""all but essential"" travel. The majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. Travellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under theTest to Release scheme,external. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end. Masked sunbathers in Portugal BA boss Sean Doyle said ""cautious optimism"" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. He said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were ""trending positively"", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business ""now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling"". From Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.

"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. ""We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm... It will take time,"" Mr Netanyahu warned. Gaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes. Ten people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Meanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Rockets launched by Hamas have hit Ashkelon, southern Israel Sunday was thedeadliest day so far The Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. Hamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. Millions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go. Riyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died. ""I ran to check upon the girls,"" said Mr Eshkuntana. ""My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble."" The Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said. Suzy, six, was rescued from rubble in Gaza City on Sunday, but five members of her family died Israel's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas. It said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. It was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. Gazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes. The Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. What is Hamas? How Israel's Iron Dome missile shield works Boris Johnson condemns 'shameful' anti-Semitism in video In Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. The country's Iron Dome defence systemhas intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. Israelis clean up a rocket-damaged synagogue in Ashkelon A car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. The threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. Those tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. By Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Is Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Guardian of the Walls"", nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with ""full force"" and will ""take time"". In a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were ""pressures"" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet. What happenedduringthe UN meeting? The 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. The United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process. In Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support ""should the parties seek a ceasefire"" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict. Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. ""Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,"" he said, ""but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots."" In response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called ""a heroic effort"" to ""dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties"". Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"This video can not be played Holidaying Brits touch down in Portugal: 'It feels unreal' Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel. Travellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery. Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return. The bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning. The vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back. Bookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. However, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to ""green"" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were ""very busy"". He said the latest relaxation of restrictions was ""a small step in the right direction"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there weredefinite signs of an early reboundin travel to European destinations. Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. ""The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We are very optimistic for the next couple of months."" Nellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport. They are ""super excited and really happy to be able to travel again"". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel. Nellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. ""Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,"" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added. Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a ""big relief"". He expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times. ""It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,"" he added. But there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was ""still small"". It said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds.

The rules for holidays in green list countries such as Portugal Public must play their part as lockdown eases - PM People in Wales asked not to travel abroad On Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours. That led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use. Passengers checking in at Gatwick Many of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury. Hays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a ""cautious optimism"" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer. Chief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by Â£370 to Â£4,000 as people look to ""fulfil their bucket list"". ""People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,"" he said. After months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. The paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. Still at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. Passengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. While travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter. And the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers. EasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against ""all but essential"" travel. The majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. Travellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under theTest to Release scheme,external. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end. Masked sunbathers in Portugal BA boss Sean Doyle said ""cautious optimism"" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. He said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were ""trending positively"", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business ""now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling"". From Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.
