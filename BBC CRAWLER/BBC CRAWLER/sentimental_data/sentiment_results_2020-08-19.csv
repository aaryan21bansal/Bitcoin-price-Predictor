"A boat with about 17 people on board was spotted off the coast of Dover by the BBC A Welsh Conservative MP has been criticised by immigration law specialists following comments she made on social media about migrants crossing the English Channel. Wrexham MP Sarah Atherton said the armed forces should be deployed to end the ""unacceptable"" boat crossings. However her statement has been described as ""misleading"" and displaying ""staggering"" ignorance. Ms Atherton said she respected others who did not share her opinion. The number of people seeking to enter the UK by crossing the Channel has recently increased, reigniting a debate over how to address the situation. There was a new record of at least 235 arrivals on 6 August, according to Home Office figures. In her Twitter post, Ms Atherton wrote: ""What we are seeing on a huge scale with the boats crossing the Channel is precisely that, flagrant violations of our immigration law by economic migrants and human-trafficking gangs."" Ms Atherton's comments were described as ""heartless"" and ""ignorant"" by some on twitter Ms Atherton, who was elected to parliament for the first timelast December, said: ""UK Border Forces should receive whatever assistance is required from HM Armed Forces in this endeavour. ""It is time for tough words to be matched with tough actions so that fairness may be restored to our immigration system, and the constituents of Wrexham may feel secure in the knowledge that this a government which finally takes concerns about immigration seriously."" Ms Atherton also claimed the situation was more difficult to deal with due to a ""legal framework owing to our previous membership of the EU"". ""This framework places undue power in the hands of unaccountable human rights lawyers who do not have our country's best interests at heart,"" she said. How will the UK points-based immigration system work? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? In response, Dan Sohege, director of the human rights advocacy group Stand for All, accused Ms Atherton of ""playing politics with peoples' lives"" and displaying a ""staggering level of ignorance"". ""Not only is her letter full of inaccuracies, but her very suggestions would lead the UK to violate the fundamental principles of human rights law and open the UK up to international legal action at a time when it is trying to demonstrate that it can be part of the wider international community without being an EU member state.""

Colin Yeo, a barrister specialising in immigration law, said there needed to be ""some serious thought into how to prevent people risking their lives in this way"". ""Misleading contributions like this which are simply wrong in legal terms are counterproductive,"" he added. A community football team in Wrexham, Bellevue FC, also criticised the comments. The club - which aims to bring migrants, refugees and asylum seekers together - said Ms Atherton's views ""did not speak"" for Wrexham. Responding to the criticism, Ms Atherton told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service: ""I appreciate this is an emotive issues and not all of us will share the same opinion, which is respected. ""As a constituency MP I frequently assist people in Wrexham seeking asylum. ""However what we are seeing in the Channel is little more than exploitation of vulnerable people by human traffickers and gang leaders. ""Nine months ago, the people of Wrexham voted decisively in favour of the Conservative immigration policy and putting an end to the UK open-door system. ""What is now being introduced is a sensible Australian-style points-based immigration system, ensuring people who are legitimate asylum seekers, fleeing persecution, can come here safely to live and work. ""What we are seeing is an abuse of the system, which is blocking the way for those in genuine need of asylum. She added that the UK ""will support those who are in genuine need"".

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two Islamic State suspects will not face the death penalty if convicted of the killings of Western hostages in Iraq and Syria, the US has told the UK. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh are accused of being the last two members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their UK accents. The US sought the UK's help in the case but a legal fight over the use of the death penalty has stymied co-operation. The US has now made clear the two will not be executed if found guilty. In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, US Attorney General William Barr said the US authorities would not seek the death penalty against the two men and ""if imposed, it will not be carried out"". In the light of the assurances, he said he hoped the UK would share ""important evidence"" about the men promptly. ""If we receive the requested evidence and attendant cooperation from the UK, we intend to proceed with a United States prosecution,"" he wrote. ""Indeed, it is these unique circumstances that have led me to provide the assurance offered in this letter."" What is behind Britain's IS duo decision? Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? A Home Office spokesman said the UK ""continue to work closely with international partners to ensure that those who have committed crimes in the name of Daesh are brought to justice"". The pair, who are in US military custody in Iraq, were British citizens, but have been stripped of their UK nationality. They are alleged to have been members of an IS kidnap gang behind the killings of a number of Western hostages, including American journalists and British aid workers, in Iraq and Syria in 2014. The victims were beheaded and their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The UK believes the men cannot be legally extradited to the US, but in 2018 it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them. In response, ministers said they would share intelligence, without opposing a death penalty sentence. But co-operation with the US was halted after the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh launched a legal challenge, arguing the UK's position was in breach of its internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. Several relatives of the murdered western hostages have said they want the men to face a fair trial, rather than the death penalty. Diane Foley, whose son James, an American journalist, was murdered by the cell in 2014, said: ""I am very hopeful that with this assurance that the death penalty will be waived, that will allow the United Kingdom and United States to pool their evidence so that true justice might be served."" ""I feel that the death penalty is too easy. It allows them to be martyrs... I really feel if they truly have done these horrible crimes, they really need to face life imprisonment, so they have a chance for redemption themselves and a chance to really recognise the horror of what they've done to others,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. The Supreme Court has ruled that the US government's demand to use crucial evidence from the UK in the case was unlawful. At the time, the UK said it was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"". However, the UK has made clear that if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the US was warning that if the issue was not settled by the middle of October, the two men would be handed over to the Iraqi government. IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. The liberation of that territory control exposed the magnitude of the abuses inflicted on their inhabitants, including summary killings, torture, amputations, ethno-sectarian attacks, rape and sexual slavery imposed on women and girls. Hundreds of mass graves containing the remains of thousands of people have also been discovered. UN investigators have said IS militants committed acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

"Stephen Price was jailed for three years for sexual offences after stealing the identity of another man A man who had his identity stolen by a sex offender to groom young girls was wrongly held in custody over Christmas. The unnamed father's details were stolen from a dating site by Stephen Price, 53, from Barry, and used to send explicit images to a 14-year-old girl. However the ""girl"" was actually a group of paedophile hunters, who visited the innocent man's house and accused him of being a paedophile. Price admitted four child sex offence charges at Cardiff Crown Court. He was jailed for three years and made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. Prosecutor Christopher Rees said: ""The man whose picture Price was using was visited at his home by four large men just before Christmas. ""They accused him in front of his elderly mother of being a paedophile,"" he told the court. The man was arrested and was locked up over Christmas, before being released on bail and his name was not cleared until Price's arrest in February. Price admitted attempting sexual communication with a child, attempting to cause a child to watch sexual activity, attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child and attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. Defending, Clare Wilks said: ""Mr Price accepts creating a fake profile and chose the picture of a younger and more attractive man. ""He had no idea that man would be tracked in the way he was."" Judge Nicola Jones said: ""The situation has caused untold damage to the man. ""There has been a considerable deterioration in his mental health. He was locally reviled and abused on social media. ""The paedophile hunters - if I can use that awful expression - realised they had made an enormous mistake. They had named and shamed a man who was entirely innocent.""

"Apple boss Tim Cook Tech giant Apple has become the first US company to be valued at $2tn (Â£1.5tn) on the stock market. It reached the milestone just two years after becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company in 2018. Its share price hit $467.77 in mid-morning trading in the US on Wednesday to push it over the $2tn mark. The only other company to reach the $2tn level was state-backed Saudi Aramco after it listed its shares last December. But the oil giant's value has slipped back to $1.8tn since then and Apple surpassed it to become the world's most valuable traded company at the end of July. The iPhone-maker's shares have leapt more than 50% this year, despite the coronavirus crisis forcing it to shut retail stores and political pressure over its links to China. In fact, its share price has doubled since its low point in March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the markets. Tech firms, which have been viewed as winners despite lockdowns, have seen their stock surge in recent weeks, even though the US is in recession. Apple posted strong third quarter figures towards the end of July, including $59.7bn of revenue and double-digit growth in its products and services segments. The next most valuable US company is Amazon which is worth around $1.7tn. US stocks hit new high after coronavirus crash Apple helped make 'top secret' government iPod Apple's rapid share price rise is ""an impressive feat within a short period of time"", said Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight. ""The last few months have underlined the importance of users and households alike to own better quality devices, connections and services and with Apple's strong broad portfolio of devices and a growing services offering, there are plentiful opportunities for future growth."" He said the arrival of gigabit connectivity broadband would offer Apple ""endless possibilities"". ""All eyes are now on the eagerly anticipated 5G iPhone which will fuel further consumer demand,"" he added. Microsoft and Amazon follow Apple as the most valuable publicly traded US companies, each at about $1.6tn. They are followed by Google-owner Alphabet at just over $1tn.

"The number of children crossing the Channel in dinghies has risen Update 4th September 2020: French authoritieshave since saidthat they believe the victim was 28 years old. A 16-year-old from Sudan who disappeared at sea has been found dead on a French beach. French politicians believe the boy, whose body was found in Calais, went missing while attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat. A search operation began after another migrant was found with hypothermia on the shore at about 02:00 BST. He told authorities that his friend, who could not swim, was missing after their makeshift boat capsized. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said the death of the young migrant was a ""brutal reminder"" that people smugglers exploit the vulnerable. Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said that the government was wrong to focus only on the criminals organising crossings, adding that reports the boy had pushed off in a makeshift boat made it ""likely that people smugglers weren't even involved"". She called on the Home Secretary to instead ""turn her attention immediately to creating safe and legal routes so that no on else suffers the same fate"". Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said the government's response to the rise in crossings had been ""lacking in compassion and competence"". He urged ministers to ""step up work with international partners to find a humanitarian solution to this crisis, which is costing lives"". Border Force and the RNLI are thought to have picked up several groups from dinghies on Wednesday The Home Office would not confirm whether the boy had been trying to reach the UK. Asked to clarify if there was evidence people smugglers were involved in the death, it said it would not comment on an investigation that is being lead by the prosecutors' office in Boulogne-sur-Mer. A further 41 people on four boats were rescued by French authorities after getting into difficulty on Wednesday. One had fallen overboard and was pulled from sea at about 07:30. More than 4,800 people have reached the UK after crossing the Channel in about 360 small boats this year. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The death of a 16-year-old child in the Channel is a tragedy. My thoughts are with his loved ones. ""This is a humanitarian crisis that needs a compassionate response."" The Bishop of Dover, Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, said: ""People who try to cross the Channel seeking safety and security are not criminals - they are human beings, like you and I. ""Human beings who should be afforded the dignity and respect and rights that so many of us take for granted. ""It is a travesty that this young man will never see his hoped-for future, that his family has been deprived of seeing him grow up."" Clare Moseley, of refugee charity Care4Calais, said she was ""absolutely devastated by the unnecessary death of this child"". ""We can only imagine the fear he felt and our hearts go out to his family,"" she said. Ms Moseley said the boys the charity supports in Calais were ""fun to be with despite the horrors they have been through"". ""Some are cheeky, some are smart, some like football, some like books. None deserve to be here and none deserve to die alone in the sea."" Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Home Office seeks navy help over migrant crossings Council has 'no capacity for more child migrants' Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: ""It should not be the case that people feel they have no choice but to make such dangerous journeys in their search for protection. ""At a time when more than 1% of the world's population has been displaced, we need countries to work together to provide the best humanitarian outcome."" French minister Marlene Schiappa said the boy's body was found on a beach in Sangatte, Calais, on Wednesday. Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont said it ""seems pretty sure he drowned in the Channel"". Earlier this month, Dan O'Mahoney was appointed as the UK's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander in a bid to make the Channel route ""unviable"" for small boat crossings. But Mr Dumont said ""whatever the British government implement in the Channel, people will try to cross"". ""The more difficult it will be to cross, the more dangerous it will be,"" he added. He said the ""only solution"" was to allow migrants living in Europe to claim asylum in the UK, without having to land in Britain. Immigration minister Chris Philp said the ""awful tragedy near Calais shows how dangerous this migration route is"". ""We will redouble our work to agree and implement a new plan with France with the aim of completely stopping these boat crossings, which are facilitated by ruthless criminals and which risk lives.""

"This video can not be played ""I felt unsafe walking down the street,"" says former Cardiff University student A former Cardiff University student is seeking legal advice on how it dealt with a racism complaint. Natasha Chilambo, 25, was one of eight black students to complain when a fellow student wore blackface as ""a stereotypical, hyper-sexualised black man"" in a 2016 play. She felt ""isolated"" and ""paranoid"", one student attempted suicide and another could not attend lectures. The university apologised for the ""pain and upset"" caused. It added ithad held an independent inquiry. Natasha, from Swindon, said she suffered from insomnia and stopped eating in the aftermath of the incident, and eventually had to leave the university and complete her training in London. She was one of eight black medical students in their third year at Cardiff Medical School when the annual Anaphylaxis charity play took place in 2016. Natasha Chilambo has crowdfunded nearly Â£6,000 for legal funds That year, one of the students who took part in the play impersonated the only black lecturer at the university's medical school, by performing blackface and wearing a black sex toy around his waist. The play also included other racist, sexist and homophobic jokes. This led to the eight black medical students in Natasha's year making a confidential complaint to the university in February as a group. They also asked for a public apology. The 31 medical students who took part in the play were immediately suspended from clinical placements after breaching the university's student behaviour expectations, but they were later permitted to return. BBC Wales has spoken to three of the students who complained, who felt the university did not deal with the complaint or support them adequately. One of the three, who has asked to remain anonymous, said the fact eight black students had made a complaint was made public by the university - effectively removing their anonymity in the process. She said: ""People did the maths. Out of 300 medical students in the year only eight were black. People essentially started to hate us. ""I'd stopped going to lectures because I couldn't face meeting or being in a room with so many other people who I knew didn't appreciate [me] or were angered [by me] at standing up for what was right."" She added: ""The university could have done so much more to protect us."" Cardiff University said the letter had originally been shared so those involved could see the full allegations being raised. The university arranged for the students in the play to write letters of apology, but the complainants said these were only available to view at a certain time and place under condition they would not disclose the contents. Cardiff University said there was an ""open invitation"" to read the letters, and that they formed one part of a restorative justice process, which offered support to those who had complained, and engaged everyone involved to ""try and help repair relationships"". A spokesperson for Cardiff University said a ""wide range of support"" was provided which included ""supporting members of the complainant group to move house, change clinical placement locations, access counselling and support"". The university said it recognised it had failed to foresee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students They added: ""What the university does recognise is that it failed to foresee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students and that we were unable to influence or intervene in a manner that was able to prevent the very deep hurt caused by the breakdown in friendships and peer group relationships that we know impacted so heavily on some members of the complainant group."" The three complainants said the way the complaint was dealt with led to a decline in their mental health. Natasha said: ""I couldn't walk down the streets in Cardiff without feeling unsafe, without panicking about who am I going to meet, are they going to be the students in that play? ""I couldn't do that any longer and ended up having to leave the medical school."" She moved to Kings College London to complete her studies. But when Cardiff University tweeted about the death of George Floyd earlier this year stating ""racism and discrimination have no place in our modern society"" it brought it all back. Natasha said: ""I remember thinking, how can you make such a bold declaration around this space when students who are there now and have been in the past have told you for years that they face racism?"" It prompted her to consider legal action over the way her complaint was dealt with in 2016. She has raised nearly Â£6,000 on GoFundMe for legal fees. Natasha said moving on would be the easier option, but that she wants to make things better for black students in the future. She said: ""We have to create a culture where people are held accountable for their actions that are harmful, where there is the space to say 'you caused me harm'. ""We have to create a culture that empowers, encourages and supports people when they say these things are wrong, or otherwise they carry on and that's not good enough."" The university said it conducted an Independent Review Panel to examine how it's responding to institutional and cultural barriers that exist for minority ethnic students and staff. It said the School of Medicine is working with student societies the African Caribbean Medical Association, Cardiff Healthcare International Perspectives and MedSoc to develop a Student Staff Race Equality Task Group. Yemi Sawyerr said she didn't think black students were supported enough But some black students at Cardiff University still say they feel unsupported by the institution, four years after the play. Yemi Sawyerr, from London, has finished her second year at Cardiff Medical School. Yemi, 20, said: ""Given that the university is predominantly white, I don't think that black students are supported enough."" She said in equality and diversity training she was told to explain why racism is wrong if a patient was racist to her. Yemi said: ""I think the onus is on us to deal with it and fight, rather than on the uni."" Earlier this yearstudents at Cardiff School of Dentistry complained to the university of ""racist behaviour and unconscious bias""from some teaching staff, fellow students and patients. The authors claimed black and ethnic minority students have been mocked and subjected to racist language. The university said it had ""learnt many lessons"" following the incident and complaint The university said it accepted there were failings in the handling of the 2016 Anaphylaxis play, and it had ""learnt many lessons"" and had taken action to address issues such as creating a central incident group to ensure a ""consistent approach to complaints of racism"". A spokesman said: ""The vice-chancellor took the unprecedented step of commissioning an independent and expert panel to review issues of racism in the institution. The panel was given complete access to all available information and was supported to interview staff and students. ""The independent report was published and made a series of recommendations which were accepted in full and their implementation was led by a dedicated member of staff reporting to the deputy vice-chancellor. ""The issues of racism raised by the event are taken extremely seriously and at the most senior level of the organisation as we continue to work to ensure a cultural transformation across the university.""

"Durham University vowed to provide more information about its offer in the coming days A university is offering financial incentives to students in a bid to persuade them to defer their studies following the U-turn over A-level results. Durham University has promised a bursary and guarantee of accommodation for everyone who defers until 2021. It said it had ""capacity issues"" due to the ""unprecedented situation"". Exam grades for students across the UK have been revised following a backlash over grading systems. Durham University said ""it is possible some offer holders"" will have to enrol in 2021 rather than next month as it struggles to provide enough places. In an attempt to ""minimise"" the number of people affected, it said it would ""seek volunteers"" and offer the incentives ""to help with their transition to university life"" next year. It has not confirmed how much the bursaries would be worth. With students not able to sit exams due to the coronavirus pandemic, ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales decided on Monday to revert to teacher-assessed grades rather than those decided by an algorithm. Scotland had reverted to teacher-assessed grades on 4 August after a similar outcry. That led to a rush for university places as students tried to reclaim spots after being rejected just days before. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has accused the government of failing students and universities. It said A-level results ""should never have been released before being subject to scrutiny beyond Ofqual"" and that ministers ""should not have had to rely on shocked 18-year-olds on results day to realise there was a problem"". The government isplanning to remove caps on student numbersand said it will work closely with universities on the challenges they are facing.

"Dachshunds would be among those benefiting from the legislation Taking your dog for walks twice a day for at least an hour in total could soon become the law in Germany. There could also be a ban on keeping dogs chained for long periods. Rules are also being devised to crack down on ""puppy farms"" by banning breeders from looking after more than three litters at any one time. ""Pets are not cuddly toys, their needs have to be taken into account,"" Agriculture Minister Julia KlÃ¶ckner said about the planned changes. Under the planned rules, dog owners: will have to take their dogs for walks twice a day for a minimum of one hour in total will not be allowed to keep their dogs chained for long periods of time will not be allowed to leave dogs alone the whole day Breeders will be restricted to looking after a maximum of three litters and puppies will have to spend a minimum of four hours a day in human company to ensure they get socialised. Why the French are 'champions' at abandoning pets The animals abandoned in lockdown Ms KlÃ¶ckner said the changes were based on expert advice to ensure animal protection and welfare. The rules are meant to ensure animal welfare A draft of the new regulations has already been drawn up and could become law early next year. If passed, it will be up to the German states to enforce it. A spokeswoman for the agriculture ministry said it was very unlikely private dog owners would receive police visits to check whether they had taken their pooch for a walk. She said the emphasis would be on ensuring that dogs kept in kennels were treated well. A ban is also planned on showing dogs which have had their ears or tail docked in contravention of animal protection rules. Dogs whose behaviour is not ""species appropriate"" could also be banned from dog shows. Ms KlÃ¶ckner's plans also include new rules on transporting cattle with time spent in transit limited to four-and-a-half hours.

"Migrants on a boat off the Libyan coast (file image) At least 45 migrants and refugees, including five children, have died in the deadliest shipwreck off Libya this year, the UN refugee agency says. They were among more than 80 people on board a vessel whose engine exploded off the coast of Zwara, the UNHCR said. The deaths were reported by some 37 survivors rescued by local fishermen. Boththe UNHCR and International Organization for Migration (IOM) have called for search and rescue efforts for migrants to be stepped up.,external They said that without a dedicated search and rescue operation mechanism, more lives would be lost in the Mediterranean. World of migrants turned upside down by Covid-19 Migrant's death exposes UN failures in Libya More than 300 people are known to have died trying to cross the sea from Libya to Europe this year, with the actual figure believed to be much higher. Since the 2011 overthrow and killing of its former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a key transit country for migrants. But conditions for migrants there are dangerous, with the UNHCR and the IOM warning they were ""at risk of the ongoing conflict, severe human rights violations, and arbitrary detention post-disembarkation"". The survivors of Wednesday's shipwreck, who were mainly from Senegal, Mali, Chad and Ghana, were detained after they disembarked in Libya. There are reports of migrants being treated appallingly in Libya, especially if they fall into the hands of militiamen and traffickers, who abuse them and try to extort money from them.

"Some of the lines appear to be abstract in nature, but some may represent faces and even animals Fragments of stone engraved with abstract designs are the earliest known art in the British Isles, researchers say. They were made by hunter-gatherers who lived between 23,000 and 14,000 years ago on what is now Jersey. The designs were scratched into small ornamental tablets known as plaquettes; similar examples have been found in France, Spain and Portugal. The 10 plaquettes were unearthed at Les Varines, Jersey, between 2014 and 2018. Since the discoveries in the south-east of the island, scientists from London's Natural History Museum, the University of Newcastle and University of York have been analysing the prehistoric markings. The researchers,who have published their findings in the journal Plos One,external, now believe they represent the earliest evidence of artistic expression in the British Isles. The plaquettes were made by the Magdalenians, a hunter-gatherer culture thought to have expanded out of Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) and southern France after the peak of the last Ice Age. The designs consist of straight lines more or less in parallel and longer, curved incisions. The two types of mark were probably produced by the same tools, in short succession - perhaps by the same engraver. Painted caves challenge art origins 'Oldest animal painting' discovered Neanderthals were capable of making art Some possible interpretations of engravings on one of the plaquettes Co-author Dr Silvia Bello, from the Natural History Museum, said: ""Many of the lines, including the curved, concentric designs, appear to have been made through layered or repeated incisions, suggesting that it is unlikely that they resulted from the stones being used for a functional purpose. She told BBC News that most were ""of abstract nature (simple intersecting lines), however, some fragments seem to depict zoomorphic representations (horses, mammoths, a bovid and possibly a human face)"". ""On all the fragments, these potential representations appear imprecise and simplified in comparisons to other Magdalenian examples, supporting either the hypothesis these are chance arrangements amongst a system of representations, or that they were the product of inexperienced engravers,"" she explained. The Magdalenian era saw a flourishing of early art, from cave paintings and drawings to the decoration of tools and weapons to  engraving on stones and bones. The team excavate Magdalenian hearths - or camp fires - at Les Varines in Jersey Although Magdalenian settlements are known to have existed as far north-west as Britain, no similar examples of artistic expression had previously been discovered in the British Isles from such an early time period. The plaquettes appear to pre-date the late Magdalenian cave art at Creswell Crags in Derbyshire, the researchers said. Dr Chantal Conneller, a co-author from Newcastle University, said: ""These engraved stone fragments provide exciting and rare evidence of artistic expression at what was the farthest edge of the Magdalenian world. ""The people at Les Varines are likely to have been pioneer colonisers of the region and creating engraved objects at new settlements may have been a way of creating symbolic relationships with new places."" Dr Bello said the artefacts may only have been of temporary significance, as they were made on soft stone. ""The action of engraving probably created a powder within the incisions that makes them temporarily visible. This swiftly disperses, meaning that the engravings were only clearly visible at the moment of their making. She added: ""The act of engraving, possibly the context and the moment when the engraving occurred, were the meaningful components of the process rather than the object (the plaquette) that had been engraved."" A more permanent form of artistic expression is found in the spectacular cave paintings created by Magdalenian people at Lascaux in southern France and Altamira in northern Spain. The excavation site at Les Varines on Jersey is located just north of St Helier, at the head of a dry valley that drops towards the sea. A cave painting created by Magdalenian artists at Altamira, northern Spain Dr Ed Blinkhorn, a co-author from University College London (UCL), said: ""The plaquettes were tricky to pick apart from the natural geology at the site - every stone needed turning. Their discovery amongst hearths, pits, paving, specialist tools, and thousands of flints shows that creating art was an important part of the Magdalenian pioneer toolkit, as much at camp as within caves."" Three of the stone fragments from Jersey had been recovered from an area of granite slabs which may have served as paving, highlighting that the plaquettes might have been engraved in a domestic context. Dr Bello said it is possible that the Magdalenian people at Les Varines may have used a pigment called ochre to decorate some plaquettes. ""One plaquette (LVE 4700), is not engraved, but presents a large stain (about 45x23mm) on its flat surface of a reddish colour. ""Microscopically, the stained surface area appears smooth, coated by some substance probably liquid in its original form which dried out. This area also has an elemental composition slightly richer in iron."" Though there is no unequivocal evidence, she said: ""It is possible that drops from an ochre-rich liquid substance may have fallen on this stone during application on another plaquette.""

"Security forces were posted outside factories and plants on Wednesday Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stepped up efforts to reassert his control after 10 days of street protests and strikes triggered by disputed elections. The official result gave him 80% of the vote but the opposition has denounced the poll as fraudulent. Mr Lukashenko says he has given orders to end the unrest in the capital Minsk. The move signalled an escalation just as EU leaders agreed to impose sanctions at a virtual summit. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made clear that the EU did not recognise the result of the election and called on Mr Lukashenko to release hundreds of protesters who have been imprisoned. What's happening in Belarus? 'The people will not forgive this' But on Wednesday, Mr Lukashenko approved a cabinet that would see Roman Golovchenko retain his role as prime minister, with many other key members of the previous government reappointed, the Tut.by news network reported. Among those on the list to remain in place was Interior Minister Yuri Karayev, whose responsibilities include policing and public security. The proposed government is subject to further consent by the lower house of parliament. The man who has led Belarus since 1994 said he had ordered police to quell protests in Minsk. ""There should no longer be any disorder in Minsk of any kind,"" he told his security council. ""People are tired. People demand peace and quiet,"" he added. He said he had ordered border controls to be tightened to prevent an influx of ""fighters and arms"". He also warned that workers at state media who had gone on strike in protest at the election and the subsequent crackdown on protests that they would not get their jobs back. Russian replacements have reportedly been brought in. Mr Lukashenko also accused those picketing outside factories of harassing workers. He had earlier accused the opposition of ""an attempt to seize power"". Actors of the Kuplovsky theatre were among those who came out on strike The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Minsk said there had already been some signs this morning of a change in tactics from the Belarusian authorities in Minsk. Our correspondent said that a checkpoint had appeared on the road leading to the state TV building with police checking the identity of anyone walking to the building. Strikes at factories around Minsk have also been obstructed by police. Mr Lukashenko's remarks came shortly after the exiled leader of the opposition, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, had urged EU leaders to reject the election. In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change The 37-year-old, who left for Lithuania after being detained for hours following the vote, released a video statement on Wednesday. She said President Lukashenko had ""lost all legitimacy in the eyes of our nation and the world"" and urged the EU to back what she called the ""awakening of Belarus"". She said: ""People who went out to defend their vote in the streets of their cities all across Belarus were brutally beaten, imprisoned and tortured by the regime desperately clinging on to power. This is taking place right now in the middle of Europe."" Ms Tikhanovskaya has formed a ""co-ordination council"" with plans for ""new, fair and democratic presidential elections with international supervision"". After a three-hour video conference, EU Leaders agreed unanimously to take three actions over Belarus, BBC Europe Correspondent Gavin Lee reports: Firstly, to impose sanctions including asset freezes for an as yet undisclosed number of officials involved in alleged election-rigging, brutality and imprisonment of protesters. The exact sanctions are still being worked out Secondly, leaders agreed to a joint form of words making clear that the EU stands with the people on the streets, and does not recognise the result. But it does not go as far as stating they do not recognise President Lukashenko's authority, as some EU officials wanted Thirdly, leaders offered help in trying to mediate dialogue between the government and the opposition, to find a way for the president to stand down and peacefully transfer power. In addition, â¬53m (Â£48m; $63m) of financial support from the EU to Belarus is being re-assigned away from the state to non-governmental organisations, with some money assigned to help the victims of violence, as well setting up alternatives to government-backed media organisations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said election had been neither free nor fair. Mrs Merkel said the EU would lend its support to civil society in Belarus EU leaders, she added, condemned ""the brutal violence against demonstrators as well as the imprisonment and use of violence against thousands of Belarusians"" which followed in the wake of the disputed election. She and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed the need for a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition in Belarus. 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital on Sunday On Saturday, Mr Lukashenko had said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had promised to provide assistance in the event of any external military threat. But on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there was no need for Russia to help Belarus militarily or otherwise at present. Mrs Merkel said that ""we've made it clear that military intervention by Russia would make the situation far more complicated"".

"Some retailers have reported strong makeup sales Life in a face covering means eye expression needs to make a big impression, prompting a shift in makeup sales. Eye makeup has been taking a larger proportion of prestige cosmetics sales during and after lockdown, according to analysts NPD. With lips now often hidden behind a mask, makeup sales in that area are taking a lesser share of spending. The fashion industry has been affected by homeworking and video conferencing. Online retailer Asos recently saidsales of make-up and sportswearhad been particularly strong as people were stuck at home, it said. It also said people were making more ""deliberate purchases"" rather than ordering and returning several items at a time. This video can not be played Influencers have been sharing tips on keeping your make-up looking good while wearing a mask NPD studied sales data for ""prestige"" makeup bought by women, which includes products sold in non-supermarket High Street stores and department stores, as well as online. It found that mascara and eye shadow drove an increasing share of sales for eye makeup, up from 22% of makeup sales before lockdown to 25% post-lockdown. Eyebrow products have also taken a rising share in the market, having previously been static for some time. How masks and acne created new makeup trends In contrast, makeup for lips fell from 14% of the market pre-lockdown, to 12% afterwards. ""The popularity of eye makeup can be attributed to increased experimentation at home and wearing make-up whilst socialising with family and friends virtually or during conference calls with colleagues,"" said Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty It also followed social media-led trends encouraging people to experiment with makeup while people often need to wear face coverings in public. ""As consumers are required to wear face coverings in shops, on public transport and other public spaces, the lip segment has declined in share, driven largely by a decline in demand of lip colour as the lip area is no longer visible when wearing a mask,"" she said.

"The government has confirmed it will scrap more than 200 vocational qualifications, including BTecs. BTec qualifications are A-level equivalents, aimed at people interested in working in a particular industry, such as engineering, hospitality or childcare. A BTec, which stands for the Business and Technology Education Council, is a practical qualification. Courses are assessed through exams, regular coursework and projects, and sometimes placements. BTec Firsts are Level 2 qualifications, meaning they are equivalent to GCSEs. Students often take a mixture of the two. They can be helpful for people trying to get into further education colleges. BTec Nationals are Level 3 qualifications, so can be taken alongside or instead of A-levels. They are studied over one or two years. Research suggests,externalone in four students use them as a route into university, while others gain occupation-specific skills and go straight into employment. BTecs are graded on a scale: Starred Distinction/Distinction Star (D*) Distinction (D) Merit (M) Pass (P) Some BTecs are worth two or three A-levels. Students normally receive their results on the same days as A-level and GCSE students, but some receive them before this. There are approximately 280,000 students studying at least one Level 3 applied general qualification, according to the Sixth Form College Association. A further 200,000 are estimated to be doing BTec Firsts and other BTec qualifications. Health and social care and applied science are among the most popular BTecs. Other subjects include construction, electrical engineering and art and design. BTec Nationals can be sat by any age group. In fact,most are taken by those over the age of 22,externalas they develop practical career skills. They are particularly popular among white working class students, according toresearch by the Social Market Foundation,externalthink tank. Other vocational courses are available in the UK, includingNational Vocational Qualifications,external(NVQs),TechBacs,external,Cambridge Technicals,externalandScottish Vocational Qualifications,external(SVQs). BTec results normally come out on the same days as A-level and GCSE results In 2020, there were more than 12,000 vocational qualifications at all levels, offered by more than 150 awarding bodies, according to Ofqual, which oversees qualifications in England. Plans by former Conservative governments to streamline post-16 education had meant many BTecs and other Level 3 courseswere due to lose their funding, to make way for the newT-levelsqualification. However, the Labour government paused and reviewed the plans, and has since announced that 157 qualifications will no longer be scrapped as planned. They include""key courses"" in ""important sectors"",external, the DfE said, such as agriculture, engineering, manufacturing and health and social care. Some have had funding confirmed until July 2026 and others until July 2027. The government also confirmed that more than 200 qualifications with ""with low or no enrolments"" would still have funding withdrawn from 1 August 2025. Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT, said the announcement provided ""much-needed clarity"" for schools and colleges. ""The ambition of the previous government for A-levels and T-levels to be the only two qualification pathways post-16 would have failed to meet the needs and ambitions of many students,"" she added.

"Four days have passed since BTec students across the UK were due to get their results. But those four days have been an anxious wait for many students - because they've heard nothing about their grades. Most received their qualification, according to the Association of Colleges, but exam board Pearson admits there has been a delay for some. With university spaces filling up - and clearing opportunities dying down - students worry they won't make it to university. Pearson didn't say when results will be available but is offering to speak to universities on behalf of affected students. The UK's largest awarding body for qualifications including BTecs, A-levels and GCSEs says it is looking into the issue ""urgently"".

OCR apologised for ""adding to the stress"" of students and said it would confirm results ""as soon as possible"". ""I love caring for people so much"" That's no help to 18-year-old Ellie Clarke though. She's spent the past two years completing her BTec in Health and Social Care - which included coursework, exams and 100 hours of voluntary work caring in the community. Her ""heart sank"" when she went to see what grade her hard work had led to and the website showed nothing. ""As students, we're committed to completing our assignments on time, but our exam board couldn't even commit to getting our results in on time."" She's since struggled to sleep and feels helpless. ""I've cried a few times. I don't know what to do or who to contact because there's realistically nothing I can do."" Without her results, she says it's hard to access clearing. ""I have until next week to accept my accommodation, as the universities now need our results as a matter of urgency."" Ellie and her classmates ""feel forgotten"", she adds, like they're ""not important"". But she is committed to caring for people, regardless of how the delay over results ends up. ""If this year doesn't go to plan, I'll carry on, get a nursing degree one day and treat those people that lowered my grades or didn't give me my grades - to show them how hard I worked.""

"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Gavin Williamson says he is ""incredibly sorry for the distress"" caused to pupils after having to make a U-turn in how A-levels and GCSEs are graded. The education secretary refused to say if he will resign amid a fresh scramble to secure university places. ""My focus is making sure youngsters get the grades that they deserve,"" he said. Tens of thousands of students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice offers, prompting concerns about the number of available places. And uncertainty is continuing as admissions service Ucas and universities themselves have yet to be granted access to upgraded results. Exam results: Where did it go wrong and what happens next? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? The University of Oxford said it now had ""many more offer-holders meeting their grades than in a normal year"" and as a result faced ""significant capacity constraints both within our colleges and on our academic courses"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK which represents vice-chancellors, said that many more students now had the grades to get into their first-choice university. He said this will ""cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place"". The Association of School and College Leaders said it would write to Mr Williamson to request an immediate independent review into what it called the grading ""fiasco"". ""This degree of transparency is necessary at a time when public confidence has been badly shaken,"" general secretary Geoff Barton said. He called on No 10 and Ofqual to put in place a ""robust contingency plan"" for students sitting GCSEs and A-levels next summer in the event of further Covid-related disruption. Mr Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: ""I would like to start off by apologising - saying sorry to all those young people who've been affected by this. This is something none of us expected to see and none of us wanted to see."" Both Frances Ramos (left) and Zainab Ali were left unsure if they would get their first-choice university places, despite their grades being bumped up Frances Ramos, 18, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, said she was pleased to be given her predicted grades of ABB - up from the BCD she received last Thursday. But she said the U-turn ""does feel like it's a bit too late"" and added: ""I kind of wish the government had done this on Thursday."" She is now waiting to hear if her first choice, the University of Liverpool, will accept her to study this year. Zainab Ali, 18, from London, also thought the government should have acted sooner. ""I think it's a shame. After the damage is done, that's when they will take action and I find it quite frustrating,"" she said. The U-turn should now mean Zainab is able to attend Queen Mary University, London. Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn Mr Williamson said it had been the common view of the government, Ofqual, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland of different political parties that the system in place was more robust and ""significantly better"" than that in Scotland, afteran earlier U-turn there. But after the release of A-level results on Thursday he said it ""became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadn't got the grade they truly deserved"". The ""exact same challenge"" would have remained had there been a U-turn earlier, he said, and ""we would still be faced with the challenge of the fact of how do we expand the capacity within the university sector"". He refused to address questions about his future as education secretary during interviews on Tuesday morning and he declined to offer explicit support for Ofqual's chief regulator, Sally Collier, to stay in her job. Mr Williamson later told LBC: ""We ended up in a situation where Ofqual didn't deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place."" Mr Williamson would not say whether he had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Boris Johnson during interviews on Tuesday Labour's shadow higher education minister Emma Hardy told Breakfast it appeared Ofqual had been ""thrown under the bus"" by the government despite it working to ministers' instructions during the pandemic. Ofqual's algorithm downgraded around 40% of entries and came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. NI: Assembly recall over exam results to go ahead Wales: Exam board chief 'disappointed' by grades U-turn The government's U-turn means teachers' assessments will also be used for all GCSE results - except for any cases where the algorithm adjustment actually suggests a better grade. It is still unclear what the climbdown will mean for students taking vocational qualifications, including BTecs, with studentstelling BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat: ""We've been forgotten about."" Mr Williamson said he hoped they would also be subject to teacher-assessed grades, adding that the government was working with awarding authorities to ensure this happened. Pearson, which awards BTecs, said it was aware that some BTec students had experienced a delay in receiving grades but did not say how many were impacted. As part of the changes to grading, Mr Williamson has suspended a cap on student numbers for universities - effectively allowing institutions to accept unlimited numbers this year. 11 August:Gavin Williamson announced A-level students would be able to use their results in mock tests to appeal if they are unhappy with the grades they are given, calling it a ""safety net"". Earlier in the day Scotland's government decided to switch to teachers' predicted grades 12 August:Nick Gibb, schools minister for England, acknowledged the government was ""concerned"" about what had happened in Scotland but insisted the system in England remained ""robust"" Thursday 13 August (results day):Mr Williamson ruled out following the Scottish government in reversing position, telling Sky News: ""You've got to have a system that has checks and balances"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"" Saturday:Mr Williamson told the Times there would be ""no U-turn"" on the grading system, saying Scotland had ended up with ""a system where there aren't any controls"" and had ""rampant grade inflation"" Sunday:Mr Williamson defended Ofqual's grading method in the Sunday Express, saying the calculated grade ""makes certain that everyone can be confident that these qualifications carry the same weight as previous years"" Monday:Mr Williamson announces a move to teacher-assessed grades for A-levels and GCSES saying ""we now believe it is better"" Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group which represents 24 leading universities, said there were ""limits to what can be done by the university sector alone to address that uncertainty without stretching resources to the point that it undermines the experience for all"". VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Universities including Bristol, Durham, Sheffield and Liverpool stopped offering places through the clearing system that matches students to unfilled courses on Monday. Bristol later said it would accept all applicants who now met the terms of an offer and Sheffield said it would do so ""wherever possible"". But some universities say that numbers will have to remain limited on medicine and dentistry courses. Ucas was unable to say how many students had not been able to take up places due to their results being downgraded. It said its latest figures early on Tuesday showed: 327,350 university applicants had been placed at their first-choice university since the results were released last week, slightly up on the same point last year 45,300 candidates had accepted a place at a back-up choice university, and a further 25,190 candidates had found a place through clearing. This means that a maximum of around 60,000 students could have accepted offers at lower-choice universities due to the exam results chaos - although it is likely to be less than that as some would still have fallen short of the grades needed for their first choice A Ucas spokesman said students who have not got into their first-choice institution should seek advice from their parents or teachers before contacting the university. Sam Freedman, who was a senior policy adviser to the Department for Education between 2010 and 2013, said it ""beggared belief"" that the secretary of state had said he was only aware of problems over the weekend. ""I can't think of many other education secretaries who wouldn't have already resigned,"" he said.

"A man who rammed three motorcyclists on a motorway in Berlin is being investigated for what prosecutors say was ""an Islamist-motivated attack"". Three people were seriously injured when the suspect's car collided with motorbikes and cars on the A100 motorway shortly before 19:00 (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening. Witnesses said the 30-year-old Iraqi suspect claimed to have a ""dangerous object"" in a box of ammunition. Work tools were later found inside. Police and prosecutors say the series of crashes in three separate places on the A100 near the centre of Berlin were being considered as ""deliberate attacks on other road users"". Berlin prosecutor's office spokesman Martin Steltner told reporters the man was suspected of ""in effect hunting down motorcyclists"". The attack is being investigated as having either a political or religious motive but prosecutors have not ruled out psychological issues. ""Because of the circumstances we don't see this as a random accident,"" Mr Steltner said. ""Latest indications point to an Islamist-motivated attack."" At least six people were hurt, including three who were in a serious condition In the first incident, the suspect's black Opel car seriously injured a motorcyclist, then drove on targeting two more, eventually ramming the third motorcyclist into the path of his car. The third motorcyclist is reportedly in a life-threatening condition. Pictures of the car and the badly damaged motorbike in front of the bonnet gave an indication of the force of the attack on the motorcyclist, near a busy interchange on the A100 in the Tempelhof area of the German capital. After the crashes, the man was said to have placed a metal box on the road. According to sources quoted by the Tagesspiegel website, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""Nobody come closer or else you'll die."" Named by German media as Samrad A, the suspect lives in refugee accommodation and reports suggest he may have been radicalised there. He is expected to face three charges of attempted murder. Before the attack, the suspect posted pictures of his car on Facebook, along with religious phrases. Public broadcaster ARD reported that the suspect had received psychiatric treatment in the past after making threats to kill but he was not seen as closely linked to militant Islamists. Berlin Christmas market attacker shot dead in Milan The series of accidents on the A100 caused three hours of closures on the motorway on Tuesday, including on the central KurfÃ¼rstendamm. The centre of Berlin was targeted in December 2016, when Islamist militant Anis Amri drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and leaving 49 others injured. Amri fled to the northern Italian city of Milan, where he was shot dead by police. Amri, a Tunisian, had spent several years in jail in Italy.

"A total of 22 people were killed in the blast after an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017 Families of those who died in the Manchester Arena attack have given emotional statements to a court where the bomber's brother is awaiting sentencing. Over the course of a two-day sentencing hearing, relatives broke down in tears as they spoke about their grief and how ""life will never be the same"". Hashem Abedi,who was jailed for at least 55 years for the murder of 22 peoplein the 2017 terror attack, refused to leave his cell to hear them. Judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the Old Bailey the ""despair and desolation of the bereaved"" was ""palpable"", and praised the ""tremendous dignity and courage"" of those who attended. Chloe Rutherford was aged 17 when she died in the attack Lisa Rutherford from South Shields said her ""heart snapped"" when she received a phone call with the news her 17-year-old daughter Chloe Rutherford had died in the bombing. She said: ""We are lost, we are devastated and we feel an overwhelming loss. ""Somehow we are expected to get through life without her, without our baby girl, and it just feels impossible. There is always that empty chair where she should be."" ""As a family we need answers - we are destroyed,"" she told the court. Caroline Curry said her son Liam was a ""beautiful boy, inside and out"" Liam Curry, 19, also from South Shields, was Chloe's boyfriend and he too died in the blast. His mother Caroline Curry held up a photo of her son as the court heard her message to Abedi. ""You took from me something more precious than gold, a beautiful boy, inside and out. ""Life now is not a life, it's an existence I tolerate,"" she said. ""He would have been an amazing husband to Chloe and that has all been taken from me, from them, and the wider family."" John Atkinson was aged 28 when he was killed in the attack Daryl Price, father of John Atkinson, 28, said his grief ""consumes"" him and he ""simply cannot move on"". He said Abedi had shown a ""total disregard for human life"" and ""the repercussions of that night are beyond measure"". Mr Price added: ""I can't see a day when my pain will ever subside."" Georgina Callander, 18, had been ""so excited"" about going to the Ariana Grande concert Simon Callander, father of Georgina Callander, 18, said his ""beautiful little girl"" had been ""so excited"" about the Ariana Grande concert. He said out of goodness people talk to him about the incident but ""I don't want to talk. I want to die"". Figen Murray said the loss of her son Martyn Hett had left a ""massive void"" in their family Figen Murray told the court she is unable to go to sleep until after 22:31, the time the bomb went off and her son, Martyn Hett, was killed in the blast. She said: ""I still cannot reconcile that I was fast asleep while my son lay dead on the floor, and I am ashamed about that. ""The enormity of the loss has left a massive void. Martyn was at the top of his game."" Mr Hett's father Paul said the family would ""never get over"" his death. ""We are living in constant fear that something like this can happen again, that knock on the door,"" he said. Samantha Leczkowski tried to resuscitate her daughter Sorrell Samantha Leczkowski, from Leeds, lost her 14-year-old daughter Sorrell. Mrs Leczkowski tried to resuscitate Sorrell, despite being seriously injured herself. She said her daughter's ""senseless death"" has ""devastated us all"". ""Losing one of my children has killed me, I may as well be dead. ""I don't care that my leg doesn't work - the pain in my heart is the worst pain that won't go away. ""I had to see Sorrell die in my arms."" Eilidh Macleod's family said ""every day has been a struggle"" since she died in the explosion The parents of Eilidh Macleod, 14, who lived on the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, described her as a popular friend who was ""wise, well beyond her years"". They said: ""We still have to stop ourselves calling out her name for our dinner, that will never stop. ""Anger, fear, resentment and heartbreak is something we all have to live with. ""No parent who ever takes their child to a concert should ever have to take them home to bury them."" Kelly Brewster's sister said her mum had hoped to go shopping for a wedding dress with her daughter Survivor Claire Booth, who was injured in the attack, broke down in tears as she read her statement in memory of her sister Kelly Brewster, 32. ""Since 22 May 2017 our family has not been the same - all our hearts are broken,"" she said. ""My dad has not been able to walk his daughter down the aisle, my mum can't take her shopping for a wedding dress."" The partner of police officer Elaine McIver said losing her ""overshadows everything"" Paul Price was left in a coma after suffering ""dreadful"" injuries in the attack, and may yet require his leg to be amputated below the knee. His partner, police officer Elaine McIver, was killed in the blast. ""Elaine planned all of our social events and get-togethers, and now I find myself socially isolated without her,"" he said. ""The loss of Elaine overshadows everything and I don't think I will get over it."" Jane Tweddle was a school receptionist who lived in Blackpool Jane Tweddle's children said ""we know our mum will be with us forever"" and they hope to make her ""proud every day"". Daughter Harriet Taylor paid tribute to the 51-year-old school receptionist from Blackpool. She said in a statement: ""We simply will not let evil win. Evil is invisible, it has no face, no heart, no race. ""But what we have that evil never will have is love."" Megan Hurley was 15 when she was killed in the attack In a poignant tribute, the family of 15-year-old Megan Hurley chose not to make a statement, but simply asked to show the court an image of their daughter.

"The algorithm used to downgrade thousands of A-level results in England was ""unlawful"", Labour have claimed. The computer-based model used by Ofqual to standardise results after exams were cancelled breached anti-discrimination legislation as well as laws requiring it to uphold standards, Labour says. The party wants Gavin Williamson to publish the legal advice he was given. The education secretary has backed the regulator but apologised for the hurt caused to pupils by the chaos. Labour are calling for A-level pupils in England to be given a ""cast-iron guarantee"" they will not lose out on their first choice university place next month or in the future. Mr Williamson, who is facing calls from students and opposition MPs to resign, has urged universities to show flexibility after Monday's results U-turn threw September's admission process into further confusion. Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled How did Gavin Williamson survive exams U-turn? What's happening with university admissions? Hancock: Williamson has 'done his best' over exams Thousands of pupils remain uncertain about which university they will end up at after Ofqual said centre and school-assessed grades (CAG) would be accepted following a furore over its process for calculating them. The regulator has been severely criticised for using an algorithm to ""moderate"" the grades submitted by schools, giving substantial weight to schools' past performance as well as other factors. This resulted in nearly 40% of marks being downgraded, in some cases by more than one grade, with high-achieving pupils from schools in deprived areas being disproportionately affected. Labour said there had been ""no proper assessment"" of this year's cohort of pupils because the process used by Ofqual did ""not accurately reflect"" their level of knowledge, skill and understanding. As a result, their results could not be ""properly compared"" with those of previous years or other exam boards, meaning the regulator was in breach of its legal obligation to uphold assessment and qualification standards. In a letter to Mr Williamson and Ofqual's chief executive Sally Collier, Labour said the weight given to past results from individual schools had caused ""a mass of discriminatory impacts"". This, it said, was ""bound to disadvantage a whole range of groups with protected characteristics, in breach of a range of anti-discrimination legislation"". It said Ofqual's policy of not allowing any right of appeal ""beyond errors of application in the system"" was also unlawful. The opposition are pressing Mr Williamson to make clear when he was first informed about concerns about the algorithm and what legal advice he received before approving its use. ""Ofqual and the Secretary of State have been fully in the knowledge that the standardisation formula that was being used was unlawful,"" it said. ""It is regrettable that only when threatened with legal action that the government finally conceded to do what Labour have been calling for; for grades to be allocated based on CAGs."" The decision to allow students to use the grades estimated by their teachers - or stick to the grades provided by the algorithm if they were higher - followed similar decisions in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Labour is seeking assurances students who received offers from universities at clearing will not now lose them. Several institutions have said they will honour all offers made to students before and immediately after the original results were announced but many students have said their places have since been withdrawn. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson said it was ""the right thing to act"" after results came out Labour said this was unfair and ministers needed to ""right this wrong"" immediately. It said all pupils must have their final grades confirmed by the end of the week and no-one should lose out on their first choice place ""because of government incompetence"". It is calling on ministers to ""bend over backwards"" to support students, including by helping universities to fund additional places needed to meet the demand. ""This fiasco is far from over,"" Shadow Communities Secretary Steve Reed told the BBC. ""There are many, many students that are still uncertain about whether they can go to university or which university they can go to. ""Every student that hasn't got their firm grades given to them needs to have them by the end of the week so they can start to make decisions about their future."" Students are being urged to contact their universities as soon as possible to discuss the options. The government has lifted its cap on the numbers each institution can admit but some universities are warning of potential financial ruin if students switch to other institutions in huge numbers. Meanwhile, Durham Universityhas promised a bursary and guarantee of accommodation for everyone who defers their place until 2021.

"Teams across the world are working to develop a vaccine that will be effective against Covid-19. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called it ""the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes"". But away from the high-tech science of finding a winning formula, what about the logistics of rolling out a vaccine to seven billion people worldwide? In the UK, the heart of that effort is at the Harwell Science Campus, on an ex-RAF airbase in Oxfordshire. It is going to be the UK's Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), plans for which have been brought forward by Covid-19. ""We've really compressed the timeline into almost half. So whereas we were expecting to have it ready at the end of 2022, we're now hoping to have it online in 2021,"" explains Matthew Duchars, chief executive of VMIC. Mr Duchars is yet to take a summer holiday because he knows that this place could end up producing the Oxford University vaccine. He's in constant touch with the team at the Jenner Institute, just down the road in Oxford. Construction of the UK's Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre has been brought forward He says it's a heavy responsibility. ""It's critically important, not just for the country but globally, to be able to produce these types of vaccines quickly and effectively,"" he says. ""To use an analogy - it's like baking a cake at home. You can spend hours preparing the perfect cake and now you've got to go out and bake 70 million of them and they all have to be perfect, so it's quite a challenge."" That's putting it mildly. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? Oxford vaccine triggers immune response Encouraging results in vaccine trials Oxford University has already had to secure enough temporary lab space to start manufacturing its vaccine now, even before it knows the results of its global trials. Ultimately, the human race will need to make billions of doses of several types of Covid-19 vaccines. They will all have to be manufactured, distributed and administered across the globe. The international vaccines alliance - Gavi - is urging countries to start thinking about vaccine rollout now. But it's not easy to get international co-operation, because many rich countries are already doing bilateral deals with drug companies to make sure they can secure supplies if the magic formula is found. Seth Berkley, Gavi's CEO, says one of the biggest hurdles he's facing is so-called ""vaccine nationalism"". ""I think we need all countries to be thinking about this in a globally minded way, partially because it's the right thing to do but also because it's a self-interest issue,"" he says. ""If you have large reservoirs of virus circulating in surrounding countries, you can't go back to your normal trade, travel or movement of people. It's really important to have that mindset: we're not safe, unless everybody is safe."" Human trials of the Oxford vaccine are taking place in South Africa As well as trying to make sure developing countries get access to the right vaccines, Mr Berkley has to think about the more prosaic aspects of vaccine roll-out, including whether or not there are enough glass vials in the world. There have been reports of a potential bottleneck in medical glass production. ""We were worried about that,"" Mr Berkley admits, ""so we went ahead and purchased enough vials for two billion doses, that's the number of doses we hope to have ready by the end of 2021."" If glass vials are a potential problem, then so are fridges, since most vaccines need to be kept at low temperatures. Prof Toby Peters, an expert in cold chain logistics at Birmingham University, is helping organisations like Gavi think about how they can maximise existing refrigeration capacity in developing countries. He says: ""It's not just a vaccine fridge, it's actually all the other pieces too: the pallets which move it in the planes; the vehicles that move it to the local stores, and then the motorbikes and the people who take it out right into the communities. All these have to work seamlessly."" Many more glass vials will be needed - and fridges to store them Prof Peters has been talking to global food and drink companies to explore borrowing cold chain storage to help with this mammoth project. To make the vaccine roll-out more manageable, countries will have to work out who to prioritise in their populations. Dr Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the UK's Wellcome Trust, says countries are going to have to ask some frank questions. ""Who needs this vaccine? Which are the highest risk groups? And who are the highest priority? Because what we're pretty clear about is any initial vaccine is likely to outstrip supply, so choices will need to be made."" Even doing the actual vaccinations will be tricky. The UK, for example, is looking at a template which uses its network of polling stations as a way to process the population. But for poorer countries it's even more daunting. Dr Weller insists strong healthcare systems will be key, with healthcare workers who have the right technical skills to immunise the target groups. The scientists all think some kind of vaccine will be found. But many of them say they are kept awake at night by the sheer scale of what needs to be done to get it to billions of people.

"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi refused to leave his cell as a court heard emotional testimony from bereaved relatives. Hashem Abedi is due to be sentenced for the murder of 22 people in the 2017 terror attack. At a two-day court hearing, family members of some of those killed have told of the impact of their loss. One bereaved mother told the Old Bailey Abedi's ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"". The 23-year-old worked with his brother to source materials used in the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which injured hundreds at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. During the hearing, parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Others slammed the Abedi brothers, branding them as an ""evil"" pair who launched a cowardly attack on innocent people. 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Lisa Rutherford, whose daughter Chloe was killed at the arena, said the ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"", adding that her loss was a ""pain that never leaves us"". It is normal for defendants to be present in court but Abedi - who dismissed his legal team - refused to attend.

Jayne Jones, mother of 14-year-old Nell Jones, said words did not ""come anywhere near"" describing their grief. ""We miss her laughter, her wicked sense of humour. But we cherish her legacy,"" she said. June Tron, the mother of Gateshead plumber Philip Tron, 32, told the court ""my world fell apart"" when she was told he had died and she still suffers nightmares about the bomb going off. ""I felt immense guilt. I just want the trial over. I want justice so I can start to breathe."" Michael Thompson said his family was ""going from day to day on autopilot"" since his daughter Michelle Kiss, 45, had been ""taken from us in the most terrible and cowardly way"". ""We believe there is more good in the world than bad but unfortunately it only takes one bad person to devastate and destroy so many lives,"" he said. Read more:'There is always that empty chair where she should be' In March this year Abedi was found guilty of 22 counts of murder, one count of attempted murder - encompassing injured survivors - and conspiring to cause explosions. Abedi would have been eligible for a whole-life term had he been over the age of 21 at the time of the bombing, the court heard. Mr Justice Baker said it was a ""matter for Parliament who pass legislation which prevents the court of making a whole-life order in the circumstances of this case"". The Old Bailey was told some of the victim impact and witness statements should not be read in open court, but instead be considered by the judge in private.

"Peers will not be packing their bags and moving to York after a proposal to relocate the House of Lords during rebuilding work was effectively axed. Boris Johnson wants the Parliamentary authorities to look at the idea of moving the Lords out of London while the Palace of Westminster is revamped. But the body in charge of the project said it would not be considered. The government says it is up to MPs and peers to decide but it will continue pushing for a move out of London. The government is also considering setting up a new government ""hub"" in York. PM suggests York as Parliament's temporary home Ministers 'looking into' relocating House of Lords MPs and peers agreed in 2018 to a plan that would see both Houses move to temporary facilities near the existing site - a ""full decant"" - to allow essential repairs and upgrades to be made to the crumbling Victorian palace. Amid concerns about the cost - estimated at almost Â£4bn in 2014 - a review of the plans is being carried out by the Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body and Delivery Authority. The idea of moving the Upper Chamber out of London first emerged in January. Downing Street was said to be keen on the idea as a way of demonstrating its commitment to its ""levelling up"" agenda to spread opportunity and decision-making outside London and the south-east of England. But the Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body, whose members include MPs and peers and which is chaired by property expert Liz Peace, said such a move would not form part of its review. In a letter to the prime minister, it said there were ""constitutional implications"" for moving MPs and peers outside London ""which makes this a matter for both Houses to determine rather than for our review"". ""This option will not, therefore, be considered as part of the scope of the strategic review,"" they said. It said urgent action was needed to address the state of parts of the Palace of Westminster, which it said was ""falling apart faster than they can be fixed"". It added: ""In line with best practice, we remain committed to developing a business case that will set out in detail the options for restoring Parliament including cost estimates and timescales."" Several leading peers criticised the York plan, saying it was impractical to separate the Lords from the Commons. Lord Speaker Lord Fowler said it was ""gesture politics"" while Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the idea was ""great PR"" but questioned how it would work. But the Lib Dem leader of City of York Council has said such a move could bring real economic benefits to the city and the wider region in the form of high-skilled jobs. The government recently declined to confirm or deny reports that a feasibility study has been carried out in possible sites in the city.

"The number of children crossing the Channel in dinghies has risen Update 4th September 2020: French authoritieshave since saidthat they believe the victim was 28 years old. A 16-year-old from Sudan who disappeared at sea has been found dead on a French beach. French politicians believe the boy, whose body was found in Calais, went missing while attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat. A search operation began after another migrant was found with hypothermia on the shore at about 02:00 BST. He told authorities that his friend, who could not swim, was missing after their makeshift boat capsized. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said the death of the young migrant was a ""brutal reminder"" that people smugglers exploit the vulnerable. Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said that the government was wrong to focus only on the criminals organising crossings, adding that reports the boy had pushed off in a makeshift boat made it ""likely that people smugglers weren't even involved"". She called on the Home Secretary to instead ""turn her attention immediately to creating safe and legal routes so that no on else suffers the same fate"". Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said the government's response to the rise in crossings had been ""lacking in compassion and competence"". He urged ministers to ""step up work with international partners to find a humanitarian solution to this crisis, which is costing lives"". Border Force and the RNLI are thought to have picked up several groups from dinghies on Wednesday The Home Office would not confirm whether the boy had been trying to reach the UK. Asked to clarify if there was evidence people smugglers were involved in the death, it said it would not comment on an investigation that is being lead by the prosecutors' office in Boulogne-sur-Mer. A further 41 people on four boats were rescued by French authorities after getting into difficulty on Wednesday. One had fallen overboard and was pulled from sea at about 07:30. More than 4,800 people have reached the UK after crossing the Channel in about 360 small boats this year. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The death of a 16-year-old child in the Channel is a tragedy. My thoughts are with his loved ones. ""This is a humanitarian crisis that needs a compassionate response."" The Bishop of Dover, Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, said: ""People who try to cross the Channel seeking safety and security are not criminals - they are human beings, like you and I. ""Human beings who should be afforded the dignity and respect and rights that so many of us take for granted. ""It is a travesty that this young man will never see his hoped-for future, that his family has been deprived of seeing him grow up."" Clare Moseley, of refugee charity Care4Calais, said she was ""absolutely devastated by the unnecessary death of this child"". ""We can only imagine the fear he felt and our hearts go out to his family,"" she said. Ms Moseley said the boys the charity supports in Calais were ""fun to be with despite the horrors they have been through"". ""Some are cheeky, some are smart, some like football, some like books. None deserve to be here and none deserve to die alone in the sea."" Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Home Office seeks navy help over migrant crossings Council has 'no capacity for more child migrants' Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: ""It should not be the case that people feel they have no choice but to make such dangerous journeys in their search for protection. ""At a time when more than 1% of the world's population has been displaced, we need countries to work together to provide the best humanitarian outcome."" French minister Marlene Schiappa said the boy's body was found on a beach in Sangatte, Calais, on Wednesday. Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont said it ""seems pretty sure he drowned in the Channel"". Earlier this month, Dan O'Mahoney was appointed as the UK's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander in a bid to make the Channel route ""unviable"" for small boat crossings. But Mr Dumont said ""whatever the British government implement in the Channel, people will try to cross"". ""The more difficult it will be to cross, the more dangerous it will be,"" he added. He said the ""only solution"" was to allow migrants living in Europe to claim asylum in the UK, without having to land in Britain. Immigration minister Chris Philp said the ""awful tragedy near Calais shows how dangerous this migration route is"". ""We will redouble our work to agree and implement a new plan with France with the aim of completely stopping these boat crossings, which are facilitated by ruthless criminals and which risk lives.""

"Coronavirus tests are to be carried out on more people in the government's monitoring programme to get a better idea of the spread of the virus. The Office for National Statistics'Infection Survey,externalwill test 150,000 people a fortnight in England by October, up from 28,000 now. The survey is separate from themass testing programme of people with symptoms,externalto diagnose cases. For the survey, a representative sample of the general population is tested. That means it can provide estimates for the true spread of the virus. The diagnostic testing programme, which provides daily totals, largely relies on people with symptoms coming forward. Some people do not display symptoms when they are infected so the daily totals are an underestimate of the amount of infection that is around. As part of the expansion of the programme, data will also be gathered in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted to see more rapid-turnaround testing for the public. Currently most tests that are taken have to be sent off to labs to be processed - and so people often wait a day for the results. But the government is assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of new types of tests that can deliver results on the spot. He said this was a ""huge priority"" for government as it could make it easier to reopen parts of the economy and perhaps reduce the restrictions around quarantining when you come from high-risk areas abroad. But he was unable to give a timeframe for that as the tests have not be proven to work yet. What tests are available? The ONS study helps us to understand whether rising numbers of people testing positive is down to more testing or more virus. It uses a small sample of people to inform the national picture, like tasting soup with a teaspoonful. At the moment, spotting just 10 infections a week, it takes a while before it can tell whether a rise is a spike or just a blip. A bigger spoon means it will spot the national and regional trends faster. That means we're less likely to be caught unawares if the virus comes back with a vengeance in the autumn. But it still won't see many infections in a town or small city, so won't become our main local outbreak detector. Speaking about the ONS survey expansion, he said the monitoring programme was currently the ""single most important tool"" the government had for making policy decisions around coronavirus because it helped it understand how the disease was spreading. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said expanding the ONS survey would allow the government to be ""more accurate and more localised"" in its response. He added that it would help the government with its ""biggest challenge"", which was finding people who were asymptomatic but could still pass the virus on. It tests thousands of people in households representative of the population, whether or not they have coronavirus symptoms. The results help experts estimate the weekly reproduction (R) number and growth rate of the virus - which tells us if new coronavirus infections are rising or shrinking. The survey also provides important information about the socio-demographic characteristics of the people and households who have Covid-19. According to last week's results,coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, with an estimated one in 1,900, or 28,300 people currently infected. At the start of the pilot study, led by the ONS and the University of Oxford in partnership with the Department for Health and Social Care, around 20,000 households were invited to take part, with the aim of achieving data from around 10,000 households. Since the end of May, additional households have been invited to take part in the survey each week (roughly 5,000 a week), with an additional 15,000 households contacted in July. By beefing up the numbers participating, the ONS will be able to assess what is going on in much greater detail. Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, said that the survey would be the biggest of its kind in this country. ""Vigilance is key to containing this pandemic and the extra data on the spread of infections and antibodies at local level will be invaluable to the planning of effective local responses."" Prof Sarah Walker, of Oxford University, who is a co-leader of the survey, added: ""The added numbers will give us an awful lot of information about how this is all going to play out over the next six months. ""The key question is 'can I get it again?' and because we are going back to households and because we will have enough people we can answer that question, not just overall, but by age, gender and ethnicity."" The extended survey should be up and running by October when government experts are expecting there to be surges in infection. People who take part have routine nose or throat swabs to see if they currently have coronavirus. The survey currently has 60,000 people enrolled - not all of them are tested every fortnight. The aim is to increase this to 400,000 people across the entire project in England, and there will be proportionate increases in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

"Matt Hancock said evidence suggests transmission at workplaces is low The UK government is not considering making the wearing of face masks compulsory in offices and workplaces, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. It comes as France ruled that coverings must be worn in most workplaces following a surge in coronavirus cases. ""We constantly look at the scientific advice and the answer here is that we are not currently considering doing that,"" said Mr Hancock. Face coverings are currently required in some indoor settings in the UK. For example, they are compulsory for customers in shops inEngland,external,Scotland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external- but not for staff. They are also required for anyone travelling on public transport anywhere in the UK. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? Earlier this week, France announced that from 1 September masks would be compulsory in all shared spaces in offices and factories where there is more than one worker present. Previously, the French government only advised wearing masks at work when distancing is not possible Masks are also compulsory in some busy outdoor areas in Paris and other French cities. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether the UK would follow France and introduce masks in workplaces, Mr Hancock said it was not being considered. ""And the reason is that the evidence from NHS Test and Trace for where people catch the disease is that, very largely, they catch it from one household meeting another household, usually in one of their homes. ""And so it's that household transmission that is the core root of passing on this virus in this country. ""The amount of people who have caught it in workplaces is relatively low, we think, from the evidence we've got."" It comesas the government announced on Wednesday,externalthat a further 16 people had died with the virus, taking the UK's total to 41,397. These are deaths for any reason within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Should I be returning to work? What coronavirus will do to our offices and homes What's the future for the office? There is currently no universal rule for workers to wear face masks at work in the UK. However, thegovernment has set out guidance,externalfor particular industries. For example, hairdressers and beauticiansare advised to cover their faces,externalbecause it's harder to socially distance with the public. Staff that work in shops or other indoor settings do not have to wear face coverings - although the government suggests businesses ""consider their use where appropriate"". From the start of August,the government changed its guidance about work,,externalno longer ordering people to work from home where they can. It is now up to employers to decide whether staff can return to the workplace - as long as it is safe to do so. Previous restrictions on the use of public transport in England have also been removed, meaning anyone can now use it. This video can not be played Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Over the past few months, there have been outbreaks among workersat meat processing plantsas well as factories. Most recently,there has been an outbreak at a factoryin Newark, Nottinghamshire, which makes desserts for Waitrose and Tesco. In other coronavirus developments: Heathrow Airport is planning to offer coronavirus tests so that passengers returning to the UK from some countries would not have to spend the full 14 days in quarantine if they test negative. The plan needs government approval but, if rolled out, travellers would be tested at the airport and then again at home a few days later. If they pass both tests they will be able to stop quarantining. Mr Hancock told LBC the government was working with Heathrow on the plan but it must be made ""safe and secure"" A survey that tests people in the UKis to be expanded,to get a better idea of how many are infected at any one time. The aim is to test 150,000 people a fortnight in England by October, up from 28,000 now Mr Hancockrevealed the governmentis ""absolutely looking at"" lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine, after fears there will not be enough places for all the students with the grades to get in European researchers have saidthe loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"A man who rammed three motorcyclists on a motorway in Berlin is being investigated for what prosecutors say was ""an Islamist-motivated attack"". Three people were seriously injured when the suspect's car collided with motorbikes and cars on the A100 motorway shortly before 19:00 (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening. Witnesses said the 30-year-old Iraqi suspect claimed to have a ""dangerous object"" in a box of ammunition. Work tools were later found inside. Police and prosecutors say the series of crashes in three separate places on the A100 near the centre of Berlin were being considered as ""deliberate attacks on other road users"". Berlin prosecutor's office spokesman Martin Steltner told reporters the man was suspected of ""in effect hunting down motorcyclists"". The attack is being investigated as having either a political or religious motive but prosecutors have not ruled out psychological issues. ""Because of the circumstances we don't see this as a random accident,"" Mr Steltner said. ""Latest indications point to an Islamist-motivated attack."" At least six people were hurt, including three who were in a serious condition In the first incident, the suspect's black Opel car seriously injured a motorcyclist, then drove on targeting two more, eventually ramming the third motorcyclist into the path of his car. The third motorcyclist is reportedly in a life-threatening condition. Pictures of the car and the badly damaged motorbike in front of the bonnet gave an indication of the force of the attack on the motorcyclist, near a busy interchange on the A100 in the Tempelhof area of the German capital. After the crashes, the man was said to have placed a metal box on the road. According to sources quoted by the Tagesspiegel website, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""Nobody come closer or else you'll die."" Named by German media as Samrad A, the suspect lives in refugee accommodation and reports suggest he may have been radicalised there. He is expected to face three charges of attempted murder. Before the attack, the suspect posted pictures of his car on Facebook, along with religious phrases. Public broadcaster ARD reported that the suspect had received psychiatric treatment in the past after making threats to kill but he was not seen as closely linked to militant Islamists. Berlin Christmas market attacker shot dead in Milan The series of accidents on the A100 caused three hours of closures on the motorway on Tuesday, including on the central KurfÃ¼rstendamm. The centre of Berlin was targeted in December 2016, when Islamist militant Anis Amri drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and leaving 49 others injured. Amri fled to the northern Italian city of Milan, where he was shot dead by police. Amri, a Tunisian, had spent several years in jail in Italy.

"Many railway season ticket holders and commuters will see a 1.6% rise in fares from January despite a slump in passenger demand. About half of rail fares are pegged to July's Retail Price Index, which defied forecasts and rose from 1.1% in June. The government said any fare increases will be the lowest for four years, but passenger groups called for reductions. Scotland will delay changing its fares as it considers reviewing its system to make it more affordable. The changes will affect mainly English and Welsh commuters. In Northern Ireland, fares are set by state-owned operator Translink, and don't use RPI. Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""We expect any rail fare rise to be the lowest in four years come January and any increase will go straight to ensuring crucial investment in our railways. ""Taxpayers have been very generous in their support to keep trains running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and whilst it's only fair that passengers also contribute to maintaining and improving the services they use, a lower rise will help ensure the system returns to strength."" PPE costs add to inflation in July What is the UK inflation rate? Passenger watchdog Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said a system that fits ""the way we live and travel now"" is needed, and not ""season tickets designed for city gents in the last century"". Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, told the BBC's Today programme that the government is ultimately in charge of the price increases and that the industry would like broader reform of fares to make flexible travel easier. The rail rise compares to 2.8% last year and is the lowest since 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which means a smaller price increase for travellers than last year. But figures from the government'sOffice of Rail and Road,externalshow passenger numbers in January to March fell 11.4% compared to the prior year. Those figures only partially cover the scale of the drop in rail journeys taken, as travel restrictions only started on 16 March and lockdown on 23 March. Figures for April to June, due out in October, are likely to be much starker. When lockdown was announced, the government said passenger numbers had dropped by 70% since the pandemic began. To stop those firms from going under, the government thensuspended all rail franchise agreements, which govern how many trains run each hour and restrict how much the companies that run them can charge for tickets and scrapped payments to government. Currently, the network is being financially managed by the government and the companies are receiving a flat fee. While generally profitable ventures, some train operating companies have had a difficult few years. South Western Railway's operating companyposted a Â£137m lossfor the 2019 financial year, which it blamed on strikes and unreliable infrastructure. The loss put the franchise at risk, it said. Abellio ScotRail, which runs Scotland's services, posted a Â£10m loss for the 15 months to March 2019. And Northern wasstripped of its franchisein January following months of chaos when new timetables were brought in. Using RPI to manage rail fares has faced criticism for some time. The ONS dumped the measure as a national statistic, favouring consumer price inflation (CPI), which is usually lower. The UK Statistics Authority recommended in 2019 that the publication of the RPI should be stopped and that, in the meantime, it should use the same data sources used to calculate CPIH, an inflation measure that includes some housing costs. The UK Statistics Authority and the Treasury are consulting on how to fix RPI. The ONS monitors the prices of a selection of goods and services commonly bought by British households. In CPI terms, what cost Â£100 last year should cost Â£101 today.

"Apple boss Tim Cook Tech giant Apple has become the first US company to be valued at $2tn (Â£1.5tn) on the stock market. It reached the milestone just two years after becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company in 2018. Its share price hit $467.77 in mid-morning trading in the US on Wednesday to push it over the $2tn mark. The only other company to reach the $2tn level was state-backed Saudi Aramco after it listed its shares last December. But the oil giant's value has slipped back to $1.8tn since then and Apple surpassed it to become the world's most valuable traded company at the end of July. The iPhone-maker's shares have leapt more than 50% this year, despite the coronavirus crisis forcing it to shut retail stores and political pressure over its links to China. In fact, its share price has doubled since its low point in March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the markets. Tech firms, which have been viewed as winners despite lockdowns, have seen their stock surge in recent weeks, even though the US is in recession. Apple posted strong third quarter figures towards the end of July, including $59.7bn of revenue and double-digit growth in its products and services segments. The next most valuable US company is Amazon which is worth around $1.7tn. US stocks hit new high after coronavirus crash Apple helped make 'top secret' government iPod Apple's rapid share price rise is ""an impressive feat within a short period of time"", said Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight. ""The last few months have underlined the importance of users and households alike to own better quality devices, connections and services and with Apple's strong broad portfolio of devices and a growing services offering, there are plentiful opportunities for future growth."" He said the arrival of gigabit connectivity broadband would offer Apple ""endless possibilities"". ""All eyes are now on the eagerly anticipated 5G iPhone which will fuel further consumer demand,"" he added.

He temporarily stepped aside from the role overseeing her personal affairs in 2019, citing his own health problems. Some of Spears' fans believe she was forced into the arrangement, and have been running a #FreeBritney campaign. Jamie Spears has been Britney's conservator since 2008 ""Britney is strongly opposed to James' return as conservator of her person,"" according to a court document filed to the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. It explained that the 38-year-old singer was in favour of the role, which she said had ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer"". However, she wants her manager Jodi Montgomery, who stepped in for her father during his absence, to permanently oversee her personal affairs, once the conservatorship is up for extension again after 22 August. Britney Spears' father steps down as conservator What exactly is the #FreeBritney campaign? Mr Spears has also had oversight of her financial affairs. He took sole control last year when his co-conservator, a lawyer, resigned. However, the court has been told the singer would now like a ""qualified corporate fiduciary"" to take over her finances. Her lawyer said he expected that Jamie Spears would ""aggressively"" contest the request to push him aside. But the legal documents said: ""We are now at a point where the conservatorship must be changed substantially in order to reflect the major changes in her current lifestyle and her stated wishes."" It also revealed that Britney has no plans to perform again soon. She last performed live in October 2018, before cancelling a planned 2019 Las Vegas residency due to her father's ill health, noting how""it's important to always put your family first"".,external A hearing in the conservatorship case is scheduled for Wednesday in Los Angeles. Britney Spears has not controlled her financial or many of her career decisions since 2008 under this court-enacted agreement. A conservatorship is usually granted for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Essentially, for the last dozen years, her father and attorney have managed her assets and personal life - including being able to restrict her visitors and communicate with doctors about her treatment. Britney comes back from the brink The star began behaving erratically in 2007 after her divorce from Kevin Federline, and she lost custody of their two children (although she has frequent visits). Her alleged mental breakdowns took place in the public eye - she made headlines for shaving her head and was photographed hitting a paparazzo's car with an umbrella - and went to rehab facilities several times. She was placed in psychiatric care after refusing to surrender her sons in a stand-off with the police, and the conservatorship was put in place in early 2008. In the years under the conservatorship, she has released three albums, completed a two-yearLas Vegas residency, and served as a judge on The X Factor. Fans protested outside a conservatorship hearing in July What began as a hashtag in 2009 has mushroomed into an online campaign by fans who accuse Britney's father and others of being overly and unnecessarily controlling. Some protested outside the last court hearing in July, and an online petition has gained more than 100,000 signatures. They believe they need to rescue their idol. Those close to the star say the campaign is based on a conspiracy theory. The singer herself has not commented on the campaign. She does post regular photos and videos on Instagram, mainly showing her dancing. There have been claims that she doesn't control her own posts and that old photos are being recycled. But in an Instagram video in May, she said: ""For those of you who don't think I post my own videos... you're wrong."" And last weekend, she posted a picture showing a time and date ""so you guys know these aren't old"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

However, in April she revealed on Instagram that she accidentally burned down her home gym, which concerned some fans.

"Coronavirus tests are to be carried out on more people in the government's monitoring programme to get a better idea of the spread of the virus. The Office for National Statistics'Infection Survey,externalwill test 150,000 people a fortnight in England by October, up from 28,000 now. The survey is separate from themass testing programme of people with symptoms,externalto diagnose cases. For the survey, a representative sample of the general population is tested. That means it can provide estimates for the true spread of the virus. The diagnostic testing programme, which provides daily totals, largely relies on people with symptoms coming forward. Some people do not display symptoms when they are infected so the daily totals are an underestimate of the amount of infection that is around. As part of the expansion of the programme, data will also be gathered in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted to see more rapid-turnaround testing for the public. Currently most tests that are taken have to be sent off to labs to be processed - and so people often wait a day for the results. But the government is assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of new types of tests that can deliver results on the spot. He said this was a ""huge priority"" for government as it could make it easier to reopen parts of the economy and perhaps reduce the restrictions around quarantining when you come from high-risk areas abroad. But he was unable to give a timeframe for that as the tests have not be proven to work yet. What tests are available? The ONS study helps us to understand whether rising numbers of people testing positive is down to more testing or more virus. It uses a small sample of people to inform the national picture, like tasting soup with a teaspoonful. At the moment, spotting just 10 infections a week, it takes a while before it can tell whether a rise is a spike or just a blip. A bigger spoon means it will spot the national and regional trends faster. That means we're less likely to be caught unawares if the virus comes back with a vengeance in the autumn. But it still won't see many infections in a town or small city, so won't become our main local outbreak detector. Speaking about the ONS survey expansion, he said the monitoring programme was currently the ""single most important tool"" the government had for making policy decisions around coronavirus because it helped it understand how the disease was spreading. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said expanding the ONS survey would allow the government to be ""more accurate and more localised"" in its response. He added that it would help the government with its ""biggest challenge"", which was finding people who were asymptomatic but could still pass the virus on. It tests thousands of people in households representative of the population, whether or not they have coronavirus symptoms. The results help experts estimate the weekly reproduction (R) number and growth rate of the virus - which tells us if new coronavirus infections are rising or shrinking. The survey also provides important information about the socio-demographic characteristics of the people and households who have Covid-19. According to last week's results,coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, with an estimated one in 1,900, or 28,300 people currently infected. At the start of the pilot study, led by the ONS and the University of Oxford in partnership with the Department for Health and Social Care, around 20,000 households were invited to take part, with the aim of achieving data from around 10,000 households. Since the end of May, additional households have been invited to take part in the survey each week (roughly 5,000 a week), with an additional 15,000 households contacted in July. By beefing up the numbers participating, the ONS will be able to assess what is going on in much greater detail. Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, said that the survey would be the biggest of its kind in this country. ""Vigilance is key to containing this pandemic and the extra data on the spread of infections and antibodies at local level will be invaluable to the planning of effective local responses."" Prof Sarah Walker, of Oxford University, who is a co-leader of the survey, added: ""The added numbers will give us an awful lot of information about how this is all going to play out over the next six months. ""The key question is 'can I get it again?' and because we are going back to households and because we will have enough people we can answer that question, not just overall, but by age, gender and ethnicity."" The extended survey should be up and running by October when government experts are expecting there to be surges in infection. People who take part have routine nose or throat swabs to see if they currently have coronavirus. The survey currently has 60,000 people enrolled - not all of them are tested every fortnight. The aim is to increase this to 400,000 people across the entire project in England, and there will be proportionate increases in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

"The cluster was linked to bars in the city A local lockdown in Aberdeen will be extended for another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. Pubs and restaurants were shut two weeks ago, and restrictions placed on travel and visits to other households, after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to bars and nightlife in the city. Ms Sturgeon said the lockdown was having an impact - but that it was ""not yet safe"" to lift the restrictions. Aberdeen City Council said it did not support continuing the lockdown. A midweek review will be carried out on Sunday, and Ms Sturgeon said she hoped some restrictions could be eased next Wednesday. This could involve lower-risk businesses, such as non-licensed cafes. Updates on coronavirus in Scotland Restrictions 'having an impact on cases' What are the local lockdown rules? Aberdeen lockdown 'feels never-ending' Ms Sturgeon said 15 of the 50 new cases in Scotland on Wednesday were in the Grampian area. There have now been 398 cases since 26 July in Grampian, 226 of which have been associated with the Aberdeen cluster. ""We are not yet in a position to say that this outbreak is over or completely under control,"" said Ms Sturgeon. She said there was some evidence that the original cluster, linked with bars and nightlife in the city, was being contained. ""However, we are also continuing to see a number of individual cases and other smaller clusters in the city,"" she said. ""That is not necessarily unusual for an outbreak of this scale, but it is something we must monitor very carefully because these cases don't appear to be linked to the original outbreak."" The first minister said she accepted that there would be disappointment at the continuation of the restrictions. But she added: ""Moving too quickly with transmission levels as they remain just now would, in our view, risk the hard-won progress that people in Aberdeen have made."" However, the administration leaders on Aberdeen City Council - which is run by a coalition of Conservative, Labour and Independent councillors - said they did not support the city being locked down any longer. Co-leader Jenny Laing said: ""It is apparent that Covid-19 has already had a significant impact on our local economy and continuing with the current restrictions is only going to make a bad economic situation even worse."" She said that at a meeting on Tuesday the incident management team said they believed the situation was now under adequate control, and that mitigation measures could be put in place to allow lower-risk settings to open from Saturday. Co-leader Douglas Lumsden warned more than 5,000 jobs were at risk. Aberdeen's Lib Dem group leader Ian Yuill said the administration's stance was ""completely irresponsible"", adding: ""The last thing our city needs just now is confusion and uncertainty."" NHS Grampian said the local incident management team had been asked to make recommendations to the Scottish government. It said the team, which was set up to manage and investigate the cluster, supported the ""precautionary approach"" and the decision to maintain the restrictions. ""We want to encourage everyone in Aberdeen City to keep following the enhanced restrictions,"" it added. The current restrictions, which apply to 228,000 people in Aberdeen, are: bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs are closed no travel more than five miles for leisure or holidays no travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you live in Aberdeenshire no indoor visits with other households visiting suspended for most hospitals A Â£1m support fund has been set up for the city, with grants of up to Â£1,500 available for hospitality businesses. Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""It's good the government has accepted that business is struggling. Mike Henderson said there was nothing in place after furlough ends ""We've already seen business closures and we fear that we may see more, and the job losses that come with that. ""Of course Â£1m sounds like a chunky figure but at an individual business level at up to Â£1,500, that isn't going to make the difference between survival or not."" Mike Henderson is involved a number of businesses in Aberdeen as a live entertainment booker, including Bridge Street Social Club. He expressed concerns about the future. ""Once the furlough ends, there's really no plans there - there's nothing in place for us,"" he said. ""That's why we've started a crowdfunding opportunity for ourselves and our 50 staff to keep them in the job."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where? RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

"Joe Exotic is currently serving a 22 year jail sentence The exotic cat zoo made famous by the Netflix series Tiger King is closing for good. Current owner Jeff Lowe announced the decision ina Facebook post,external, blaming ""the pressures of"" animal rights charity Peta. It comes after a federal judge ordered the zoo behanded over toCarole Baskin as part of a ruling in a $1m (Â£800,000) trademark dispute. That meant the current operators had to be out in 120 days. Jeff Lowe is the former business partner of Joe Exotic, who is currently serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse. ""The Tiger King phenomenon has definitely changed our lives in many ways,"" he said in his post. ""It has brought us more attention than any human deserves, good and bad. ""It has, and probably will continue to make us a target of every nutjob and animal rights loon in the world, but we are prepared."" Jeff Lowe added that he has voluntarily forfeited his United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor's license - which allowed him to buy and sell animals - due to the park's permanent closure.

""Suspiciously, less than 24 hours after I contacted the USDA to voluntarily forfeit my license, they notify me that they are suspending my license for 21 days for a litany of falsehoods."" Brittany Peet, who works on the captive animal team at Peta, called for Jeff Lowe's license to be permanently removed. ""Peta looks forward to seeing every one of the long-suffering animals at the G.W.

Joe Exotic's rival Carole Baskin Tiger King, which became a huge hit on Netflix right at the start of lockdown, tells of Joe Exotic's colourful life and his rivalry with Carole Baskin, the owner of an animal sanctuary in Florida. ""It has also provided us with an unfathomable source of income,"" said Jeff. The streaming service has reportedly secured the rights to a second season - but the show's popularity means there are already lots of spin-offs on the way, including  Nicolas Cagestarring as Joe Exotic in an eight-part series. Jeff Lowe added that his ""new park"" will be a ""private film set for Tiger King related television content for cable and streaming services"". Carole Baskin herself hasn't been far from the headlines since the series came out. Earlier this month it was revealed she isfacing a lawsuitfrom the family of her ex-husband Don Lewis, who disappeared in 1997 and is presumed dead. There are a number of theories over what happened to him, including suggestions Carole was responsible after receiving most of his Â£4.5m estate - something she has always strongly denied. The series brought those theories to a wide audience, and immediately after its release Carole saidthe show had ""no regard for the truth"". She said it ""has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don 21 years ago. ""The series presents this without any regard for the truth or in most cases even giving me an opportunity before publication to rebut the absurd claims. ""They did not care about truth.

"This video can not be played ""Tourists might not return if they feel unwelcome"", warns academic As tensions between locals and tourists rise in rural areas, there are warnings the industry could be at risk if visitors are not made welcome. Locals in Morfa Nefyn, on Gwynedd's Llyn Peninsula, say this year has been the busiest season they have ever seen. But with every weekend drawing bank holiday-sized crowds, it is causing tension. The Welsh Government said the priority is to ""grow tourism by listening to residents, visitors and businesses"". Professor Michael Woods, director of centre for Welsh politics and society at Aberystwyth University, said: ""If people are getting the message coming into rural Wales that they're not welcome, they're not going to come back. Crackdown considered amidst camper van problems Holiday bookings boom as tourism reopens 'More than 500 cars' parked on Snowdonia roads ""Yes, we need to think about diversifying the economy in future but we need to be careful and manage it in such a way that we aren't undermining the economy we have already in rural Wales."" Tourists in Nefyn said it was much busier this year but were ""not too worried"" Lois Llywelyn Williams, a student at Oxford University, said after returning home for the summer she has noticed ""tensions have certainly come up"". ""Every conversation I have in recent weeks has been about the increase in people here, the traffic is seriously heavy and the lack of social distancing,"" she said. Locals are worried about the number of visitors and second homes in the area Iwan ap Llyfnwy runs Cwrw Llyn in nearby Nefyn. The company was set up with employment for local people in mind, but he says they are dependent on tourism. ""Tourism is great. We welcome everybody here, and we're dependent on them as a business, but the issue of second homes worries me,"" he said. ""I've got children myself and I tend to worry how are the next generation going to afford to buy their first property."" Gwyneth Hughes, who has run a clothes shop in Morfa Nefyn for 35 years, added: ""I welcome the tourists, but we don't want it to be overcrowded. We want it to be safe."" Shop owner Gwyneth Hughes says safety is the priority Elfed Roberts is a local businessman, running Spar shops across the peninsula and is currently developing new business units in Nefyn. He wants local people to start businesses there to create jobs for local people. ""My heart is saying one thing and my head another,"" he said. ""My heart is saying we don't want people here, just to safeguard ourselves but my head says we need them here, we need people spending here in order to support the jobs of the people I employ at the moment."" On a clear day, you can see Anglesey from the beach at Morfa Nefyn, another area of Wales which welcomes thousands of tourists every year. Virginia Crosbie, the Conservative MP for Ynys Mon, said she is delighted to hear the hotels and caravan sites are welcoming lots of tourists but recognises that the industry does not provide the highly skilled jobs the island needs. ""There's a significant dependence on tourism here and that makes the economy very focussed on the summer months and it makes the winter really, really tough,"" she said. ""So, for the young people here, I want to ensure that if they are ambitious they can stay on the island, that's why I'm focussed on trying to deliver those high skilled jobs.""

He wants to study Maths, Physics, AS Economics and Further Maths - for that, he needs certain results in his GCSE qualifications. After a huge backlash to the way A-level and GCSE grades were determined using a controversial algorithm, teachers' assessments will now be used for all students - apart from where the algorithm gives a higher grade. Rijul still has reservations: ""The results won't be what I could have got if I'd taken exams but it's the best they can do. And if my results are good I'll be happy and I can just chill. ""The teachers know us well so I just have to hope."" We'll be covering GCSE results day live on the BBC News website - do join us. An entire class of primary pupils in Scotland, and their teacher, have been asked to self-isolate after a case of coronavirus. Contact tracers are working to identify close contacts at St Albert's Primary School in Pollokshields on the south side of Glasgow. A council spokeswoman said ""control measures are in place at the school, and there is currently no evidence of transmission within the school itself"". The number of pupils and staff asked to self-isolate has not been confirmed. Staff self-isolating after an outbreak of coronavirus at a sandwich factory in England's East Midlands are now having to use food banks and struggling with rent, a union has claimed. Many of the almost300 workers who tested positive at M&S supplier Greencorein Northampton are members of The Bakers' Union. The union entered a grievance with Greencore on Tuesday as its regional officer George Attwall said its members ""are now in hardship"". Attwall and branch secretary Nicolar Macari said only statutory sick pay was being paid to the vast majority of people self-isolating, and that workers ""are being evicted as a result of not being able to pay rent"" while others ""were forced to use food banks for the first time in their lives"". The union claims it is ""unfair"" workers only get statutory sick pay of Â£95.85 per week while managers are ""enjoying full company sick pay"". Greencore said it will give ""weekly paid colleagues"" a Â£400 bonus ""in recognition of the financial impact"". Read morehere. Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior US disease researcher who has become a household name amid the coronavirus pandemic, has been honoured with his own baseball bobblehead. Fauci threw out the opening pitch on 23 July at Washington DC's Nationals Park. His pitch, which missed home plate by a long way, led to the doctor getting his own baseball card - which quickly became one of top selling collectible cards in US history. The pitch quickly led to jokes, with some Twitter users pointing out that it is ""literally his job to make sure nobody catches anything"". Allow Twitter content?

The algorithm used to downgrade thousands of A-level results in England was ""unlawful"", opposition politicians have claimed. The computer-based model used by Ofqual to standardise results - after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus - breached anti-discrimination legislation as well as laws requiring it to uphold standards, Labour says. The party wants the education secretary to publish the legal advice he was given. Gavin Williamson has backed Ofqual but apologised for the hurt caused to pupils by the chaos.

Florida's governor has ordered all schools to begin in-person learning by the end of August Florida has become the fifth US state to surpass the grim milestone of 10,000 coronavirus deaths. The figure was announced as the state's health department reported 174 additional deaths. Many occured weeks ago, but have only just been confirmed to be coronavirus-related. Florida also reported 4,201 new cases on Wednesday, continuing a two-week downward trend in new infections. The other states to have hit 10,000 deaths are New York, New Jersey, California and Texas. Zoe ThomasUS business reporter Katie Kresek's show was closed in March Violinist Katie Kresek waited for more than a decade to have her own chair in a Broadway orchestra. Last year, she became the co-orchestrator and violinist for the theatre performance of Moulin Rouge! the Musical. Just 10 months after she started, the lights have gone down on her dream. She says she'll be ""heartbroken"" if the show doesn't return after theatres were closed due to the coronavirus crisis. ""It's sad that when it finally happens, it has to be cut short,"" she says. Instead of performing eight shows a week for a live audience, Kresek now records music alone in her bedroom. Her story is a familiar one to other live performers and particularly Broadway's thousands of workers. Earlier we reported that Pope Francis has called for a coronavirus vaccine to be provided to the world's poorest people if one becomes available. His comments came afterAustralia said it had secured access to a promising vaccineand would offer free doses to its entire population of 25 million people. But how close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? While no vaccine has yet been proven to protect the human body against Covid-19, medical researchers around the world are working hard to change that. About 140 potential vaccines are in early development, and dozens are now being tested on people in clinical trials.  Ultimately, billions of doses of several types of Covid-19 vaccines will need to be made to keep the virus at bay. They will have to be manufactured, distributed and administered across the globe. An emergency scheme allowing some low-risk prisoners in England and Wales near the end of their sentence to be released early is to be paused by the government. The initiativewas introduced in Aprilto help free up prison space to prevent the spread of the virus, but will be stopped at the end of August. Ministers initially said that 4,000 inmates would be eligible for
the programme - but only around 200 were freed. The government said the decision would be kept under review.

Alistair ColemanBBC Anti-disinformation Team School head teachers canât send children for a coronavirus test or have them detained without parental consent, despite viral social media posts claiming this is the case. The Facebook and WhatsApp posts are aimed at âall caring parents out thereâ, and say that schools can take a child to a coronavirus testing centre if they were showing symptoms - and then have officials detain them further without parental access if they test positive. The childrenâs commissioner for Englandhas said this is not the case,external, writing: âIt is not true that public health officers have the power to screen and assess without a parent or carer present. This power can only be exercised in the presence of an individual with responsibility for the childâ. That means a parent, carer or legal guardian must be present should a child need a test for Covid-19. In the event of a positive test, the most likely result would be self-isolation at home, the commissioner says. While powers of detention do exist, they would only be used in extreme cases where there is a flagrant risk to other people, shadow public health minister Alex Norris says. Guidance to public health officials on these powersis publicly available,externalon the UK government website.

"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi refused to leave his cell as a court heard emotional testimony from bereaved relatives. Hashem Abedi is due to be sentenced for the murder of 22 people in the 2017 terror attack. At a two-day court hearing, family members of some of those killed have told of the impact of their loss. One bereaved mother told the Old Bailey Abedi's ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"". The 23-year-old worked with his brother to source materials used in the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which injured hundreds at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. During the hearing, parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Others slammed the Abedi brothers, branding them as an ""evil"" pair who launched a cowardly attack on innocent people. 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Lisa Rutherford, whose daughter Chloe was killed at the arena, said the ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"", adding that her loss was a ""pain that never leaves us"".

"Louise Sharp, pictured with her daughters Jessica and Emily, said she needs to leave her face uncovered so she can communicate with Jessica A woman who is exempt from wearing a mask said the abuse she has received while shopping without one has left her afraid to leave the house. Louise Sharp said she needs to stay uncovered so she can communicate with her daughter who is autistic and would otherwise get distressed. However, after negative comments from another shopper sparked a panic attack two weeks ago, she can no longer shop. She said people should be more understanding of those with exemptions. Ms Sharp told BBC Newcastle she was accosted at her local supermarket in Whitley Bay and when she tried to explain that she was exempt due to both her panic and anxiety disorder as well her daughter's autism, the person still said she was ""selfish"". She ended up suffering from a panic attack and had to leave. ""I haven't been to any shop since, not once, I don't have the confidence"", she said. ""It's not right, I now feel under lockdown more than before.

"Many railway season ticket holders and commuters will see a 1.6% rise in fares from January despite a slump in passenger demand. About half of rail fares are pegged to July's Retail Price Index, which defied forecasts and rose from 1.1% in June. The government said any fare increases will be the lowest for four years, but passenger groups called for reductions. Scotland will delay changing its fares as it considers reviewing its system to make it more affordable. The changes will affect mainly English and Welsh commuters. In Northern Ireland, fares are set by state-owned operator Translink, and don't use RPI. Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""We expect any rail fare rise to be the lowest in four years come January and any increase will go straight to ensuring crucial investment in our railways. ""Taxpayers have been very generous in their support to keep trains running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and whilst it's only fair that passengers also contribute to maintaining and improving the services they use, a lower rise will help ensure the system returns to strength."" PPE costs add to inflation in July What is the UK inflation rate? Passenger watchdog Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said a system that fits ""the way we live and travel now"" is needed, and not ""season tickets designed for city gents in the last century"". Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, told the BBC's Today programme that the government is ultimately in charge of the price increases and that the industry would like broader reform of fares to make flexible travel easier. The rail rise compares to 2.8% last year and is the lowest since 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which means a smaller price increase for travellers than last year. But figures from the government'sOffice of Rail and Road,externalshow passenger numbers in January to March fell 11.4% compared to the prior year. Those figures only partially cover the scale of the drop in rail journeys taken, as travel restrictions only started on 16 March and lockdown on 23 March. Figures for April to June, due out in October, are likely to be much starker. When lockdown was announced, the government said passenger numbers had dropped by 70% since the pandemic began. To stop those firms from going under, the government thensuspended all rail franchise agreements, which govern how many trains run each hour and restrict how much the companies that run them can charge for tickets and scrapped payments to government. Currently, the network is being financially managed by the government and the companies are receiving a flat fee. While generally profitable ventures, some train operating companies have had a difficult few years. South Western Railway's operating companyposted a Â£137m lossfor the 2019 financial year, which it blamed on strikes and unreliable infrastructure. The loss put the franchise at risk, it said. Abellio ScotRail, which runs Scotland's services, posted a Â£10m loss for the 15 months to March 2019. And Northern wasstripped of its franchisein January following months of chaos when new timetables were brought in. Using RPI to manage rail fares has faced criticism for some time. The ONS dumped the measure as a national statistic, favouring consumer price inflation (CPI), which is usually lower. The UK Statistics Authority recommended in 2019 that the publication of the RPI should be stopped and that, in the meantime, it should use the same data sources used to calculate CPIH, an inflation measure that includes some housing costs. The UK Statistics Authority and the Treasury are consulting on how to fix RPI. The ONS monitors the prices of a selection of goods and services commonly bought by British households. In CPI terms, what cost Â£100 last year should cost Â£101 today.

There had been some doubt four-time winner Froome had the form to make the squad following injuries from a crash a year ago. ""Chris needs that little bit longer to get to the highest level,"" said team boss Dave Brailsford. Froome, who isleaving Ineos at the end of the current season,will instead lead them at the Vuelta a Espana in October, while Thomas will do so at the Giro d'Italia. Froome described the decision to target the Vuelta as ""more realistic"" and ""something that's deliverable"". The 35-year-old has won seven Grand Tour races, including the Vuelta in 2011 and 2017, and the Giro d'Italia in 2018. GB's Simon Yates signs new Mitchelton-Scott deal 'The unlikely hero who changed everything' Ineos to be renamed Ineos Grenadiers for Tour ""Chris is a true champion who has demonstrated incredible grit and determination to come back from his crash last year,"" added Brailsford. ""We want to support him to compete for another Grand Tour title and the Vuelta gives him that little bit more time to continue his progress to the top level."" Thomas, 34, will attempt to win his second Grand Tour in Italy, also in October. ""Geraint will target the Giro and take on the opportunity to double up his Tour de France win with another Grand Tour title, with the aim of being the first Welshman to win it,"" said Brailsford. Ineos had the dilemma of deciding who was in the best form of the three Tour-winning riders in their ranks, with Froome in an unusually perilous position, having lost the most time during three crucial warm-up races in July and August - rebuilding as he is, following hisrecovery from a fractured right femur, a broken hip, a fractured elbow and fractured ribs. Ineos' policy is that whoever is the strongest rider going into the final week of any Grand Tour will be backed by the whole team - they had been reluctant to take three riders to the Tour who could all be considered team leaders. The team will now back 23-year-old Colombian Bernal to lead the team after strong performances in the warm-up races, including victory at the Tour d'Occitanie in July. However, there are also some doubts over Bernal afterhe withdrew from the Criterium du Dauphinelast Saturday - as a precaution to ""rest a bad back,"" according to team-mate Thomas. Thomas has himself admitted to finding his best form difficult to come by, but has largely finished stages during the recent races ahead of Froome, albeit behind Bernal. Ineos - formerly Team Sky - have won the Tour de France each year since 2015 and have taken seven of the past eight Tours. Brailsford added: ""Egan will once again target the yellow jersey in France and we are very excited to give last year's Giro winner, Richard Carapaz, his debut in this year's Tour also. ""I am very proud that we have several current, and I am sure future, Grand Tour champions in the team."" Froome said: ""It's a readjustment for me. I'm in a fortunate position to be back racing, but not confident I can fulfil the necessary job that would be needed for me a this year's Tour. ""It's more realistic to be targeting the Vuelta, where there's a chance for me to get stuck into something that's deliverable."" Thomas added: ""The Giro's something I've always wanted to go back to [after crashing in 2017]. The roads, the fans, the food - I've always enjoyed it."" Froome leaves Ineos at the end of this year to join the Israel Start-Up Nation, and he will be disappointed at not being able to seek a fifth tour victory - which would equal the record for Tour wins, shared by Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain. Ineos decided not to renew Froome's contract, feeling Froome's camp lacked the grace expected in negotiations, given the support the team had shown him during his rehabilitation following his crash a year ago. Froome was also believed to have been frustrated with the team for not reprimanding last year's Tour winner Bernal over comments he made in April. The Colombian told reporters that, if he was in a winning position at this year's Tour, he would not move over to let Froome lead the team. Insiders felt the quote was fair enough, given the high status of both riders. Had things been handled differently in recent weeks, Froome could well have seen out his career at Ineos.

"A man who rammed three motorcyclists on a motorway in Berlin is being investigated for what prosecutors say was ""an Islamist-motivated attack"". Three people were seriously injured when the suspect's car collided with motorbikes and cars on the A100 motorway shortly before 19:00 (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening. Witnesses said the 30-year-old Iraqi suspect claimed to have a ""dangerous object"" in a box of ammunition. Work tools were later found inside. Police and prosecutors say the series of crashes in three separate places on the A100 near the centre of Berlin were being considered as ""deliberate attacks on other road users"". Berlin prosecutor's office spokesman Martin Steltner told reporters the man was suspected of ""in effect hunting down motorcyclists"". The attack is being investigated as having either a political or religious motive but prosecutors have not ruled out psychological issues. ""Because of the circumstances we don't see this as a random accident,"" Mr Steltner said. ""Latest indications point to an Islamist-motivated attack."" At least six people were hurt, including three who were in a serious condition In the first incident, the suspect's black Opel car seriously injured a motorcyclist, then drove on targeting two more, eventually ramming the third motorcyclist into the path of his car. The third motorcyclist is reportedly in a life-threatening condition. Pictures of the car and the badly damaged motorbike in front of the bonnet gave an indication of the force of the attack on the motorcyclist, near a busy interchange on the A100 in the Tempelhof area of the German capital. After the crashes, the man was said to have placed a metal box on the road. According to sources quoted by the Tagesspiegel website, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""Nobody come closer or else you'll die."" Named by German media as Samrad A, the suspect lives in refugee accommodation and reports suggest he may have been radicalised there. He is expected to face three charges of attempted murder. Before the attack, the suspect posted pictures of his car on Facebook, along with religious phrases. Public broadcaster ARD reported that the suspect had received psychiatric treatment in the past after making threats to kill but he was not seen as closely linked to militant Islamists. Berlin Christmas market attacker shot dead in Milan The series of accidents on the A100 caused three hours of closures on the motorway on Tuesday, including on the central KurfÃ¼rstendamm. The centre of Berlin was targeted in December 2016, when Islamist militant Anis Amri drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and leaving 49 others injured. Amri fled to the northern Italian city of Milan, where he was shot dead by police. Amri, a Tunisian, had spent several years in jail in Italy.

"Britney Spears wants the legal guardianship to reflect ""her current lifestyle and her stated wishes"" Britney Spears has asked a court not to return her father to a role that gave him control over many aspects of her life and career. Jamie Spears has been his daughter's legal conservator for 12 years, due to concerns around her mental health. He temporarily stepped aside from the role overseeing her personal affairs in 2019, citing his own health problems. Some of Spears' fans believe she was forced into the arrangement, and have been running a #FreeBritney campaign. Jamie Spears has been Britney's conservator since 2008 ""Britney is strongly opposed to James' return as conservator of her person,"" according to a court document filed to the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. It explained that the 38-year-old singer was in favour of the role, which she said had ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer"". However, she wants her manager Jodi Montgomery, who stepped in for her father during his absence, to permanently oversee her personal affairs, once the conservatorship is up for extension again after 22 August. Britney Spears' father steps down as conservator What exactly is the #FreeBritney campaign? Mr Spears has also had oversight of her financial affairs. He took sole control last year when his co-conservator, a lawyer, resigned. However, the court has been told the singer would now like a ""qualified corporate fiduciary"" to take over her finances. Her lawyer said he expected that Jamie Spears would ""aggressively"" contest the request to push him aside. But the legal documents said: ""We are now at a point where the conservatorship must be changed substantially in order to reflect the major changes in her current lifestyle and her stated wishes."" It also revealed that Britney has no plans to perform again soon. She last performed live in October 2018, before cancelling a planned 2019 Las Vegas residency due to her father's ill health, noting how""it's important to always put your family first"".,external A hearing in the conservatorship case is scheduled for Wednesday in Los Angeles. Britney Spears has not controlled her financial or many of her career decisions since 2008 under this court-enacted agreement. A conservatorship is usually granted for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Essentially, for the last dozen years, her father and attorney have managed her assets and personal life - including being able to restrict her visitors and communicate with doctors about her treatment. Britney comes back from the brink The star began behaving erratically in 2007 after her divorce from Kevin Federline, and she lost custody of their two children (although she has frequent visits). Her alleged mental breakdowns took place in the public eye - she made headlines for shaving her head and was photographed hitting a paparazzo's car with an umbrella - and went to rehab facilities several times. She was placed in psychiatric care after refusing to surrender her sons in a stand-off with the police, and the conservatorship was put in place in early 2008. In the years under the conservatorship, she has released three albums, completed a two-yearLas Vegas residency, and served as a judge on The X Factor. Fans protested outside a conservatorship hearing in July What began as a hashtag in 2009 has mushroomed into an online campaign by fans who accuse Britney's father and others of being overly and unnecessarily controlling. Some protested outside the last court hearing in July, and an online petition has gained more than 100,000 signatures. They believe they need to rescue their idol. Those close to the star say the campaign is based on a conspiracy theory. The singer herself has not commented on the campaign. She does post regular photos and videos on Instagram, mainly showing her dancing. There have been claims that she doesn't control her own posts and that old photos are being recycled. But in an Instagram video in May, she said: ""For those of you who don't think I post my own videos... you're wrong."" And last weekend, she posted a picture showing a time and date ""so you guys know these aren't old"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"The government is ""absolutely looking at"" lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The number of students studying to be doctors is regulated because of the cost and for NHS workforce planning. But after this week's changes to A-level results, universities fear there will not be enough places for all the students with the grades to get in. The body representing universities has called for the cap to be lifted. The number of places to study medicine is the latest issue thrown up by the government's U-turn on Monday to change how exam grades are awarded, following a backlash. The decision to give A-level and GCSE students the grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, means thousands of A-level students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice university offers. A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? How did Gavin Williamson survive exams U-turn? Up to 75,000 new exam certificates to be issued in Scotland Although the cap on overall student numbers has been raised, places at medical schools remain limited because the costs of training doctors far exceeds the fees paid by undergraduates. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, seen by the BBC, Universities UK sought ""urgent assurances"" that he was speaking to the Department for Health about increasing the medical student cap. ""The role of universities in training the medical workforce is essential for all regions and nations of the UK, as clearly shown by our members' response to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" the letter said. It also called more widely for ""significant financial support"" from the government as students are expected to change courses after being awarded higher grades. The body, which represents 137 institutions across the UK, said that while the change to the grading method was the right decision, it would lead to grade inflation meaning universities with lower entry requirements would face a drop in course take-up and as a result require financial help. The letter also asked for clarity on how increased student numbers could be managed alongside social distancing measures and guidance on how to handle a higher number of candidates with the required grades than available places. Asked whether he would consider lifting the cap on medical students, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""We are looking at that. ""Thankfully we've got an expansion in the number of medical places this year, the biggest number of medical places ever, because we're hiring into the NHS, we're growing the NHS and we want to make sure the NHS has the doctors it needs in the future,"" he added. ""But I am absolutely looking at this issue, yes."" He later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""But of course there's now a huge number of pupils who have the grades, and so we're working very much immediately on how we can go further than we already are."" There have beenplanned increases in the number of medical school placesavailable at English universities in recent years. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Prof Jenny Higham, principal of medical school St George's, University of London, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""Medicine is both a very practical discipline and also requires a great deal of clinical and practical experience and hence clinical placement capacity also needs to be increased."" The pandemic has meant the current students have been unable to carry out their clinical studies meaning there is a backlog in places, she said. Prof Higham added it was a high cost subject with courses funded by supplementary payments from the government as well as tuition fees, and the need to pay for clinical placements. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Conservative MP Sir John Redwood told Newsnight any changes also needed to be fair to the class of 2021 as well as ""make up to the class of 2020"", with next year's cohort needing to be assured of places if they got the necessary grades. On Tuesday, universities minister Michelle Donelan said she wanted to ensure any students who had accepted a ""different course"" than planned, as a result of being downgraded last week, should be able to ""change their mind and to reverse that decision"". She said No 10 was working with universities to help ""boost the capacity available"" in order to ""minimise the amount of students that will be looking to defer."" What's happening with university admissions? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. Scotlandreverted to teacher assessed gradeson 4 August after facing a similar backlash. The move prompted a scramble for university places as students tried to reclaim places at universities which they had last week been rejected from. However, the top universities warned that students who now have higher grades could still be asked to defer if there is no space left on their chosen course. Conversely, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is warning that lower-ranked universities may lose a substantial share of their intake, as candidates seek places on more demanding course. This could be ""financially crippling"", it says. The chaos and uncertainty has led to calls from school and college leaders for an urgent review. The education secretary apologised for the distress caused by the U-turn. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat? FORT SALEM:Fancy some escapism? Binge-watch the new series Call for urgent review into exam results 'fiasco' Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn After the exams U-turn - what happens next?

"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi refused to leave his cell as a court heard emotional testimony from bereaved relatives. Hashem Abedi is due to be sentenced for the murder of 22 people in the 2017 terror attack. At a two-day court hearing, family members of some of those killed have told of the impact of their loss. One bereaved mother told the Old Bailey Abedi's ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"". The 23-year-old worked with his brother to source materials used in the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which injured hundreds at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. During the hearing, parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Others slammed the Abedi brothers, branding them as an ""evil"" pair who launched a cowardly attack on innocent people. 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Lisa Rutherford, whose daughter Chloe was killed at the arena, said the ""horrendous act of cowardice changed our lives forever"", adding that her loss was a ""pain that never leaves us"". It is normal for defendants to be present in court but Abedi - who dismissed his legal team - refused to attend. Judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said he had ""no power to direct that force be used to compel him to come into court"".

Jayne Jones, mother of 14-year-old Nell Jones, said words did not ""come anywhere near"" describing their grief. ""We miss her laughter, her wicked sense of humour. But we cherish her legacy,"" she said. June Tron, the mother of Gateshead plumber Philip Tron, 32, told the court ""my world fell apart"" when she was told he had died and she still suffers nightmares about the bomb going off. ""I felt immense guilt. I just want the trial over. I want justice so I can start to breathe."" Michael Thompson said his family was ""going from day to day on autopilot"" since his daughter Michelle Kiss, 45, had been ""taken from us in the most terrible and cowardly way"". ""We believe there is more good in the world than bad but unfortunately it only takes one bad person to devastate and destroy so many lives,"" he said. Read more:'There is always that empty chair where she should be' In March this year Abedi was found guilty of 22 counts of murder, one count of attempted murder - encompassing injured survivors - and conspiring to cause explosions. Abedi would have been eligible for a whole-life term had he been over the age of 21 at the time of the bombing, the court heard. Mr Justice Baker said it was a ""matter for Parliament who pass legislation which prevents the court of making a whole-life order in the circumstances of this case"". The Old Bailey was told some of the victim impact and witness statements should not be read in open court, but instead be considered by the judge in private.

At least six people were hurt, including three who were in a serious condition In the first incident, the suspect's black Opel car seriously injured a motorcyclist, then drove on targeting two more, eventually ramming the third motorcyclist into the path of his car. The third motorcyclist is reportedly in a life-threatening condition. Pictures of the car and the badly damaged motorbike in front of the bonnet gave an indication of the force of the attack on the motorcyclist, near a busy interchange on the A100 in the Tempelhof area of the German capital. After the crashes, the man was said to have placed a metal box on the road. According to sources quoted by the Tagesspiegel website, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""Nobody come closer or else you'll die."" Named by German media as Samrad A, the suspect lives in refugee accommodation and reports suggest he may have been radicalised there. He is expected to face three charges of attempted murder. Before the attack, the suspect posted pictures of his car on Facebook, along with religious phrases. Public broadcaster ARD reported that the suspect had received psychiatric treatment in the past after making threats to kill but he was not seen as closely linked to militant Islamists. Berlin Christmas market attacker shot dead in Milan The series of accidents on the A100 caused three hours of closures on the motorway on Tuesday, including on the central KurfÃ¼rstendamm. The centre of Berlin was targeted in December 2016, when Islamist militant Anis Amri drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and leaving 49 others injured. Amri fled to the northern Italian city of Milan, where he was shot dead by police. Amri, a Tunisian, had spent several years in jail in Italy.

"Actor Ben Cross, who was best known for playing athlete Harold Abrahams in the film Chariots of Fire, has died at the age of 72. His other roles included the leads in HBO's first ever mini-series, The Far Pavilions, in 1984, and the 1991 horror series Dark Shadows. His representatives said he died ""suddenly"" following a short illness. His daughter Lauren wrote on Facebook that she was ""utterly heartbroken"" that her ""darling father"" had passed away. She said he had been ""sick for a while"" but there had been a ""rapid decline over the past week"". His representatives said he had just finishing shooting horror film The Devil's Light and later this year will appear in a leading role in the romantic drama film Last Letter From Your Lover. He was born Harry Bernard Cross in London to a working-class Catholic family. Ben Cross as British athlete Harold Abrahams in Chariots of Fire After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada), he moved from the stage to screen and took a minor role in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far, which starred Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine. He became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the same year, before gaining wider acclaim as Billy Flynn - the lawyer representing murderer Roxie Hart - in a 1978 version of the stage musical Chicago. It was a performance that was widely believed to have earned him his role in 1981's Chariots Of Fire, which went on to win four Oscars including best picture. Cross played Jewish runner Harold Abrahams in the film, which was based on the true story of two British men racing for Olympic gold in 1924. BBC religion editor Martin Bashir said Cross's portrayal of Abrahams had ""captured the burden of being an outsider"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After Chariots of Fire, Cross was cast as a British officer in 19th Century colonial India in The Far Pavilions, which was described by The New York Times as ""the most expensive, ambitious production ever risked by a pay cable service"". He later appeared as Malagant in the 1995 film First Knight and Sarek in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. Cross also played Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess in the 2006 BBC production Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. James Bond star Colin Salmon, who worked on The Devil's Light alongside Cross, tweeted: ""It was good working with him, seeing his twinkle & his craft. ""He wrote songs for the Sinatra of Bulgaria, had so many stories & spoke in Bulgarian and German on set. Go Well Ben RIP."" US television and film director Todd Holland also shared a tribute, saying he had met Cross early in his own career. ""We shot a screen test at Pinewood Studios. I went to his home for dinner with his family,"" he said. ""Ben Cross was a lovely man and talented actor. That movie never got made. But... what a classy guy."" Cross, who died in Vienna, Austria, had two children, Lauren and Theo.

"Long stretches of motorway driving could become a thing of the past Hands-free driving could be legal on UK roads by spring next year, the government has said, as it launched a consultation on the technology. TheDepartment for Transport (DfT),externalhas issued a call for evidence into automated lane keeping systems (ALKS). Such technology controls a car's movements and can keep it in lane for extended periods, although drivers need to be ready to take back control. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders claims it could cut accidents. The technology for a car to steer itself and stay in lane - even around curves - already exists in some modern cars, but the law says that drivers must remain alert and ready to take over instantly. Tesla's so-called ""Autopilot"" is one well-known example. It is considered ""level two"" on the five defined levels of self-driving cars. The next step - level three - would not need the driver's attention at all times, and in theory, the driver could do other things such as check email or even watch a movie - until the car prompts them to take over again. Introducing those systems would require changes to current legal framework, something the DfT says it is now considering. ALKS technology has been approved by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), of which the UK is a member. It set rules to allow the system in motorway traffic jams, at speeds of up to 37mph (60 km/h). But the technology could be given the go ahead for speeds of up to 70mph in the UK, according to the DfT, potentially making long stretches of tedious motorway driving a thing of the past. The UK government wants to hear from voices within the motoring industry to decide how to safely implement the technology, with the consultation closing on 27 October. The call for evidence will also look at whether ALKS-enabled cars should be classed as automated, meaning the technology provider rather than the driver would be responsible for safety while the system is engaged. Transport Minister Rachel Maclean said: ""Automated technology could make driving safer, smoother and easier for motorists, and the UK should be the first country to see these benefits, attracting manufacturers to develop and test new technologies."" Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said automated technologies would be ""life-changing"" and could prevent 47,000 serious accidents in the next 10 years. The AA's president, Edmund King, has welcomed the move, saying the UK is right to look into measures which could potentially make roads safer. However, there have been a number of incidents involving the current driver-assist feature in which drivers did not pay enough attention to the road. In 2018,a Nottingham resident was banned from drivingafter climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway, letting it do the driving. A fatal crash in the United States was caused, in part, by the driverplaying a video game while leaving his car in ""Autopilot"" mode, before it drove into a concrete barrier. Such cases have caused some to question the marketing of these features as ""self driving"", and whether that is misleading to customers.

"Joe Exotic is currently serving a 22 year jail sentence The exotic cat zoo made famous by the Netflix series Tiger King is closing for good. Current owner Jeff Lowe announced the decision ina Facebook post,external, blaming ""the pressures of"" animal rights charity Peta. It comes after a federal judge ordered the zoo behanded over toCarole Baskin as part of a ruling in a $1m (Â£800,000) trademark dispute. That meant the current operators had to be out in 120 days. Jeff Lowe is the former business partner of Joe Exotic, who is currently serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse. ""The Tiger King phenomenon has definitely changed our lives in many ways,"" he said in his post. ""It has brought us more attention than any human deserves, good and bad. ""It has, and probably will continue to make us a target of every nutjob and animal rights loon in the world, but we are prepared."" Jeff Lowe added that he has voluntarily forfeited his United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor's license - which allowed him to buy and sell animals - due to the park's permanent closure.

He said that after ""five consecutive perfect inspections"", the USDA have now ""folded to the pressures of Peta and continue to make false accusations against me"". ""Suspiciously, less than 24 hours after I contacted the USDA to voluntarily forfeit my license, they notify me that they are suspending my license for 21 days for a litany of falsehoods."" Brittany Peet, who works on the captive animal team at Peta, called for Jeff Lowe's license to be permanently removed. ""Peta looks forward to seeing every one of the long-suffering animals at the G.W. Zoo be transferred to an appropriate facility where it won't take federal intervention for a sick cat to receive veterinary care,"" she said in a statement. Joe Exotic's rival Carole Baskin Tiger King, which became a huge hit on Netflix right at the start of lockdown, tells of Joe Exotic's colourful life and his rivalry with Carole Baskin, the owner of an animal sanctuary in Florida. ""It has also provided us with an unfathomable source of income,"" said Jeff. The streaming service has reportedly secured the rights to a second season - but the show's popularity means there are already lots of spin-offs on the way, including  Nicolas Cagestarring as Joe Exotic in an eight-part series. Jeff Lowe added that his ""new park"" will be a ""private film set for Tiger King related television content for cable and streaming services"". Carole Baskin herself hasn't been far from the headlines since the series came out. Earlier this month it was revealed she isfacing a lawsuitfrom the family of her ex-husband Don Lewis, who disappeared in 1997 and is presumed dead. There are a number of theories over what happened to him, including suggestions Carole was responsible after receiving most of his Â£4.5m estate - something she has always strongly denied. The series brought those theories to a wide audience, and immediately after its release Carole saidthe show had ""no regard for the truth"". She said it ""has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don 21 years ago. ""The series presents this without any regard for the truth or in most cases even giving me an opportunity before publication to rebut the absurd claims. ""They did not care about truth.

"This video can not be played Jill Biden: Joe will ""keep the promise of America"" Joe Biden has been officially anointed the Democratic presidential candidate at the party's convention, helped over the line with some glowing testimonials from elder statesmen. Two Democratic former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, endorsed Mr Biden. Mr Clinton said President Donald Trump had brought ""chaos"" to the Oval Office. Mr Trump trails Mr Biden in opinion polls ahead of November's election. Mr Biden, the former vice-president under President Barack Obama, became his party's nominee on Tuesday night in a pre-recorded roll call vote from delegates in all 50 states. This is Mr Biden's third White House bid, having formerly run in 1988 and 2008. The 77-year-old's campaign appeared to be in danger of collapse back in February this year. On the second night of the party convention on Tuesday, with the theme ""leadership matters,"" Mr Clinton delivered the key address. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career ""Donald Trump says we're leading the world,"" Mr Clinton said in his five-minute message pre-recorded from his home in Chappaqua, New York. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple. ""At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command centre. Instead, it's a storm centre. There's only chaos."" The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do How is Trump doing in the polls? Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? Following addresses from former First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday, Tuesday's speeches aimed to persuade voters the Democratic party is the best suited to repair problems at home and abroad. Mr Powell said Mr Biden shared ""the values I learned growing up in the south Bronx and serving in uniform"". This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? The decorated four-star general said he supported him for president because ""we need to restore those values to the White House"". In June, Mr Powell - who served under President George W Bush and has appeared at multiple Republican conventions in previous years - called President Trump a liar and endorsed Mr Biden. He joins several Republicans who have endorsed Mr Biden, including former Ohio Governor John Kasich during the first night of the convention. What to watch for on day three of Democratic convention Cindy McCain, the widow of Republican Senator John McCain, also spoke about the friendship between her late husband and Mr Biden, though she stopped short of a formal endorsement. Former Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the convention virtually to assail Mr Trump's leadership. ""When this president goes overseas, it isn't a goodwill mission, it's a blooper reel,"" he said. ""He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? The freshly minted Democratic nominee's wife, Jill Biden, potentially the next US first lady, delivered the night's headline address, standing in an empty classroom at the Delaware high school where she taught English in the 1990s. Urging everyone to vote for her husband, who joined her, she said: ""The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. ""I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole."" The convention is largely virtual, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it is unclear whether a format of pre-recorded speeches and no live audience will generate the same levels of enthusiasm as the traditional party gatherings. Next week's Republican convention will also be mostly online. The opening night drew 28% fewer viewers than in 2016,according to ratings from Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company.,externalDemocrats said an additional 10m watched online, which if confirmed would put its audience at slightly above levels that year. Jill Biden's speech wasn't as polished as Michelle Obama's, but it had a raw emotion of its own. She stood in an empty classroom and spoke of students in the autumn whose learning would be confined to boxes on a computer screen, not bustling schools. She talked about the fears - economic and health-related - created by the coronavirus pandemic. The evening began with a keynote address delivered by a rotating collection of up-and-coming Democratic politicians. It was a format that only works in a virtual convention, but as a joint affair, it's unlikely to be the kind of launching pad enjoyed by keynote speakers from previous conventions including Mario Cuomo, Julian Castro and, most notably, Barack Obama. As on Monday night, there was once again a concerted effort to reach out to disaffected Republicans by using members of their party - this time, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Cindy McCain, wife of former Senator John McCain. Meanwhile, younger Democrats often billed as rising stars within the party, such as former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, were given a few moments in the spotlight on Tuesday. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the so-called progressive wing of the party. She seconded the nomination of fellow left-winger Vermont Senator Sanders for president, although this was a routine procedural motion. She did not mention Mr Biden in her speech, but later tweeted her ""deepest congratulations"", adding ""let's go win in November"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez also expressed anger at a US media tweet that said she had not endorsed Mr Biden, calling it ""malicious and misleading"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the progressive wing Mr Trump is continuing to paint Mr Biden as a puppet of left-wing radicals. Earlier on Tuesday, the president was in Arizona, his latest stop on a week-long campaign tour of key battleground states. Most polls show Mr Biden in the lead thus far, though Mr Trump has tightened the margin in recent weeks and the election is still months away. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention: What you missed on day one The Democratic convention, originally planned for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will continue on Wednesday and Thursday, with speeches from vice-presidential pick Senator Kamala Harris, the party's 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Obama. The four nights will end with an acceptance speech from Mr Biden. At next week's Republican convention, Mr Trump will give his acceptance speech from the White House, brushing aside accusations that in doing so he is politicising the presidential seat of power.

"This video can not be played The mutinying soldiers were cheered by crowds as they reached the capital Bamako on Tuesday Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta has resigned, after being detained by soldiers on Tuesday. In a televised address he said he was also dissolving the government and parliament, adding: ""I want no blood to be spilled to keep me in power."" He and PM Boubou CissÃ© were taken to a military camp near the capital Bamako, drawing international condemnation. A spokesman for the soldiers called for ""a civil political transition leading to credible general elections"". Live updates: Mali military makes fresh elections promise A quick guide to Mali Are coups on the rise in Africa? Mr KeÃ¯ta won a second term in elections in 2018, but there has been anger over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and a dispute over legislative elections. It has prompted several large protests in recent months. There has also been anger among troops about pay and over a continuing conflict with jihadists. Wearing a surgical mask amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mr KeÃ¯ta resigned in a brief address on state television. ""If today, certain elements of our armed forces want this to end through their intervention, do I really have a choice?"" he asked. ""I hold no hatred towards anyone, my love of my country does not allow me to,"" he added. ""May God save us."" A televised statement was read out early on Wednesday on behalf of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People. Air force deputy chief of staff Col-Major IsmaÃ«l WaguÃ© said: ""Civil society and political social movements are invited to join us to create together the best conditions for a civil political transition leading to credible general elections for the exercise of democracy through a roadmap that will lay the foundations for a new Mali."" Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta won a second term in 2018 He added: ""As of today, all air and land borders are closed until further notice. A curfew is in place from 09:00 to 17:00 until further notice."" Flanked by soldiers, Col WaguÃ© said: ""Our country is sinking into chaos, anarchy and insecurity mostly due to the fault of the people who are in charge of its destiny,"" It remains unclear who began the mutiny, how many soldiers took part or who will now take charge. It appears to have started when mutinying soldiers took control of the Kati camp, where the president and PM were later taken. BBC Afrique's Abdoul Ba in Bamako says it seems to have been led by Col Malick Diaw - deputy head of the Kati camp - and another commander, Gen Sadio Camara. Who is behind Mali's coup? After taking over the camp, about 15km (nine miles) from Bamako, the mutineers marched on the capital, where they were cheered by crowds who had gathered to demand Mr KeÃ¯ta's resignation. On Tuesday afternoon they stormed his residence and arrested the president and his prime minister - who were both there. The president's son, the speaker of the National Assembly, the foreign and finance ministers were reported to be among the other officials detained. Kati camp was the focus of a mutiny in 2012, also by mid-ranking soldiers, who were angry at the inability of the senior commanders to stop jihadists and Tuareg rebels taking control of northern Mali. When news first broke of the mutiny, the United Nations and African Union both called for the release of those held by the soldiers. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional body, also said its 15 member states had agreed to close their borders with Mali, suspend all financial flows to the country, and eject Mali from all Ecowas decision-making bodies. In recent months, Ecowas has been trying to mediate between Mr KeÃ¯ta's government and opposition groups. The UN Security Council is to meet on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in Mali. Mali's former colonial ruler, France, was also quick to condemn the president's detention, and Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian urged the soldiers to return to barracks. Mali is a key base for French troops fighting Islamist insurgents across the Sahel region. A member of Mali's opposition M5 movement, which has held protests against Mr KeÃ¯ta for the past few weeks, welcomed his resignation. Prof Ramata Sissoko Cisse told the BBC World Service: ""I think it's a relief for the Malian people and for all the citizens of Mali to finally hear from the president that because of the lack of support of the Malian people he finally accepts to resign, to give back power to the people."" M5 is led by the conservative Imam, Mahmoud Dicko, who has called for reforms after rejecting concessions from Mr KeÃ¯ta. The popular imam taking on Mali's president The desert regions of northern Mali are home to various militant groups, some of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, which have also spread into neighbouring Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants French troops, working with a regional force known as G5 Sahel, and a 10,000-strong force of UN peacekeepers are based in Mali, trying to tackle the militants. The French troops first intervened in 2013 to prevent an alliance of Islamist and separatist Tuareg fighters, who had taken control of northern Mali, from marching on the capital. The rebels had taken advantage of a security vacuum following the country's previous coup, when mutinous soldiers overthrew his predecessor, Amadou Toumani Toure. Observers are worried that another round of instability in the country could further destabilise the region. Some of the militant groups are also linked to networks smuggling people and drugs into Europe. The popular imam taking on Mali's president.

For many teenagers who are preparing to receive their grades tomorrow, it's a nervous evening. Sixteen-year-old Rijul Das is one of them - he's hoping to become an astrophysicist. He wants to study Maths, Physics, AS Economics and Further Maths - for that, he needs certain results in his GCSE qualifications. After a huge backlash to the way A-level and GCSE grades were determined using a controversial algorithm, teachers' assessments will now be used for all students - apart from where the algorithm gives a higher grade. Rijul still has reservations: ""The results won't be what I could have got if I'd taken exams but it's the best they can do. And if my results are good I'll be happy and I can just chill. ""The teachers know us well so I just have to hope."" We'll be covering GCSE results day live on the BBC News website - do join us. An entire class of primary pupils in Scotland, and their teacher, have been asked to self-isolate after a case of coronavirus. Contact tracers are working to identify close contacts at St Albert's Primary School in Pollokshields on the south side of Glasgow. A council spokeswoman said ""control measures are in place at the school, and there is currently no evidence of transmission within the school itself"". The number of pupils and staff asked to self-isolate has not been confirmed. Staff self-isolating after an outbreak of coronavirus at a sandwich factory in England's East Midlands are now having to use food banks and struggling with rent, a union has claimed. Many of the almost300 workers who tested positive at M&S supplier Greencorein Northampton are members of The Bakers' Union. The union entered a grievance with Greencore on Tuesday as its regional officer George Attwall said its members ""are now in hardship"". Attwall and branch secretary Nicolar Macari said only statutory sick pay was being paid to the vast majority of people self-isolating, and that workers ""are being evicted as a result of not being able to pay rent"" while others ""were forced to use food banks for the first time in their lives"". The union claims it is ""unfair"" workers only get statutory sick pay of Â£95.85 per week while managers are ""enjoying full company sick pay"". Greencore said it will give ""weekly paid colleagues"" a Â£400 bonus ""in recognition of the financial impact"". Read morehere. Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior US disease researcher who has become a household name amid the coronavirus pandemic, has been honoured with his own baseball bobblehead. Fauci threw out the opening pitch on 23 July at Washington DC's Nationals Park. His pitch, which missed home plate by a long way, led to the doctor getting his own baseball card - which quickly became one of top selling collectible cards in US history. The pitch quickly led to jokes, with some Twitter users pointing out that it is ""literally his job to make sure nobody catches anything"". Allow Twitter content?

The algorithm used to downgrade thousands of A-level results in England was ""unlawful"", opposition politicians have claimed. The computer-based model used by Ofqual to standardise results - after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus - breached anti-discrimination legislation as well as laws requiring it to uphold standards, Labour says. The party wants the education secretary to publish the legal advice he was given. Gavin Williamson has backed Ofqual but apologised for the hurt caused to pupils by the chaos.

Florida's governor has ordered all schools to begin in-person learning by the end of August Florida has become the fifth US state to surpass the grim milestone of 10,000 coronavirus deaths. The figure was announced as the state's health department reported 174 additional deaths. Many occured weeks ago, but have only just been confirmed to be coronavirus-related. Florida also reported 4,201 new cases on Wednesday, continuing a two-week downward trend in new infections. The other states to have hit 10,000 deaths are New York, New Jersey, California and Texas. Zoe ThomasUS business reporter Katie Kresek's show was closed in March Violinist Katie Kresek waited for more than a decade to have her own chair in a Broadway orchestra. Last year, she became the co-orchestrator and violinist for the theatre performance of Moulin Rouge! the Musical. Just 10 months after she started, the lights have gone down on her dream. She says she'll be ""heartbroken"" if the show doesn't return after theatres were closed due to the coronavirus crisis. ""It's sad that when it finally happens, it has to be cut short,"" she says. Instead of performing eight shows a week for a live audience, Kresek now records music alone in her bedroom. Her story is a familiar one to other live performers and particularly Broadway's thousands of workers. Earlier we reported that Pope Francis has called for a coronavirus vaccine to be provided to the world's poorest people if one becomes available. His comments came afterAustralia said it had secured access to a promising vaccineand would offer free doses to its entire population of 25 million people. But how close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? While no vaccine has yet been proven to protect the human body against Covid-19, medical researchers around the world are working hard to change that. About 140 potential vaccines are in early development, and dozens are now being tested on people in clinical trials.  Ultimately, billions of doses of several types of Covid-19 vaccines will need to be made to keep the virus at bay. They will have to be manufactured, distributed and administered across the globe. An emergency scheme allowing some low-risk prisoners in England and Wales near the end of their sentence to be released early is to be paused by the government. The initiativewas introduced in Aprilto help free up prison space to prevent the spread of the virus, but will be stopped at the end of August. Ministers initially said that 4,000 inmates would be eligible for
the programme - but only around 200 were freed. The government said the decision would be kept under review.

Fraser Nolan arrived to the Isle of Man after obtaining a travel exemption A 60-year-old woman who was given permission to visit the Isle of Man to take care of her late mother's estate has been jailed for breaking quarantine rules. Fraser Nolan, from Belfast, arrived on the island by ferry from Northern Ireland on Sunday morning and agreed to self-isolate at a vacant family home. But two days later police received an anonymous tip-off that Nolan had left the premises. She later admitted taking a bus to see a locksmith.

Alistair ColemanBBC Anti-disinformation Team School head teachers canât send children for a coronavirus test or have them detained without parental consent, despite viral social media posts claiming this is the case. The Facebook and WhatsApp posts are aimed at âall caring parents out thereâ, and say that schools can take a child to a coronavirus testing centre if they were showing symptoms - and then have officials detain them further without parental access if they test positive. The childrenâs commissioner for Englandhas said this is not the case,external, writing: âIt is not true that public health officers have the power to screen and assess without a parent or carer present. This power can only be exercised in the presence of an individual with responsibility for the childâ. That means a parent, carer or legal guardian must be present should a child need a test for Covid-19. In the event of a positive test, the most likely result would be self-isolation at home, the commissioner says. While powers of detention do exist, they would only be used in extreme cases where there is a flagrant risk to other people, shadow public health minister Alex Norris says.

"The government is ""absolutely looking at"" lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The number of students studying to be doctors is regulated because of the cost and for NHS workforce planning. But after this week's changes to A-level results, universities fear there will not be enough places for all the students with the grades to get in. The body representing universities has called for the cap to be lifted. The number of places to study medicine is the latest issue thrown up by the government's U-turn on Monday to change how exam grades are awarded, following a backlash. The decision to give A-level and GCSE students the grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, means thousands of A-level students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice university offers. A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? How did Gavin Williamson survive exams U-turn? Up to 75,000 new exam certificates to be issued in Scotland Although the cap on overall student numbers has been raised, places at medical schools remain limited because the costs of training doctors far exceeds the fees paid by undergraduates. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, seen by the BBC, Universities UK sought ""urgent assurances"" that he was speaking to the Department for Health about increasing the medical student cap. ""The role of universities in training the medical workforce is essential for all regions and nations of the UK, as clearly shown by our members' response to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" the letter said. It also called more widely for ""significant financial support"" from the government as students are expected to change courses after being awarded higher grades. The body, which represents 137 institutions across the UK, said that while the change to the grading method was the right decision, it would lead to grade inflation meaning universities with lower entry requirements would face a drop in course take-up and as a result require financial help. The letter also asked for clarity on how increased student numbers could be managed alongside social distancing measures and guidance on how to handle a higher number of candidates with the required grades than available places. Asked whether he would consider lifting the cap on medical students, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""We are looking at that. ""Thankfully we've got an expansion in the number of medical places this year, the biggest number of medical places ever, because we're hiring into the NHS, we're growing the NHS and we want to make sure the NHS has the doctors it needs in the future,"" he added. ""But I am absolutely looking at this issue, yes."" He later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""But of course there's now a huge number of pupils who have the grades, and so we're working very much immediately on how we can go further than we already are."" There have beenplanned increases in the number of medical school placesavailable at English universities in recent years. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Prof Jenny Higham, principal of medical school St George's, University of London, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""Medicine is both a very practical discipline and also requires a great deal of clinical and practical experience and hence clinical placement capacity also needs to be increased."" The pandemic has meant the current students have been unable to carry out their clinical studies meaning there is a backlog in places, she said. Prof Higham added it was a high cost subject with courses funded by supplementary payments from the government as well as tuition fees, and the need to pay for clinical placements. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Conservative MP Sir John Redwood told Newsnight any changes also needed to be fair to the class of 2021 as well as ""make up to the class of 2020"", with next year's cohort needing to be assured of places if they got the necessary grades. On Tuesday, universities minister Michelle Donelan said she wanted to ensure any students who had accepted a ""different course"" than planned, as a result of being downgraded last week, should be able to ""change their mind and to reverse that decision"". She said No 10 was working with universities to help ""boost the capacity available"" in order to ""minimise the amount of students that will be looking to defer."" What's happening with university admissions? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. Scotlandreverted to teacher assessed gradeson 4 August after facing a similar backlash. The move prompted a scramble for university places as students tried to reclaim places at universities which they had last week been rejected from. However, the top universities warned that students who now have higher grades could still be asked to defer if there is no space left on their chosen course. Conversely, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is warning that lower-ranked universities may lose a substantial share of their intake, as candidates seek places on more demanding course. This could be ""financially crippling"", it says. The chaos and uncertainty has led to calls from school and college leaders for an urgent review. The education secretary apologised for the distress caused by the U-turn. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat? FORT SALEM:Fancy some escapism?

"This video can not be played Jill Biden: Joe will ""keep the promise of America"" Joe Biden has been officially anointed the Democratic presidential candidate at the party's convention, helped over the line with some glowing testimonials from elder statesmen. Two Democratic former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, endorsed Mr Biden. Mr Clinton said President Donald Trump had brought ""chaos"" to the Oval Office. Mr Trump trails Mr Biden in opinion polls ahead of November's election. Mr Biden, the former vice-president under President Barack Obama, became his party's nominee on Tuesday night in a pre-recorded roll call vote from delegates in all 50 states. This is Mr Biden's third White House bid, having formerly run in 1988 and 2008. The 77-year-old's campaign appeared to be in danger of collapse back in February this year. On the second night of the party convention on Tuesday, with the theme ""leadership matters,"" Mr Clinton delivered the key address. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career ""Donald Trump says we're leading the world,"" Mr Clinton said in his five-minute message pre-recorded from his home in Chappaqua, New York. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple. ""At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command centre. Instead, it's a storm centre. There's only chaos."" The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do How is Trump doing in the polls? Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? Following addresses from former First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday, Tuesday's speeches aimed to persuade voters the Democratic party is the best suited to repair problems at home and abroad. Mr Powell said Mr Biden shared ""the values I learned growing up in the south Bronx and serving in uniform"". This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? The decorated four-star general said he supported him for president because ""we need to restore those values to the White House"". In June, Mr Powell - who served under President George W Bush and has appeared at multiple Republican conventions in previous years - called President Trump a liar and endorsed Mr Biden. He joins several Republicans who have endorsed Mr Biden, including former Ohio Governor John Kasich during the first night of the convention. What to watch for on day three of Democratic convention Cindy McCain, the widow of Republican Senator John McCain, also spoke about the friendship between her late husband and Mr Biden, though she stopped short of a formal endorsement. Former Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the convention virtually to assail Mr Trump's leadership. ""When this president goes overseas, it isn't a goodwill mission, it's a blooper reel,"" he said. ""He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? The freshly minted Democratic nominee's wife, Jill Biden, potentially the next US first lady, delivered the night's headline address, standing in an empty classroom at the Delaware high school where she taught English in the 1990s. Urging everyone to vote for her husband, who joined her, she said: ""The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. ""I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole."" The convention is largely virtual, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it is unclear whether a format of pre-recorded speeches and no live audience will generate the same levels of enthusiasm as the traditional party gatherings. Next week's Republican convention will also be mostly online. The opening night drew 28% fewer viewers than in 2016,according to ratings from Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company.,externalDemocrats said an additional 10m watched online, which if confirmed would put its audience at slightly above levels that year. Jill Biden's speech wasn't as polished as Michelle Obama's, but it had a raw emotion of its own. She stood in an empty classroom and spoke of students in the autumn whose learning would be confined to boxes on a computer screen, not bustling schools. She talked about the fears - economic and health-related - created by the coronavirus pandemic. The evening began with a keynote address delivered by a rotating collection of up-and-coming Democratic politicians. It was a format that only works in a virtual convention, but as a joint affair, it's unlikely to be the kind of launching pad enjoyed by keynote speakers from previous conventions including Mario Cuomo, Julian Castro and, most notably, Barack Obama. As on Monday night, there was once again a concerted effort to reach out to disaffected Republicans by using members of their party - this time, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Cindy McCain, wife of former Senator John McCain. Meanwhile, younger Democrats often billed as rising stars within the party, such as former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, were given a few moments in the spotlight on Tuesday. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the so-called progressive wing of the party. She seconded the nomination of fellow left-winger Vermont Senator Sanders for president, although this was a routine procedural motion. She did not mention Mr Biden in her speech, but later tweeted her ""deepest congratulations"", adding ""let's go win in November"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez also expressed anger at a US media tweet that said she had not endorsed Mr Biden, calling it ""malicious and misleading"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the progressive wing Mr Trump is continuing to paint Mr Biden as a puppet of left-wing radicals. Earlier on Tuesday, the president was in Arizona, his latest stop on a week-long campaign tour of key battleground states. Most polls show Mr Biden in the lead thus far, though Mr Trump has tightened the margin in recent weeks and the election is still months away. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention: What you missed on day one The Democratic convention, originally planned for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will continue on Wednesday and Thursday, with speeches from vice-presidential pick Senator Kamala Harris, the party's 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Obama. The four nights will end with an acceptance speech from Mr Biden. At next week's Republican convention, Mr Trump will give his acceptance speech from the White House, brushing aside accusations that in doing so he is politicising the presidential seat of power.

"The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients. When Covid-19 patients have smell loss it tends to be sudden and severe. And they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely. Another thing that sets them apart is their ""true"" loss of taste. It's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journalRhinology,external. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet. Experts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation. The main symptoms of coronavirus are: high temperature new, continuous cough loss of smell or taste Anyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have aswab test to check if they have the virus,external. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread. Coronavirus: What are the rules? This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Lead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms. Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all. Prof Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: ""There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses. ""This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu."" He said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar. He stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus. The senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added. Coronavirus wiped out my sense of smell Prof Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US. He and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in theEuropean Respiratory Journal,external. They identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling. This enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the ""entry point"" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection. The nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body. Prof Lane said: ""We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body. ""If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.""

"Coronavirus tests are to be carried out on more people in the government's monitoring programme to get a better idea of the spread of the virus. The Office for National Statistics'Infection Survey,externalwill test 150,000 people a fortnight in England by October, up from 28,000 now. The survey is separate from themass testing programme of people with symptoms,externalto diagnose cases. For the survey, a representative sample of the general population is tested. That means it can provide estimates for the true spread of the virus. The diagnostic testing programme, which provides daily totals, largely relies on people with symptoms coming forward. Some people do not display symptoms when they are infected so the daily totals are an underestimate of the amount of infection that is around. As part of the expansion of the programme, data will also be gathered in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted to see more rapid-turnaround testing for the public. Currently most tests that are taken have to be sent off to labs to be processed - and so people often wait a day for the results. But the government is assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of new types of tests that can deliver results on the spot. He said this was a ""huge priority"" for government as it could make it easier to reopen parts of the economy and perhaps reduce the restrictions around quarantining when you come from high-risk areas abroad. But he was unable to give a timeframe for that as the tests have not be proven to work yet. What tests are available? The ONS study helps us to understand whether rising numbers of people testing positive is down to more testing or more virus. It uses a small sample of people to inform the national picture, like tasting soup with a teaspoonful. At the moment, spotting just 10 infections a week, it takes a while before it can tell whether a rise is a spike or just a blip. A bigger spoon means it will spot the national and regional trends faster. That means we're less likely to be caught unawares if the virus comes back with a vengeance in the autumn. But it still won't see many infections in a town or small city, so won't become our main local outbreak detector. Speaking about the ONS survey expansion, he said the monitoring programme was currently the ""single most important tool"" the government had for making policy decisions around coronavirus because it helped it understand how the disease was spreading. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said expanding the ONS survey would allow the government to be ""more accurate and more localised"" in its response. He added that it would help the government with its ""biggest challenge"", which was finding people who were asymptomatic but could still pass the virus on. It tests thousands of people in households representative of the population, whether or not they have coronavirus symptoms. The results help experts estimate the weekly reproduction (R) number and growth rate of the virus - which tells us if new coronavirus infections are rising or shrinking. The survey also provides important information about the socio-demographic characteristics of the people and households who have Covid-19. According to last week's results,coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, with an estimated one in 1,900, or 28,300 people currently infected. At the start of the pilot study, led by the ONS and the University of Oxford in partnership with the Department for Health and Social Care, around 20,000 households were invited to take part, with the aim of achieving data from around 10,000 households. Since the end of May, additional households have been invited to take part in the survey each week (roughly 5,000 a week), with an additional 15,000 households contacted in July. By beefing up the numbers participating, the ONS will be able to assess what is going on in much greater detail. Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, said that the survey would be the biggest of its kind in this country. ""Vigilance is key to containing this pandemic and the extra data on the spread of infections and antibodies at local level will be invaluable to the planning of effective local responses."" Prof Sarah Walker, of Oxford University, who is a co-leader of the survey, added: ""The added numbers will give us an awful lot of information about how this is all going to play out over the next six months. ""The key question is 'can I get it again?' and because we are going back to households and because we will have enough people we can answer that question, not just overall, but by age, gender and ethnicity."" The extended survey should be up and running by October when government experts are expecting there to be surges in infection. People who take part have routine nose or throat swabs to see if they currently have coronavirus. The survey currently has 60,000 people enrolled - not all of them are tested every fortnight. The aim is to increase this to 400,000 people across the entire project in England, and there will be proportionate increases in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

"The career aspirations of many teenagers were delivered a blow last week when 40% of A level results in England were downgraded from teachers' assessments. So why are the career prospects of Gavin Williamson - the education secretary who presided over what even some usually supportive newspapers have described as a ""farce"" or a ""humiliation"" - not in tatters? It's not just some students, teachers and parents who are scratching their heads over this question - but some Conservative MPs too. One of them said to me: ""Any minister who makes children cry is not in a good place."" Another pointed out that he had plenty of time to prepare for how students should be assessed  - exams were cancelled five months ago, on 18 March. Yet Downing Street maintains the prime minister has full confidence in Gavin Williamson. Why? One reason is that he has a ""human shield,"" in the form of England's exam regulator, Ofqual. The case for the Williamson defence is, essentially, that he was asking the right questions of the regulator but was getting the wrong answers. After the exams U-turn - what happens next? Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress How did the A-level algorithm work? It should be said that it was the education secretary himself who decided in March that he did not want to see ""grade inflation"" as a result of teachers' assessments - and that this year's results would have to  be ""moderated"" or ""standardised"". Mr Williamson claims that the principle of ""moderation"" was widely accepted - and that in more normal times there would always be pupils who failed to meet teachers' expectations in real exams. The Department for Education argues that there was also widespread consultation over the criteria Ofqual would deploy when standardising the grades. So the only issue was how that standardisation would be conducted rather than any debate over whether it was right in principle. Alarm bells about the effects of standardisation were loudly rung by the cross-party education committee - under the chairmanship of Conservative MP Rob Halfon - on 11 July. Committee members called for more transparency over the algorithm Ofqual was using to standardise grades - and demanded that it be published immediately to allow for proper scrutiny. The algorithm was not made public until last Thursday. Thecommittee also warned,externalthat Ofqual's model ""does not appear to include any mechanism to identify whether groups such as black and minority ethnic (BAME), free-school-meal-eligible pupils, children looked after, and pupils with special educational needs have been systematically disadvantaged by calculated grades"". Gavin Williamson's allies say he took these concerns seriously. Students in Mr Williamson's constituency stage a protest Schools minister Nick Gibb and education department officials met the senior figures at Ofqual on 16 July and pressed for clarification on how the algorithm would impact pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and from ethnic minority communities. Officials maintain that the correct questions were asked and that they received assurances that those from disadvantaged backgrounds would not be adversely affected. One insider said that the education secretary can probe Ofqual on its methods but can't, of course, design an algorithm himself. But Mr Williamson was aware that the algorithm's use was likely to throw up ""hard cases"" and ""outliers"" -  rather than masses of students - who would not get the grades they deserved. So the education secretary focussed on improving the appeals system and, ultimately, ensuring that it was free to use, officials say. Ofqual have yet to respond to inquiries about the meeting. In its July report, the education committee said: 'We are extremely concerned that pupils will require evidence of bias or discrimination to raise a complaint about their grades. ""It is unrealistic and unfair to put the onus on pupils to have, or to be able to gather, evidence of bias or discrimination. Such a system also favours more affluent pupils and families with resources and knowledge of the system."" There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the ""calculated"" results Education department insiders maintain that Mr Williamson - who went to a comprehensive school - was determined to inject fairness in to the system and create a robust (one of his favourite words) safety net to catch anyone caught out by the system. Indeed, there was still wrangling going on between Ofqual and the department as recently as last weekend over further changes to the process. Ofqual guidance on how to appeal was removed from its website around eight hours after it first appeared. And they say that it became apparent only in the past few days that the appeals system, however ""robust"", could not deal with the potential scale of the problem. Last Tuesday, theScottish government had to perform a U-turn under pressure. An analysis by Ofqual's Scottish  equivalent - the SQA  - showed that pupils from deprived backgrounds were subjected to higher rates of downgrading than those who were better-off. Scottish education secretary John Swinney insisted that the SQA standardisation model was fair - but that he was now moving to teacher assessments because of the ""anguish"" some pupils had experienced. How did John Swinney survive the school results row? Gavin Williamson's allies say that he sought assurances from Ofqual that the problems the Scottish system had highlighted would not affect England - and, once again, he received assurances that this was the case. Only when the results came out on Thursday did the outcome begin to look rather too familiar. Initially, it was assumed there were rather a lot of ""outliers"" and only subsequently was it established that the algorithm itself was flawed. Over the weekend, there was an internal debate at the DfE over whether the algorithm could be improved, or whether teachers' assessments would have to be accepted after all. Neither solution was ideal. What seems to have swung it is that fixing the algorithm would have led to a delay to this week's GCSE's results. This was not something Downing Street wanted to see. I'm told that by the time the education secretary and the prime minister spoke - by phone - on Monday morning, they were, metaphorically at least, ""in the same place"". It would have to be teacher assessments as the least worst option, and the announcement would be made later that day. What is frustrating some Conservative MPs is not the U-turn itself, but the time it took to put into action. Some privately accuse the education secretary of not being robust enough in interrogating Ofqual earlier in the process. Some wonder why offers from the Royal Statistical Society to help with the modelling in April weren't accepted. But what is agitating most of the education secretary's internal critics is that it took nearly a week for the U-turn in Scotland to be repeated in England. John Swinney survived a no confidence vote in the Scottish Parliament They feel Gavin Williamson dug himself in to a hole by denouncing so strongly the actions of the Scottish government, highlighting the ""unfairness"" of taking teachers' predictions solely as the basis for results. This was, arguably, a failure of the education secretary's political antennae. Even if the Ofqual algorithm did not discriminate against the most disadvantaged, it should have been possible, critics maintain, to anticipate that the protests and parades of disappointed students in Scotland would be repeated in England, given that a similar scale of downgrading was to take place. The perception that a government committed to ""levelling up"" the nation was downgrading bright students from underperforming schools was toxic. And some MPs are questioning why,in the Times,external, as recently as Saturday Gavin Williamson was praising what was ""a fair and robust system for the overwhelming majority of students"". And declaring there would be ""no U-turn, no change"". And on Sunday, when internal debates over accepting teachers' assessments and abandoning the option of fixing the algorithm were very active - why was he apparently defending ""the calculated grade overseen by Ofqual"",in the Express newspaper,external. A former minister with a background in education told me that because the education secretary had nailed his colours so firmly to a teetering mast, it was ""inevitable"" that he would have to go. But it seems nothing is inevitable in politics. Boris Johnson himself is not seen as devoid of blame by some of his own MPs. Last Thursday, the prime minister was also defending the ""robust"" system of assessment in England. This video can not be played The PM said last Thursday results were 'robust, good, dependable' As one MP put it, ""the captain of the ship was too hands off"". Indeed - for some - that captain changed direction as though he were on the bridge of an oil tanker, when what was required was the swift launching of the lifeboats. One former Conservative minister said he fully expects Gavin Williamson to be moved in any autumn reshuffle - that he has been given a reprieve by Downing Street, not exoneration. He has to sort out the messy challenge of getting newly upgraded students in to universities then the tricky task of getting pupils in England back to school next month. The partial return prior to the summer wasn't exactly smooth. So if Mr Williamson's performance in those areas falls short, then his current job is not safe in the long term. But there are other reasons why he hasn't received a ministerial P45. This is not an administration which does resignations. Boris Johnson is loyal to those who are loyal and useful to him. Theclamour amongst Conservative backbenchersfor his adviser Dominic Cummings to go over his lockdown trip to Durham subsided as Downing St dug in its heels. Thecontroversy over the Richard Desmond planning decisionhas not cost housing secretary Robert Jenrick his job. And Gavin Williamson has been helpful to Boris Johnson behind the scenes - as he was to Theresa May until he was sacked, and got behind Mr Johnson's leadership bid. A former chief whip, his reputation as a minister may have suffered but not his abilities as a fixer. No 10 may want to retain him inside the tent. But he also has some cover in the current controversy. He U-turned - but so too did the SNP administration in Edinburgh, the Labour-led administration in Cardiff and the power-sharing DUP/Sinn Fein executive in Belfast. As is important in times of personal crisis, he is not alone. The question is whether the exams saga has predominantly dented Mr Williamson's credibility - or that of the entire government.

"There is an ongoing independent investigation into Conservative Party complaints procedures Young Conservative members are calling on the party to reform its complaints process, citing a lack of clarity and transparency. A number have told BBC Wales they have raised these concerns as part of aWelsh Conservative internal review. Young members have expressed frustration at the way the party has dealt withallegations of inappropriate behaviour against Delyn MP Rob Roberts. A Tory party spokesperson said it takes ""any complaint very seriously"". Speaking to BBC Wales, one Welsh Conservative councillor said the party needed to get ""a HR professional in to deal with the complaints procedure in Wales"". ""The process for complaining is especially unclear for members doing voluntary work for the party,"" the councillor said. Conservative Party publishes terms for discrimination review Tory spring conference to be held in Newport Another party member told BBC Wales they ""wouldn't know how to register a complaint or raise a grievance. There's a lack of transparency"". Aden Hallam, 24, has been a Conservative Party member for two years and has volunteered for the party at local and national elections. In June, he started an online campaign to reform the way the party handles complaints against elected representatives. Last year, he made a sexual harassment complaint to the party about a Conservative councillor in England. He claims he received an acknowledgment of his complaint, but then had no response for over a year. ""Since then I haven't received a single email, phone call or letter from the Conservative Party regarding this complaint and it has been over a year now,"" he said. Aden Hallam says it feels like the party does not care Mr Hallam added the councillor then went ""on to have further successes within the party"". ""It was rather upsetting that I'd made a complaint of that nature, which was extremely serious and upsetting to me, to then see the party seemingly take no action against this individual and actually then reward them further down the line. ""It feels like they just didn't believe what had happened but it also feels like they just don't care."" He said he was concerned ""the individual may do this again"". After BBC Wales approached the Conservative Party for comment they said they would get in touch with Mr Hallam. He added: ""All I want from the party is to have a complaints system where people feel like justice is done, where people feel confident that if they are a victim of bullying, harassment, any sort of inappropriate behaviour that the party will make sure it is dealt with in any manner that is appropriate. ""I just feel the party needs to first of all admit there's a problem."" Mr Hallam posted about his own complaint on social media after allegations of inappropriate behaviour against the Conservative MP for Delyn, Rob Roberts, came to light. In July, the Conservative Party said it was investigating Rob Roberts's behaviour after messages seen by BBC Wales showed Mr Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern to ""fool around"" with him. The party says an investigation into the behaviour of Rob Roberts is continuing Mr Roberts also admitted asking out another House of Commons employee, which resulted in them changing jobs. The MP told BBC Wales that he recognised the request to ask the staffer out ""was inappropriate,"" but did not comment on the messages sent to the intern. The Conservative Party confirmed that the investigation into his behaviour was ongoing. It is facing increased scrutiny about its handling of complaints after the prime minister defended a decision not to suspend a Conservative MP and former minister whohas been arrested and bailed on suspicion of rape. Other Conservative Party members in Wales, who wished to remain anonymous, have also raised concerns about the party's complaints process. One member and chair of a local Conservative association in Wales said there needs to be ""a clear structure for who takes responsibility for complaints"". ""Do you deal with the association chair, the area chair, the Welsh board, or central office?"" The member also criticised the party's handling of allegations against Rob Roberts, saying he should ""lose the whip"" and be suspended from the party's group in Westminster. Another told BBC Wales the party should have acted more decisively in suspending Rob Roberts pending an investigation into the allegations against him. ""His actions were wrong, inappropriate, unacceptable and we want something done about it. We've exhausted our powers to complain internallyâ¦ We don't really know what's going on. ""A proportionate response would be to withdraw the whip from him. This doesn't make things safe for young male and female members and activists, it sets the wrong tone."" The chair of a local young Conservative association in England said it took ""months"" of junior party members talking about the allegations against Rob Roberts before the party publicly announced an investigation. ""It was constantly pushed under the rug by the party - and only properly treated as it should be after the media covered it. ""Young workers for the party aren't being listened to when they knock on the door the first time around. ""I wouldn't know who to contact apart from emailing the standard CCHQ email - that's even as a co-chair for a young Conservatives association. The communication and bridge just isn't there."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""We take any complaint very seriously.  We have a Code of Conduct where people can report complaints in confidence. ""If an allegation of criminal wrongdoing is raised, we would advise the individual to contact the police."" There is currently an ongoing independent investigation into the Conservative Party's complaints procedures. In response to the allegations, Rob Roberts told BBC Wales in July that he had invited a parliamentary staff member to dinner. He said: ""My invitation was not accepted and the staff member did not feel comfortable about it. ""I do now recognise that it was inappropriate to have extended the invitation to a member of staff in the first place.

"This video can not be played The mutinying soldiers were cheered by crowds as they reached the capital Bamako on Tuesday Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta has resigned, after being detained by soldiers on Tuesday. In a televised address he said he was also dissolving the government and parliament, adding: ""I want no blood to be spilled to keep me in power."" He and PM Boubou CissÃ© were taken to a military camp near the capital Bamako, drawing international condemnation. A spokesman for the soldiers called for ""a civil political transition leading to credible general elections"". Live updates: Mali military makes fresh elections promise A quick guide to Mali Are coups on the rise in Africa? Mr KeÃ¯ta won a second term in elections in 2018, but there has been anger over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and a dispute over legislative elections. It has prompted several large protests in recent months. There has also been anger among troops about pay and over a continuing conflict with jihadists. Wearing a surgical mask amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mr KeÃ¯ta resigned in a brief address on state television. ""If today, certain elements of our armed forces want this to end through their intervention, do I really have a choice?"" he asked. ""I hold no hatred towards anyone, my love of my country does not allow me to,"" he added. ""May God save us."" A televised statement was read out early on Wednesday on behalf of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People. Air force deputy chief of staff Col-Major IsmaÃ«l WaguÃ© said: ""Civil society and political social movements are invited to join us to create together the best conditions for a civil political transition leading to credible general elections for the exercise of democracy through a roadmap that will lay the foundations for a new Mali."" Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta won a second term in 2018 He added: ""As of today, all air and land borders are closed until further notice. A curfew is in place from 09:00 to 17:00 until further notice."" Flanked by soldiers, Col WaguÃ© said: ""Our country is sinking into chaos, anarchy and insecurity mostly due to the fault of the people who are in charge of its destiny,"" It remains unclear who began the mutiny, how many soldiers took part or who will now take charge. It appears to have started when mutinying soldiers took control of the Kati camp, where the president and PM were later taken. BBC Afrique's Abdoul Ba in Bamako says it seems to have been led by Col Malick Diaw - deputy head of the Kati camp - and another commander, Gen Sadio Camara. Who is behind Mali's coup? After taking over the camp, about 15km (nine miles) from Bamako, the mutineers marched on the capital, where they were cheered by crowds who had gathered to demand Mr KeÃ¯ta's resignation. On Tuesday afternoon they stormed his residence and arrested the president and his prime minister - who were both there. The president's son, the speaker of the National Assembly, the foreign and finance ministers were reported to be among the other officials detained. Kati camp was the focus of a mutiny in 2012, also by mid-ranking soldiers, who were angry at the inability of the senior commanders to stop jihadists and Tuareg rebels taking control of northern Mali. When news first broke of the mutiny, the United Nations and African Union both called for the release of those held by the soldiers. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional body, also said its 15 member states had agreed to close their borders with Mali, suspend all financial flows to the country, and eject Mali from all Ecowas decision-making bodies. In recent months, Ecowas has been trying to mediate between Mr KeÃ¯ta's government and opposition groups. The UN Security Council is to meet on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in Mali. Mali's former colonial ruler, France, was also quick to condemn the president's detention, and Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian urged the soldiers to return to barracks. Mali is a key base for French troops fighting Islamist insurgents across the Sahel region. A member of Mali's opposition M5 movement, which has held protests against Mr KeÃ¯ta for the past few weeks, welcomed his resignation. Prof Ramata Sissoko Cisse told the BBC World Service: ""I think it's a relief for the Malian people and for all the citizens of Mali to finally hear from the president that because of the lack of support of the Malian people he finally accepts to resign, to give back power to the people."" M5 is led by the conservative Imam, Mahmoud Dicko, who has called for reforms after rejecting concessions from Mr KeÃ¯ta. The popular imam taking on Mali's president The desert regions of northern Mali are home to various militant groups, some of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, which have also spread into neighbouring Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants French troops, working with a regional force known as G5 Sahel, and a 10,000-strong force of UN peacekeepers are based in Mali, trying to tackle the militants. The French troops first intervened in 2013 to prevent an alliance of Islamist and separatist Tuareg fighters, who had taken control of northern Mali, from marching on the capital. The rebels had taken advantage of a security vacuum following the country's previous coup, when mutinous soldiers overthrew his predecessor, Amadou Toumani Toure. Observers are worried that another round of instability in the country could further destabilise the region. Some of the militant groups are also linked to networks smuggling people and drugs into Europe. The popular imam taking on Mali's president.

"Basildon University Hospital in Essex has been told its maternity services were inadequate after a whistleblower's fears sparked a surprise inspection A hospital has been ordered to carry out urgent improvements to its maternity unit after a whistleblower voiced fears about patient safety. The Care Quality Commission (CQC)rated,externalthe unit at Basildon University Hospital as inadequate with ""failings"" found in six serious cases. The CQC said lessons were not learnt from an inspection following the death of mother Gabriela Pintilie last year. The hospital said it was ""focused"" on improving. The unit was criticised following the deaths ofbaby Ennis Pecaku in September 2018andMs Pintilie, 36, in February 2019. Gabriela Pintilie died hours after giving birth by C-section to her second child at Basildon University Hospital in 2019 The CQC previously carried out an inspection of the department the month Ms Pintilie died and said the unit, which had once been rated outstanding, required improvement. Inspectors returned for the surprise ""focused"" inspection after being contacted by an anonymous whistleblower. The report found six babies were born in a poor condition and then transferred for cooling therapy, which can be offered for newborn babies with brain injury caused by oxygen shortage during birth. During their visit, inspectors found: High-risk women giving birth in a low-risk area Not enough staff with the right skills and experience ""Dysfunctional"" working between midwives, doctors and consultants, which had an impact on the ""increased number of safety incidents reported"" Concerns over foetal heart monitoring Women being referred to by room numbers instead of their names A ""lack of response by consultants to emergencies"" resulting in delays The CQC also referred to issues relating to the death of Ms Pintilie, who was not named in the report, and said five serious incidents ""identified the same failings of care"". ""This demonstrated there had been a lack of learning from previous incidents and actions put in place were not embedded."" Professor Ted Baker, CQC chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""We have issued a warning notice requiring the trust to make urgent improvements to ensure mothers and babies are safe."" 'Complete system failure' Solicitor Stephanie Prior, who represents the Pintilie family, said the unit was putting people's lives at risk Solicitor and former nurse Stephanie Prior represents Ms Pintilie's family and said ""nothing seems to change"" and a robust system needed to be put in place. ""You would have thought following my client's death that changes would have been made, but you've got a whistleblower in May 2020 raising safety concernsâ¦ again,"" she said. ""In my client's case... he is now left with a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old son he's bringing up on his own. ""There is a complete system failure and there needs to be a complete overhaul of the unit to make sure it's safe because service leaders do not have the skills to run the unit properly."" Hospital trust chief executive Clare Panniker said changes were already under way to its maternity services Ms Panniker, chief executive of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust which runs the hospital, said the serious cases were being investigated independently, Â£1.8m had been invested in staffing and a new clinical director was in post. Nine midwives and two consultants had already started working and 20 more midwives would join in the autumn. She also said its poor workplace culture was ""unacceptable"" and would not be tolerated. ""We've been really focused in the last few months in making the improvements that mean women can be confident to come and have their babies in the maternity department at Basildon and be very safe in the process,"" she said. Lauren Beattie, who lost her son just after he was born, said promises were not kept to closely monitor her next pregnancy, when she miscarried A woman, whose son died shortly after he was born in January after 22 weeks of pregnancy, has been critical of the care she received at Basildon. Lauren Beattie said she was in the hospital for three weeks before his birth. ""Nearly every day I was having doctors come in encouraging me that I needed to terminate the pregnancy, even though there was nothing wrong with him,"" she said. ""We ended up getting the midwife to write down 'Do not offer [advice to terminate] any more'. ""Every time I've had to go up the hospital I've had to explain the whole situation from beginning to end to everyone - there's no communication between anyone. ""With my most recent miscarriage [when she was pregnant again after her son died] I had four scans - one of which I did have a midwife come in for support which was lovely - but I had scans where I was all on my own to receive bad news. There are situations where people need support."" Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert, chair of the independentMid and South Essex Maternity Voices Partnership,externalwhich gathers feedback from patients, said she felt managers were ""committed to turning"" the unit around. Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert, chair of an independent Essex hospitals maternity group, said she felt senior managers were ""committed to turning"" the unit around ""It hasn't stood out from the feedback that Basildon has been a particular concern recently,"" she said. ""[But] it's not a good report and it will be a concern to the women and families using maternity services there. ""I would sayâ¦ your midwifery care will still be of a very high standard and every midwife you see will be committed to the safety of yourself and your baby."" She said the hospital was implementing a new care model where women would be looked after by the same people during pregnancy and labour, which was known to improve ""outcomes for safety and wellbeing"".

"There is an ongoing independent investigation into Conservative Party complaints procedures Young Conservative members are calling on the party to reform its complaints process, citing a lack of clarity and transparency. A number have told BBC Wales they have raised these concerns as part of aWelsh Conservative internal review. Young members have expressed frustration at the way the party has dealt withallegations of inappropriate behaviour against Delyn MP Rob Roberts. A Tory party spokesperson said it takes ""any complaint very seriously"". Speaking to BBC Wales, one Welsh Conservative councillor said the party needed to get ""a HR professional in to deal with the complaints procedure in Wales"". ""The process for complaining is especially unclear for members doing voluntary work for the party,"" the councillor said. Conservative Party publishes terms for discrimination review Tory spring conference to be held in Newport Another party member told BBC Wales they ""wouldn't know how to register a complaint or raise a grievance. There's a lack of transparency"". Aden Hallam, 24, has been a Conservative Party member for two years and has volunteered for the party at local and national elections. In June, he started an online campaign to reform the way the party handles complaints against elected representatives. Last year, he made a sexual harassment complaint to the party about a Conservative councillor in England. He claims he received an acknowledgment of his complaint, but then had no response for over a year. ""Since then I haven't received a single email, phone call or letter from the Conservative Party regarding this complaint and it has been over a year now,"" he said. Aden Hallam says it feels like the party does not care Mr Hallam added the councillor then went ""on to have further successes within the party"". ""It was rather upsetting that I'd made a complaint of that nature, which was extremely serious and upsetting to me, to then see the party seemingly take no action against this individual and actually then reward them further down the line. ""It feels like they just didn't believe what had happened but it also feels like they just don't care."" He said he was concerned ""the individual may do this again"". After BBC Wales approached the Conservative Party for comment they said they would get in touch with Mr Hallam. He added: ""All I want from the party is to have a complaints system where people feel like justice is done, where people feel confident that if they are a victim of bullying, harassment, any sort of inappropriate behaviour that the party will make sure it is dealt with in any manner that is appropriate. ""I just feel the party needs to first of all admit there's a problem."" Mr Hallam posted about his own complaint on social media after allegations of inappropriate behaviour against the Conservative MP for Delyn, Rob Roberts, came to light. In July, the Conservative Party said it was investigating Rob Roberts's behaviour after messages seen by BBC Wales showed Mr Roberts inviting a 21-year-old female intern to ""fool around"" with him. The party says an investigation into the behaviour of Rob Roberts is continuing Mr Roberts also admitted asking out another House of Commons employee, which resulted in them changing jobs. The MP told BBC Wales that he recognised the request to ask the staffer out ""was inappropriate,"" but did not comment on the messages sent to the intern. The Conservative Party confirmed that the investigation into his behaviour was ongoing. It is facing increased scrutiny about its handling of complaints after the prime minister defended a decision not to suspend a Conservative MP and former minister whohas been arrested and bailed on suspicion of rape. Other Conservative Party members in Wales, who wished to remain anonymous, have also raised concerns about the party's complaints process. One member and chair of a local Conservative association in Wales said there needs to be ""a clear structure for who takes responsibility for complaints"". ""Do you deal with the association chair, the area chair, the Welsh board, or central office?"" The member also criticised the party's handling of allegations against Rob Roberts, saying he should ""lose the whip"" and be suspended from the party's group in Westminster. Another told BBC Wales the party should have acted more decisively in suspending Rob Roberts pending an investigation into the allegations against him. ""His actions were wrong, inappropriate, unacceptable and we want something done about it. We've exhausted our powers to complain internallyâ¦ We don't really know what's going on. ""A proportionate response would be to withdraw the whip from him. This doesn't make things safe for young male and female members and activists, it sets the wrong tone."" The chair of a local young Conservative association in England said it took ""months"" of junior party members talking about the allegations against Rob Roberts before the party publicly announced an investigation. ""It was constantly pushed under the rug by the party - and only properly treated as it should be after the media covered it. ""Young workers for the party aren't being listened to when they knock on the door the first time around. ""I wouldn't know who to contact apart from emailing the standard CCHQ email - that's even as a co-chair for a young Conservatives association. The communication and bridge just isn't there."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""We take any complaint very seriously.  We have a Code of Conduct where people can report complaints in confidence. ""If an allegation of criminal wrongdoing is raised, we would advise the individual to contact the police."" There is currently an ongoing independent investigation into the Conservative Party's complaints procedures. In response to the allegations, Rob Roberts told BBC Wales in July that he had invited a parliamentary staff member to dinner. He said: ""My invitation was not accepted and the staff member did not feel comfortable about it. ""I do now recognise that it was inappropriate to have extended the invitation to a member of staff in the first place. ""However, I have found the last few months and the 'coming out' process to have been particularly challenging and the cause of a great deal of mental stress to me.""

"This video can not be played ""I felt unsafe walking down the street,"" says former Cardiff University student A former Cardiff University student is seeking legal advice on how it dealt with a racism complaint. Natasha Chilambo, 25, was one of eight black students to complain when a fellow student wore blackface as ""a stereotypical, hyper-sexualised black man"" in a 2016 play. She felt ""isolated"" and ""paranoid"", one student attempted suicide and another could not attend lectures. The university apologised for the ""pain and upset"" caused. It added ithad held an independent inquiry. Natasha, from Swindon, said she suffered from insomnia and stopped eating in the aftermath of the incident, and eventually had to leave the university and complete her training in London. She was one of eight black medical students in their third year at Cardiff Medical School when the annual Anaphylaxis charity play took place in 2016. Natasha Chilambo has crowdfunded nearly Â£6,000 for legal funds That year, one of the students who took part in the play impersonated the only black lecturer at the university's medical school, by performing blackface and wearing a black sex toy around his waist. The play also included other racist, sexist and homophobic jokes. This led to the eight black medical students in Natasha's year making a confidential complaint to the university in February as a group. They also asked for a public apology. The 31 medical students who took part in the play were immediately suspended from clinical placements after breaching the university's student behaviour expectations, but they were later permitted to return. BBC Wales has spoken to three of the students who complained, who felt the university did not deal with the complaint or support them adequately. One of the three, who has asked to remain anonymous, said the fact eight black students had made a complaint was made public by the university - effectively removing their anonymity in the process. She said: ""People did the maths. Out of 300 medical students in the year only eight were black. People essentially started to hate us. ""I'd stopped going to lectures because I couldn't face meeting or being in a room with so many other people who I knew didn't appreciate [me] or were angered [by me] at standing up for what was right."" She added: ""The university could have done so much more to protect us."" Cardiff University said the letter had originally been shared so those involved could see the full allegations being raised. The university arranged for the students in the play to write letters of apology, but the complainants said these were only available to view at a certain time and place under condition they would not disclose the contents. Cardiff University said there was an ""open invitation"" to read the letters, and that they formed one part of a restorative justice process, which offered support to those who had complained, and engaged everyone involved to ""try and help repair relationships"". A spokesperson for Cardiff University said a ""wide range of support"" was provided which included ""supporting members of the complainant group to move house, change clinical placement locations, access counselling and support"". The university said it recognised it had failed to foresee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students They added: ""What the university does recognise is that it failed to foresee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students and that we were unable to influence or intervene in a manner that was able to prevent the very deep hurt caused by the breakdown in friendships and peer group relationships that we know impacted so heavily on some members of the complainant group."" The three complainants said the way the complaint was dealt with led to a decline in their mental health. Natasha said: ""I couldn't walk down the streets in Cardiff without feeling unsafe, without panicking about who am I going to meet, are they going to be the students in that play? ""I couldn't do that any longer and ended up having to leave the medical school."" She moved to Kings College London to complete her studies. But when Cardiff University tweeted about the death of George Floyd earlier this year stating ""racism and discrimination have no place in our modern society"" it brought it all back. Natasha said: ""I remember thinking, how can you make such a bold declaration around this space when students who are there now and have been in the past have told you for years that they face racism?"" It prompted her to consider legal action over the way her complaint was dealt with in 2016. She has raised nearly Â£6,000 on GoFundMe for legal fees. Natasha said moving on would be the easier option, but that she wants to make things better for black students in the future. She said: ""We have to create a culture where people are held accountable for their actions that are harmful, where there is the space to say 'you caused me harm'. ""We have to create a culture that empowers, encourages and supports people when they say these things are wrong, or otherwise they carry on and that's not good enough."" The university said it conducted an Independent Review Panel to examine how it's responding to institutional and cultural barriers that exist for minority ethnic students and staff. It said the School of Medicine is working with student societies the African Caribbean Medical Association, Cardiff Healthcare International Perspectives and MedSoc to develop a Student Staff Race Equality Task Group. Yemi Sawyerr said she didn't think black students were supported enough But some black students at Cardiff University still say they feel unsupported by the institution, four years after the play. Yemi Sawyerr, from London, has finished her second year at Cardiff Medical School. Yemi, 20, said: ""Given that the university is predominantly white, I don't think that black students are supported enough."" She said in equality and diversity training she was told to explain why racism is wrong if a patient was racist to her. Yemi said: ""I think the onus is on us to deal with it and fight, rather than on the uni."" Earlier this yearstudents at Cardiff School of Dentistry complained to the university of ""racist behaviour and unconscious bias""from some teaching staff, fellow students and patients. The authors claimed black and ethnic minority students have been mocked and subjected to racist language. The university said it had ""learnt many lessons"" following the incident and complaint The university said it accepted there were failings in the handling of the 2016 Anaphylaxis play, and it had ""learnt many lessons"" and had taken action to address issues such as creating a central incident group to ensure a ""consistent approach to complaints of racism"". A spokesman said: ""The vice-chancellor took the unprecedented step of commissioning an independent and expert panel to review issues of racism in the institution. The panel was given complete access to all available information and was supported to interview staff and students. ""The independent report was published and made a series of recommendations which were accepted in full and their implementation was led by a dedicated member of staff reporting to the deputy vice-chancellor. ""The issues of racism raised by the event are taken extremely seriously and at the most senior level of the organisation as we continue to work to ensure a cultural transformation across the university.""

"Basildon University Hospital in Essex has been told its maternity services were inadequate after a whistleblower's fears sparked a surprise inspection A hospital has been ordered to carry out urgent improvements to its maternity unit after a whistleblower voiced fears about patient safety. The Care Quality Commission (CQC)rated,externalthe unit at Basildon University Hospital as inadequate with ""failings"" found in six serious cases. The CQC said lessons were not learnt from an inspection following the death of mother Gabriela Pintilie last year. The hospital said it was ""focused"" on improving. The unit was criticised following the deaths ofbaby Ennis Pecaku in September 2018andMs Pintilie, 36, in February 2019. Gabriela Pintilie died hours after giving birth by C-section to her second child at Basildon University Hospital in 2019 The CQC previously carried out an inspection of the department the month Ms Pintilie died and said the unit, which had once been rated outstanding, required improvement. Inspectors returned for the surprise ""focused"" inspection after being contacted by an anonymous whistleblower. The report found six babies were born in a poor condition and then transferred for cooling therapy, which can be offered for newborn babies with brain injury caused by oxygen shortage during birth. During their visit, inspectors found: High-risk women giving birth in a low-risk area Not enough staff with the right skills and experience ""Dysfunctional"" working between midwives, doctors and consultants, which had an impact on the ""increased number of safety incidents reported"" Concerns over foetal heart monitoring Women being referred to by room numbers instead of their names A ""lack of response by consultants to emergencies"" resulting in delays The CQC also referred to issues relating to the death of Ms Pintilie, who was not named in the report, and said five serious incidents ""identified the same failings of care"". ""This demonstrated there had been a lack of learning from previous incidents and actions put in place were not embedded."" Professor Ted Baker, CQC chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""We have issued a warning notice requiring the trust to make urgent improvements to ensure mothers and babies are safe."" 'Complete system failure' Solicitor Stephanie Prior, who represents the Pintilie family, said the unit was putting people's lives at risk Solicitor and former nurse Stephanie Prior represents Ms Pintilie's family and said ""nothing seems to change"" and a robust system needed to be put in place. ""You would have thought following my client's death that changes would have been made, but you've got a whistleblower in May 2020 raising safety concernsâ¦ again,"" she said. ""In my client's case... he is now left with a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old son he's bringing up on his own. ""There is a complete system failure and there needs to be a complete overhaul of the unit to make sure it's safe because service leaders do not have the skills to run the unit properly."" Hospital trust chief executive Clare Panniker said changes were already under way to its maternity services Ms Panniker, chief executive of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust which runs the hospital, said the serious cases were being investigated independently, Â£1.8m had been invested in staffing and a new clinical director was in post. Nine midwives and two consultants had already started working and 20 more midwives would join in the autumn. She also said its poor workplace culture was ""unacceptable"" and would not be tolerated. ""We've been really focused in the last few months in making the improvements that mean women can be confident to come and have their babies in the maternity department at Basildon and be very safe in the process,"" she said. Lauren Beattie, who lost her son just after he was born, said promises were not kept to closely monitor her next pregnancy, when she miscarried A woman, whose son died shortly after he was born in January after 22 weeks of pregnancy, has been critical of the care she received at Basildon. Lauren Beattie said she was in the hospital for three weeks before his birth. ""Nearly every day I was having doctors come in encouraging me that I needed to terminate the pregnancy, even though there was nothing wrong with him,"" she said. ""We ended up getting the midwife to write down 'Do not offer [advice to terminate] any more'. ""Every time I've had to go up the hospital I've had to explain the whole situation from beginning to end to everyone - there's no communication between anyone. ""With my most recent miscarriage [when she was pregnant again after her son died] I had four scans - one of which I did have a midwife come in for support which was lovely - but I had scans where I was all on my own to receive bad news. There are situations where people need support."" Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert, chair of the independentMid and South Essex Maternity Voices Partnership,externalwhich gathers feedback from patients, said she felt managers were ""committed to turning"" the unit around. Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert, chair of an independent Essex hospitals maternity group, said she felt senior managers were ""committed to turning"" the unit around ""It hasn't stood out from the feedback that Basildon has been a particular concern recently,"" she said. ""[But] it's not a good report and it will be a concern to the women and families using maternity services there. ""I would sayâ¦ your midwifery care will still be of a very high standard and every midwife you see will be committed to the safety of yourself and your baby."" She said the hospital was implementing a new care model where women would be looked after by the same people during pregnancy and labour, which was known to improve ""outcomes for safety and wellbeing"".

"The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients. When Covid-19 patients have smell loss it tends to be sudden and severe. And they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely. Another thing that sets them apart is their ""true"" loss of taste. It's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journalRhinology,external. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet. Experts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation. The main symptoms of coronavirus are: high temperature new, continuous cough loss of smell or taste Anyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have aswab test to check if they have the virus,external. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread. Coronavirus: What are the rules? This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Lead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms. Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all. Prof Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: ""There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses. ""This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu."" He said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar. He stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus. The senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added. Coronavirus wiped out my sense of smell Prof Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US. He and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in theEuropean Respiratory Journal,external. They identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling. This enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the ""entry point"" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection. The nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body. Prof Lane said: ""We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body. ""If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.""

"The government is ""absolutely looking at"" lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The number of students studying to be doctors is regulated because of the cost and for NHS workforce planning. But after this week's changes to A-level results, universities fear there will not be enough places for all the students with the grades to get in. The body representing universities has called for the cap to be lifted. The number of places to study medicine is the latest issue thrown up by the government's U-turn on Monday to change how exam grades are awarded, following a backlash. The decision to give A-level and GCSE students the grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, means thousands of A-level students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice university offers. A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? How did Gavin Williamson survive exams U-turn? Up to 75,000 new exam certificates to be issued in Scotland Although the cap on overall student numbers has been raised, places at medical schools remain limited because the costs of training doctors far exceeds the fees paid by undergraduates. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, seen by the BBC, Universities UK sought ""urgent assurances"" that he was speaking to the Department for Health about increasing the medical student cap. ""The role of universities in training the medical workforce is essential for all regions and nations of the UK, as clearly shown by our members' response to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" the letter said. It also called more widely for ""significant financial support"" from the government as students are expected to change courses after being awarded higher grades. The body, which represents 137 institutions across the UK, said that while the change to the grading method was the right decision, it would lead to grade inflation meaning universities with lower entry requirements would face a drop in course take-up and as a result require financial help. The letter also asked for clarity on how increased student numbers could be managed alongside social distancing measures and guidance on how to handle a higher number of candidates with the required grades than available places. Asked whether he would consider lifting the cap on medical students, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""We are looking at that. ""Thankfully we've got an expansion in the number of medical places this year, the biggest number of medical places ever, because we're hiring into the NHS, we're growing the NHS and we want to make sure the NHS has the doctors it needs in the future,"" he added. ""But I am absolutely looking at this issue, yes."" He later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""But of course there's now a huge number of pupils who have the grades, and so we're working very much immediately on how we can go further than we already are."" There have beenplanned increases in the number of medical school placesavailable at English universities in recent years. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Prof Jenny Higham, principal of medical school St George's, University of London, told the BBC's Newsnight: ""Medicine is both a very practical discipline and also requires a great deal of clinical and practical experience and hence clinical placement capacity also needs to be increased."" The pandemic has meant the current students have been unable to carry out their clinical studies meaning there is a backlog in places, she said. Prof Higham added it was a high cost subject with courses funded by supplementary payments from the government as well as tuition fees, and the need to pay for clinical placements. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Conservative MP Sir John Redwood told Newsnight any changes also needed to be fair to the class of 2021 as well as ""make up to the class of 2020"", with next year's cohort needing to be assured of places if they got the necessary grades. On Tuesday, universities minister Michelle Donelan said she wanted to ensure any students who had accepted a ""different course"" than planned, as a result of being downgraded last week, should be able to ""change their mind and to reverse that decision"". She said No 10 was working with universities to help ""boost the capacity available"" in order to ""minimise the amount of students that will be looking to defer."" What's happening with university admissions? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. Scotlandreverted to teacher assessed gradeson 4 August after facing a similar backlash. The move prompted a scramble for university places as students tried to reclaim places at universities which they had last week been rejected from. However, the top universities warned that students who now have higher grades could still be asked to defer if there is no space left on their chosen course.

"Ali Bongo Ondimba and his father have ruled Gabon for over fifty years. Military coups were a regular occurrence in some parts of Africa in the decades after independence.  Now, after a period of relative democratic stability, there are indications they are on the rise again. The takeover in Gabon is just the latest in a string of coups that have taken place in recent years, and comes just a month after soldiers took control in Niger. There were two in Burkina Faso in 2022 as well as failed coup attempts in Guinea Bissau, The Gambia and the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe. In 2021, there were six coup attempts in Africa, four of them successful. Last year, a senior African Union official, Moussa Faki Mahamat,expressed concern,externalabout ""the resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government"". A coup can be defined as an illegal and overt attempt by the military - or by other civilian officials - to unseat sitting leaders. A study by two US researchers, Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne, has identified over 200 such attempts in Africa since the 1950s.   About half of these have been successful. The army in Zimbabwe intervened against President Mugabe in 2017 but denied it was a coup Sometimes, those taking part in such an intervention deny it's a coup. In 2017 in Zimbabwe, a military takeover brought Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule to and end. But one of the leaders, Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo, appeared on television at the time, flatly denying it was a military takeover. In April 2021 after the death of the Chadian leader, Idriss DÃ©by, the army installed his son as interim president, leading a transitional military council.  His opponents called it a ""dynastic coup"". ""Coup leaders almost invariably deny their action was a coup in an effort to appear legitimate,"" says Jonathan Powell. The overall number of coup attempts in Africa remained fairly consistent at an average of around four a year between 1960 and 2000. Jonathan Powell says this is not surprising, given the instability many countries experienced in the years after independence. ""African countries have had conditions common for coups, like poverty and poor economic performance. When a country has one coup, that's often a harbinger of more coups."" In the years after 2000, there was a noticeable decline in military interventions. It's only in the last couple of years that coups have become more prevalent. In 2020, there was just one coup (in Mali). Then in 2021 five countries experienced military interventions (Chad, Mali, Guinea, Sudan and Niger). In 2022, there were also five attempts, with two - both in Burkina Faso - succeeding. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno succeeded his father as Chadian leader in April 2021 Ndubuisi Christian Ani from the University of KwaZulu-Natal says popular uprisings against long-serving dictators have provided an opportunity for the return of coups in Africa. ""While popular uprisings are legitimate and people-led, success is often determined by the decisions taken by the military,"" he says. Sudan has had the most coups and attempted takeovers amounting to 17 - six of them successful. In 2019, long-serving leader Omar al-Bashir was removed from powerfollowing months of protests. Bashir himself had taken over in a military coup in 1989. Burkina Faso in West Africa, has had the most successful coups, with nine takeovers and one failed coup. Nigeria had a reputation for military coups following independence with eight between January 1966 and the takeover by Gen Sani Abacha in 1993. However, since 1999 transfers of power in Africa's most populous nation have been by democratic election. Burundi's history has been marked by eleven separate coups, mostly driven by the tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi communities. Sierra Leone experienced three coups between 1967 and 1968, and another one in 1971.  Between 1992 and 1997, it experienced five further coup attempts. Ghana has also had its share of military coups, with eight in two decades. The first was in 1966, when Kwame Nkrumah was removed from power, and in the following year there was an unsuccessful attempt by junior army officers. In 2021, the UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said that ""military coups are back,"" adding that ""geo-political divisions are undermining international co-operation and...a sense of impunity is taking hold,"" he said. Overall, Africa has experienced more coups than any other continent.  Of the 18 coups recorded globally since 2017, all but one - Myanmar in 2021 - have been in Africa.

"This video can not be played Jill Biden: Joe will ""keep the promise of America"" Joe Biden has been officially anointed the Democratic presidential candidate at the party's convention, helped over the line with some glowing testimonials from elder statesmen. Two Democratic former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, endorsed Mr Biden. Mr Clinton said President Donald Trump had brought ""chaos"" to the Oval Office. Mr Trump trails Mr Biden in opinion polls ahead of November's election. Mr Biden, the former vice-president under President Barack Obama, became his party's nominee on Tuesday night in a pre-recorded roll call vote from delegates in all 50 states. This is Mr Biden's third White House bid, having formerly run in 1988 and 2008. The 77-year-old's campaign appeared to be in danger of collapse back in February this year. On the second night of the party convention on Tuesday, with the theme ""leadership matters,"" Mr Clinton delivered the key address. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career ""Donald Trump says we're leading the world,"" Mr Clinton said in his five-minute message pre-recorded from his home in Chappaqua, New York. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple. ""At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command centre. Instead, it's a storm centre. There's only chaos."" The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do How is Trump doing in the polls? Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? Following addresses from former First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday, Tuesday's speeches aimed to persuade voters the Democratic party is the best suited to repair problems at home and abroad. Mr Powell said Mr Biden shared ""the values I learned growing up in the south Bronx and serving in uniform"". This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? The decorated four-star general said he supported him for president because ""we need to restore those values to the White House"". In June, Mr Powell - who served under President George W Bush and has appeared at multiple Republican conventions in previous years - called President Trump a liar and endorsed Mr Biden. He joins several Republicans who have endorsed Mr Biden, including former Ohio Governor John Kasich during the first night of the convention. What to watch for on day three of Democratic convention Cindy McCain, the widow of Republican Senator John McCain, also spoke about the friendship between her late husband and Mr Biden, though she stopped short of a formal endorsement. Former Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the convention virtually to assail Mr Trump's leadership. ""When this president goes overseas, it isn't a goodwill mission, it's a blooper reel,"" he said. ""He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? The freshly minted Democratic nominee's wife, Jill Biden, potentially the next US first lady, delivered the night's headline address, standing in an empty classroom at the Delaware high school where she taught English in the 1990s. Urging everyone to vote for her husband, who joined her, she said: ""The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. ""I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole."" The convention is largely virtual, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it is unclear whether a format of pre-recorded speeches and no live audience will generate the same levels of enthusiasm as the traditional party gatherings. Next week's Republican convention will also be mostly online. The opening night drew 28% fewer viewers than in 2016,according to ratings from Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company.,externalDemocrats said an additional 10m watched online, which if confirmed would put its audience at slightly above levels that year. Jill Biden's speech wasn't as polished as Michelle Obama's, but it had a raw emotion of its own. She stood in an empty classroom and spoke of students in the autumn whose learning would be confined to boxes on a computer screen, not bustling schools. She talked about the fears - economic and health-related - created by the coronavirus pandemic. The evening began with a keynote address delivered by a rotating collection of up-and-coming Democratic politicians. It was a format that only works in a virtual convention, but as a joint affair, it's unlikely to be the kind of launching pad enjoyed by keynote speakers from previous conventions including Mario Cuomo, Julian Castro and, most notably, Barack Obama. As on Monday night, there was once again a concerted effort to reach out to disaffected Republicans by using members of their party - this time, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Cindy McCain, wife of former Senator John McCain. Meanwhile, younger Democrats often billed as rising stars within the party, such as former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, were given a few moments in the spotlight on Tuesday. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the so-called progressive wing of the party. She seconded the nomination of fellow left-winger Vermont Senator Sanders for president, although this was a routine procedural motion. She did not mention Mr Biden in her speech, but later tweeted her ""deepest congratulations"", adding ""let's go win in November"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez also expressed anger at a US media tweet that said she had not endorsed Mr Biden, calling it ""malicious and misleading"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her speech to highlight the policies of the progressive wing Mr Trump is continuing to paint Mr Biden as a puppet of left-wing radicals. Earlier on Tuesday, the president was in Arizona, his latest stop on a week-long campaign tour of key battleground states. Most polls show Mr Biden in the lead thus far, though Mr Trump has tightened the margin in recent weeks and the election is still months away. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention: What you missed on day one The Democratic convention, originally planned for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will continue on Wednesday and Thursday, with speeches from vice-presidential pick Senator Kamala Harris, the party's 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Obama. The four nights will end with an acceptance speech from Mr Biden. At next week's Republican convention, Mr Trump will give his acceptance speech from the White House, brushing aside accusations that in doing so he is politicising the presidential seat of power.

"People are being urged to work from home and not use public transport The Republic of Ireland's cabinet has reversed some of its lockdown relaxation measures as it attempts to deal withrising Covid-19 case numbers. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said: ""We are at a tipping point."" He added that a few weeks ago there were just 61 new reported cases for a seven day period but last week there were 533 cases. The tightening of restrictions comes ahead of the reopening of schools over the next two weeks. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said that if the current rates of Covid-19 continue to rise ""it will be impossible to stop the spread of the virus to our most vulnerable and our most compromised"". On Tuesday, a further coronavirus-related death was reported, bringing the Republic of Ireland's total to 1,775. There were 190 more confirmed cases of Covid-19. Crowds attending outdoor events, including sports, are to be reduced from 200 to 15. Indoor gatherings - excluding shops, restaurants and other businesses - are to be restricted to six people. Those aged over 70 are again being asked to stay at home as much as possible. People are also once again being encouraged to work from home and to avoid public transport where possible. Consideration is to be given as to whether GardaÃ­ (Irish police) should get new powers to intervene where they believe social distancing rules are not being complied with. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said there is a risk the virus could spread ""to our most vulnerable and our most compromised"" In an initial response to the measures the leader of Labour party, Alan Kelly, has said the measures send out the wrong signal and will affect morale. The restrictions will remain in place until 13 September at the earliest. Following Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly told a press conference that multiple clusters had emerged in homes and workplaces around the country. Mr Donnelly said the 14-day cumulative cases per 100,000 of population is now 26 and the Republic of Ireland's rate of growth in the past two weeks was the fourth highest in Europe. The number of coronavirus cases rose by 200 on Saturday, although the daily tally on subsequent days was lower. The number reported on Monday was 56, down from 66 on Sunday.
