"This video can not be played Protesters listened to speeches from politicians and activists in Parliament Square Thousands of people gathered in central London to demonstrate against the UK government's economic policies. The protest was organised by a group called the People's Assembly Against Austerity. Demonstrators met outside BBC Broadcasting House in Portland Place, before marching past Downing Street and on to Parliament Square. The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was among the speakers who addressed crowds at The Not One Day More protest. Speaking in Parliament Square, Mr Corbyn said: ""The Tories are in retreat, austerity is in retreat, the economic arguments of austerity are in retreat. ""It's those of social justice, of unity, of people coming together to oppose racism and all those that would divide us, that are the ones that are moving forward."" The crowd chanted ""oh Jeremy Corbyn"" and ""Tories out"" during the rally, while many carried banners saying Justice For Grenfell. One protester told BBC News that ""anger"" had motivated her to join the protest, saying: ""What's going on isn't good enough under the Tory government. ""There have been cuts to every single service you can think of. It's just the pure negligence. How can you be cutting vital services?"" The organisers said on Facebook that they ""invite everyone - from campaigns and community groups across the country, from the trade unions, from political parties and any individual - to come together in one massive show of strength and solidarity"". The statement added: ""We're marching against a government committed to austerity, cuts and privatisation. ""We're marching for a decent health service, education system, housing, jobs and living standards for all."" Downing Street did not want to comment on the protest.

"This video can not be played Norman's daughters: ""He had a great life, a wonderful marriage and an enviable career"" Film critic Barry Norman has died aged 83, his family says. The journalist and former BBC presenter died in his sleep on Friday night. A statement from his daughters, Samantha and Emma, called him ""remarkable"", adding: ""He had a great life, a wonderful marriage and an enviable career."" Norman hosted BBC One's ""Filmâ¦"" show between 1972 and 1998 - its longest running host - as well as writing for the Daily Mail and the Guardian. His literary agent described him as ""the defining voice of film criticism and insightful interviewing of screen legends from both sides of the camera"". Norman's daughters added: ""He leaves behind a family who adore him and a great roster of friends who love him too. We will miss him more than we can say."" Barry Norman hosted ""Film..."" on the BBC between 1972 and 1998. Norman's literary agent, Gordon Wise, said the presenter had been living with lung cancer for a number of years, but that he would be remembered as ""one of the true greats"" of film. ""It was probably that background as a newspaper journalist, interviewer and features writer that all came together to make him such a gifted film critic,"" he told BBC News. ""He could not only appreciate the story of the film but all the talents that had gone into making the film. That is what we all remember from the three decades of the Film programme - that he brought you perspectives from every side of the camera."" Tributes have begun flooding in on Twitter, with plenty of references to Norman's pickled onions - a family recipe handed down from his grandmother that he launched as a range in supermarkets in 2007. Actor and presenter Stephen Frytweeted,externala tribute, writing: ""Sad to hear of Barry Norman's departure. A film critic and a provider of fine pickled onions. That's a good life."" Presenter Jonathan Ross, who took over ""Film..."" in 1999, added to the tributes. Hetweeted,external: ""Very sad to hear that Barry Norman has left us. A great critic and a lovely, lovely man."" And Claudia Winkleman, who started presenting the same show in 2010, called him ""an incredibly kind man and the greatest critic"". Barry Norman was born in London on 21 August 1933 to film director Leslie Norman and his wife, Elizabeth. He went to Highgate School in north London, but skipped university, instead beginning his writing career at the Kensington News. Norman's journalism took him to South Africa to work on two newspapers, but it was when he came back to the UK that his entertainment career took off - becoming showbiz editor at the Daily Mail. It was during his Fleet Street years that he met his wife Diana - a journalist and the author of best-selling thrillers under her pen name Ariana Franklin - and they wed in 1957. The couple had two daughters and were married for more than 50 years, until her death in 2011. Norman became best known as the presenter of the ""Film..."" programme, which he hosted on BBC One for 26 years, before he left the channel to move to Sky. His notoriety was solidified when he became a puppet on Spitting Image, which created a catchphrase for him - ""And why not?"" - that he later adopted himself and which became the title of his autobiography. He also wrote documentaries on the entertainment industry, wrote columns for the Guardian and the Radio Times, and was the first host of BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz - as well as being a presenter on the Today programme. BBC director general Tony Hall described Norman as a ""first-class presenter and critic"". He added: ""Film buffs always found his programmes essential viewing. He dominated broadcasting about films for a generation with wit and great knowledge. He will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with his family and friends."" BBC film critic Mark Kermode described Norman as ""the master"". ""Watching Barry Norman review films was a pleasure, an education, and an inspiration,"" hetweeted,external.

"It is nearly 20 years since William and Harry lost their mother, Diana. Prince William and Prince Harry have attended a private service to rededicate the grave of their mother, Princess of Wales, almost 20 years after her death. The service was held at Diana's family home in Northamptonshire on what would have been her 56th birthday. The ceremony was also attended by the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are in Canada. The service, at Althorp House, was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris, when the Duke of Cambridge was 15 and his brother was 12. By Peter Hunt, royal correspondent, BBC News This is the start of a difficult few months for Prince William and Prince Harry as they remember their mother who, they say, smothered them in love. They were traumatised children when she died. Harry has spoken of how he shouldn't have been madeto walk behind Diana's coffin. William has expressed his considerable regretthat they weren't old enough to do more to protect her. Twenty years on, together, they're taking control of how she will be remembered. They've commissioned a statue.  Its unveiling, in the future, will be public. Today's service was to be very private, with no media present. The princes, like their mother, have a complex relationship with the press. They will never forgive the paparazzi who pursued their mother's car in Paris. Also absent from the graveside was Prince Charles. It's fortuitous he's in Canada and it's probably a relief for all concerned. Read more from Peter Hunt The princes have commissioned a statue of Princess Diana to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.

"The papers report on a growing battle within the cabinet over austerity and public spending The Sunday Telegraph says a new front has opened up in the cabinet battle over austerity. Thepaper says,externalEducation Secretary Justine Greening has told Prime Minister Theresa May the Tories should abandon plans to cut per-pupil funding, with the change in direction being announced soon so that schools know where they stand. According to the paper, senior figures at Number 10 admit they are braced for ""a big battle"" over spending this summer. The Sunday Times reports thatmore than 20 MPs cornered the Conservative chief whip last week,external, demanding change, and more than double that number are threatening to rebel over spending plans unless the 1% public sector pay cap is lifted. University tuition fees are the focus in theMail on Sunday,external, which leads with the suggestion by Mrs May's most senior minister, Damian Green, that a national debate may be needed on the issue. The paper also highlights what it describes as fading public support for austerity policies, but it notes that lifting the pay cap, and linking it to inflation instead, would cost the Treasury an extra Â£1.4bn a year alone. The Sun on Sunday,externalreports that Ms Greening and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are leading the charge for public sector workers to get a pay rise. ""There are very good arguments for continuing to bear down on the deficit,"" a cabinet source tells the paper, ""but the case on public sector pay is becoming irresistible."" According toThe Observer,external, Mr Hunt may press for the lifting of the public sector pay cap for NHS workers, citing a pay review body report that suggests the costs of plugging gaps caused by staff shortages could soon be greater than the savings. It refers to a ""chorus of Tory demands"" facing Mrs May. Writing inThe Sunday Mirror,external, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says nurses and paramedics should not have to wait until the autumn Budget to learn whether the pay cap will be lifted. But The Sunday Times is having none of it. Describing it as""a government in danger of losing its financial wits,"",externalthe paper warns that a Conservative Party that stands for nothing, including fiscal discipline, will flounder. The Telegraph,external, likewise, urges Chancellor Philip Hammond to resist the calls for change, saying the government is in danger of giving up on financial prudence as though it is a television programme we have got bored with. The country as a whole, it says, should have the moral fibre to face the financial reality in front of us. ButThe Observer,externalargues that capping public sector pay has fuelled recruitment and retention problems. It is not just mean, the paper says, it is a false economy. The news that British fishermen are to have the exclusive rights to a 12-mile zone around the coastline leadsThe Sunday Express,external. The paper welcomes it as a first step towards taking control of the country's fishing policy. The new Environment Secretary, Michael Gove,tells The Sunday Times,externalthat his father's fishing business was hit by the EU, and pulling out of the London Fisheries Convention was ""a chance to put things right"". The Sunday Times also has what it calls ""awkward"" scientific findings. Researchers in Rotterdam have apparently found thatmen's average IQ is four points above women's,external- because they typically have bigger brains. The paper describes the finding as the latest twist in a debate with powerful political implications. It notes that in the 19th Century, the view that women's smaller brains made them less intelligent was used to justify denying them rights such as voting. Finally, the day before the start of Wimbledon has brought with it the inevitable exhaustive analysis of Andy Murray's chances. ""It's been brutal but I'm ready,"" is the headline inThe Mirror,external, which describes how a hip injury has wrought havoc with the player's preparations. The Express,externalsays the man who it describes as ""Battler Andy"" has grown into a dignified champion, and it wishes him good luck in defence of his Wimbledon title.

"It's 10 years since smoking was banned in enclosed workplaces in England, following similar moves in the rest of the UK. But how has the ""pub smoking ban"" changed the country? Do you remember the time when pubs were full of smoke? When you could light up after a meal at a restaurant? Or when smokers didn't have to congregate on the street outside offices? The law, which marked a fundamental shift in attitudes towards smoking, is now 10 years old. It banned smoking in all enclosed public places and work places when it came into force in England on 1 July 2007. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales had already taken the plunge over the previous 18 months. Its backers justified it on the basis that smokers were putting others at risk by exposing them to second-hand smoke. But opponents suggested the risks from passive smoking did not justify the attack on smoking. At the time the move was controversial. The health lobby fought for decades to get it introduced and right up until the last minute ministers considered all sorts of exceptions - retaining smoking rooms or allowing certain premises to be exempt. But once introduced, the country soon fell into line. Councils were charged with policing it. In the first 18 months officers inspected nearly 600,000 premises. Few broke the rules. Public backing grew and grew - and remains strong today. A poll of more than 4,000 adults by YouGov released for the 10th anniversary found nearly three-quarters of people would oppose the ban being overturned, with just 12% wanting to get rid of it. But other polling does show opinion is pretty split on whether the complete ban could be modified - such as by the introduction of designated smoking rooms in pubs and clubs. The number of pubs in the UK has been falling.  Between 2007 and 2015, the UK lost nearly 7,000 pubs. Some publicans and other critics say the smoking ban played a large part in this. Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights lobby group Forest, says the impact has been ""devastating"". But there are other factors too. There has been a massive decline in theamount of beer people drink,external. The British Beer and Pub Association cites the rise in the tax applied to drinks - and beer in particular. The beer duty escalator meant that between 2008 and 2013 the duty increased by 42% and this has come at a time when supermarkets have tried to entice shoppers in with discounts on booze. At the same time as the smoking ban came in, the economic crash was about to start. It had a massive impact on incomes in the UK. Average real-terms pay is still belowwhere it was 10 years ago. London's Intrepid Fox pub closed in 2008 and is now a burger restaurant With all these factors happening at the same time, BBPA spokesman Neil Williams says it is ""pretty impossible"" to unpick exactly what the individual impact of the ban has been. And of course, many pubs have thrived since the smoking ban, changing to focus more on high-quality food and trying to attract families - including those with young children - who would previously have avoided smoky atmospheres. ""Pubs have had to adapt. We've seen those that can invest in food and they've made a very good job of it. ""But some pubs - the traditional street-corner boozer - simply haven't had the space to do that. They are the ones that have suffered."" And there's a wider picture. People in the UK seem to be drinking less. The Office for National Statistics says that between 2005 and 2016, the number of people sayingthey had had anything to drink,externalin the previous week fell from 64% to 57%. The numbers drinking on five days or more a week nearly halved over that time. Smoking rates are falling. Today fewer than 17% of people smoke. But as the graph below shows the downward trend goes back decades - and there was actually a slowing of the rate of decline immediately after the ban. Most experts agree that is understandable. As the numbers fall, what you are left with is a more hardcore group of smokers whom it is hard to persuade to give up. But how much of the fall is down to the ban - and how much is down to other factors? There are fewer young people taking up smoking. The numbers have halved since the introduction of the ban. But again it is difficult to work out quite how much of that is down to the 2007 legislation. When you look at drinking rates, drug use or teenage pregnancy numbers, they tell a similar story. There is a clear pattern - the young have changed the way they behave. This consistent trend has not yet been properly explained. One of the few convincing theories centres on social media - the idea is that young people spend so much of their time online that it has replaced other vices. The ban also encouraged some existing smokers to give up. Following its introduction there was a 23% increase in quit attempts made via NHS stop-smoking services. Research suggests the ban was particularly effective at raising awareness about the risks of second-hand smoke - people were motivated to protect those they smoked around, as well as looking after their own health. The YouGov poll also provides some evidence. It found 14% of ex-smokers had been influenced in their decision to quit by the ban, while 20% of current smokers say they smoke less because of it. But you can't ignore the influence of e-cigarettes either. Vaping has offered a healthier, more socially acceptable alternative to smoking. Momentum was just gathering in 2007, but figures from the Office for National Statistics show that today one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes - a quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers. But not every measure shows such positive results. England still has a relatively large number of women who smoke during pregnancy - one in 10 at last count , although the figures are admittedly falling. Policymakers have been so worried about these numbers that they have tried offering financial incentives, such as shopping vouchers, to pregnant women who quit. There also remains a large discrepancy in the income levels between who smokes and who doesn't. Those with the lowest incomes are twice as likely to smoke as people who come from the highest income groups - a gap that refuses to budge even as smoking rates fall. Tackling this discrepancy has been a major focus of health campaigners in recent years. Smoking rates are a significant factor in the differences in life expectancy and health outcomes. Talking of health, how has the ban affected the rates of illness and disease? In the years after the ban there was a flurry of research looking at what impact it had had. The Department of Health commissioned an evidence review that was published in 2011. It highlighted a fall in respiratory illness reported by bar workers immediately after the ban. The review also flagged up research that showed hospital admissions for heart attacks fell by 2.4% immediately following the change in the law. That was the equivalent of 1,200 heart attacks a year. Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar believes the impact on health will continue to be ""huge"" and that the ban should be viewed as one of the most important public health measures of recent history. But truly assessing the impact on health will take some time. Overall hospital admissions and deaths attributable to smoking have been falling in recent years, but only slowly. The fact remains that it takes some time for the impact of lower smoking rates to influence health outcomes. Take lung cancer, for example. About 85% of cases are caused by smoking. But if you look at the number of cases being diagnosed, the figures for men and women were going in the opposite direction until 2012. The rising rates in women seen after 2007 are not, of course, because the ban had opposite effects on men and women. Instead it is to do with what was happening half a century ago, because of the long lag between smoking and cancer developing. It was not until the mid 1960s that the numbers of women smoking eventually peaked. For men that happened at the end of World War Two, hence lung cancer cases have been falling for over 20 years in men. Smoking peaked among women in the mid-1960s But one thing we can see clearly 10 years on is how the global appetite for anti-smoking legislation has grown. While the UK took its time in introducing the ban, since then ministers have proved to be more decisive. When the legislation was introduced, England was following the herd. The Republic of Ireland was the first country to introduce a complete ban in 2004. A host of other countries from the US and Canada to Australia had taken their own steps too by 2007. But others have quickly followed suit and now smoking bans - whether full or partial - are commonplace as this chart (which is by no means exhaustive) shows. Over the past decade there has been a flurry of new legislation - and the UK has often been at the forefront. The age at which people can buy tobacco products has been raised from 16 to 18 and they are no longer stocked in vending machines. Bans of tobacco displays in shops have also been introduced, while cigarettes now have to be sold in standardised packages and smoking is not allowed in cars carrying children. Locally, a number of town halls have also sought to take their own steps, with some looking at bans in parks, squares and outside areas used by restaurants and pubs. The ban, it seems, has opened the floodgates.

"This video can not be played Canada celebrates its diversity and heritage on its 150-year anniversary Revellers, police and some protesters converged on Canada's national capital on Saturday for a party that has been years in the planning. Canada marked its 150th anniversary as a country in towns, cities and at backyard barbecues nationwide. But the biggest bash was at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where thousands of people joined the celebrations. Large crowds turned out in their droves - albeit huddled under umbrellas, trying to avoid the rain. Some partygoers, like 24-year-old students Morgan Haines, Jon Salamati and Nima Sahebi, got to the hill before the sun had even risen. Their early morning netted them a prime spot right next to the main stage, where they said they planned to stay until after the fireworks at midnight. Fireworks over Ottawa's Parliament Hill concluded the day's celebrations There was also a fireworks display alongside Toronto's landmark CN Tower The three travelled from Vancouver, on Canada's west coast, to celebrate the day in the capital. ""One-fifty is only going to happen once,"" Mr Salamati said. ""By the time we hit Canada 200, we might not be able to do this trip."" Clara Swain attended the East York Toronto Canada Day parade with a flag painted on her face People took to the streets in large numbers in Toronto to mark the country's 150th anniversary The celebrations included a concert by Canadian artists, a display from Canada's aerobatics squadron the Snowbirds, a citizenship ceremony for new Canadians, and a massive fireworks display. Canadian theatre giants Cirque du Soleil performed, and Bono and The Edge from the rock band U2 serenaded the crowd with an acoustic set. In pictures: Canada 150 celebrations Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made inclusiveness a political calling card, gave a speech celebrating that attribute. ""We don't care where you're from or what religion you practise, or whom you love - you are all welcome in Canada,"" he said to cheers from the crowd. Mr Trudeau's speech was delivered in both English and French, a tradition in Canada, which recognises both as its official languages. ""This is as good a reason as any to reflect on our past, to cheer on today, and to recommit ourselves to the future,"" he said to the 25,000 partygoers who had waited hours to get past security and on to the parliament's lawn. The weather did not deter these people in Ottawa But he also took a moment to remember Canada's indigenous people, whom he said had been ""the victims of oppression"" since the first settlers arrived. ""As a society, we must acknowledge past mistakes,"" he said, telling the audience that there was still much work to be done in order to achieve reconciliation. However, Canada, he said, was determined to see a reconciliation over the coming years and decades. ""It is a choice we make not because of what we did, or who we were, but because of who we are,"" Mr Trudeau said. Why the world suddenly loves Canada What does it mean to be Canadian today? What's in store for Canada's next 150 years? Indigenous culture was represented in many ways across the festivities, with a number of indigenous performers participating in Canada Day concerts in the capital region. But some indigenous peoples refused to recognise Canada 150, saying it represented more than a hundred years of colonisation. Sandwiched between security fences and to the west of the main stage on the parliament's lawn, a group of indigenous protesters set up a teepee. They were allowed to stay on Parliament Hill after erecting the structure in the early hours of Thursday morning in what organisers called a ""reoccupation"".

Jess Bolduc, from the Anishinaabe First Nation, said she hoped the day would be one of ""conversation and dialogue"" when Canada Day revellers flood the lawn. ""In celebrating Canada 150, we're celebrating a half-truth,"" she said. ""We need to be thinking about the tens of thousands of years indigenous people have been, and continue to be, here."" Prince Charles was in Canada helping to mark the occasion Across the Ottawa river in Gatineau, Quebec, crowds also lined up to see Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall open a new hall at Canada's Museum of History. Prince Charles' mother, the Queen, is Canada's head of state. Rumela Kabir Booth, from an Indian dance school in Ottawa, helped entertain the crowd before their arrival. ""Canada is such a multicultural and inclusive society,"" she said. ""It's great to highlight all the different cultures and aspects that come together.""

"The oil tanker Seafrontier suffered significant damage An oil tanker and a cargo ship have collided in the English Channel. The collision happened 15 miles north east of Dover at 02:00 BST, the coastguard said. The 183m (600ft) tanker Seafrontier, which is loaded with petrol, has a hole above the waterline and damage to the superstructure, the RNLI said. The 225m (740ft) Huayang Endeavour was also damaged. None of the crew on board either ship was injured. ""Although both vessels have been damaged, there is no water ingress and no pollution,"" a coastguard spokesman said. Huayang Endeavour was en route to Lagos in Nigeria and Seafrontier was travelling to Puerto Barrios in Guatemala. The vessels have Chinese and Indian crews on board, the UK coastguard said. The Huayang Endeavour was on its way to Nigeria when the collision happened The Seafrontier was damaged above the waterline, the RNLI said A tug from Boulogne was called and the Seafrontier was taken under tow. The Huayang Endeavour is anchored mid-Channel between the two shipping lanes. Both ships are registered in Hong Kong.

"Supporters of Grenfell survivors took part in anti-government protests in central London on Saturday The government will keep ""a close eye"" on Kensington and Chelsea council after its leader quit over the Grenfell Tower fire, the communities secretary says. Sajid Javid said it was ""right"" that Nicholas Paget-Brown stepped down and said the process to select a successor would be ""independent of government"". London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for commissioners to take over the council. Earlier, a victims' group said one resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the fire. At least 80 people are believed to have died as fire engulfed the Grenfell Tower block, in west London, on 14 June. Mr Javid said: ""It is right the council leader stepped down given the initial response to the Grenfell tragedy,"" adding: ""If we need to take further action, we won't hesitate to do so."" Cladding 'changed to cheaper version' How flammable cladding gets approved What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Evacuated family 'still have nowhere to go' Mr Paget-Brownresigned following sustained criticism of the counciland an aborted meeting of its cabinet on Thursday, from which leaders had tried to ban members of the public and press. The council is due to elect a leader next week. Yvette Williams, co-ordinator of the Justice4Grenfell campaign, said one former Grenfell Tower resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the tragedy. The survivor, who is housed in a hotel, got her bank card back and only realised that the rent had been taken when she went to withdraw funds from a cash point, Ms Williams said. ""It's just disgusting,"" she added. Kensington and Chelsea council said to the best of its knowledge rent charges for Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk had been stopped. ""We are very sorry if this has happened and we are working to find out who has been affected so we can offer reassurance and an immediate refund,"" a council statement said. ""But if anyone has had money inadvertently taken as part of a direct debit or standing order we will make arrangements to have it immediately refunded."" Catherine Faulks, Conservative councillor for Kensington and Chelsea council, told the BBC: ""It obviously is a mistake and I'm sorry that that has happened."" She said they would try to put it right. Supporters of the Grenfell survivorsjoined anti-government protests through central Londonon Saturday, calling for an end to austerity measures. Residents condemned the response to the tragedy, calling it ""absolute chaos"" as relief efforts on the ground were limited. They said there was little or no co-ordination in the immediate days after the disaster, with claims council officials were nowhere to be seen. The council was accused of failing to provide enough support or information to those who had been made homeless. It tried to hold the first cabinet meeting since the disaster behind closed doors. After a High Court order ruled it should be open to the public, the council adjourned the meeting after 20 minutes, claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the inquiry. Council leaders claimed on Thursday that an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry into the disaster. But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a ""fiasco"". This video can not be played Nick Paget-Brown: ""I have to accept my share of responsibility"" In his resignation statement, Mr Paget-Brown said he had received legal advice not to ""compromise"" the public inquiry into the fire by having the meeting open to the public and press. But he added this decision ""has itself become a political story"". ""It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or still unaccounted for,"" he said. Six questions for the investigation A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Reacting to Mr Paget-Brown's resignation, Mr Khan said it had been ""clear that the local community in and around North Kensington has lost trust in the council and that the administration is not fit for purpose"". He had earlier called on the prime minister to appoint ""untainted"" commissioners with ""a genuine empathy for local people and the situation they face"" to take over the running of the council until the next local council elections. This video can not be played Council tries to ban press and public from meeting Deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, property and regeneration, Rock Feilding-Mellen, has also stood down. The fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington destroyed 151 homes, both in the tower and in surrounding areas. Documents obtained by the BBCsuggest cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, which was less fire resistant. The tower's cladding has been the focus of attention, amid suggestions it was why the flames spread so quickly. The head of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation has also stepped aside so he can focus on ""assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". Did you live in Grenfell Tower?

"As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot can do anything - apart from getting people to pronounce her name correctly. You've probably been calling her GalGah-dote orGalGah-dohall this time. Or maybe you're not at all sure and have been mumbling her surname, hoping no one will notice. But the Israeli actress recently cleared up the confusion bytelling Jimmy Kimmel,externalit's actually pronounced GalGad-dott. She's not the only one who's struggled with name issues. Here are a few other famous faces whose name you may have been saying wrong. Twenty years ago, no one had heard of Harry Potter author JK Rowling. But with great fame comes great name mispronunciation. Is itRoe-lingorRowl-ling? The author once corrected an interviewer saying: ""It'sRolling- as in Stone."" Mamma Mia! star Amanda Seyfried is constantly correcting people on how to say her name. Sieg-freed,Sigh-freed, Sieg-fredandSay-freedhave all been said to her face, and every time she cringes.

How is that? Well, it's pretty much the way everyone pronounces it:Strei-zand. ""She pronounces my name wrong,"" the singer told NPR. ""Streisand with a soft S, like sand on the beach."" So that'sStrei-sandto you and me. Shia LaBeouf famously wore a paper bag on his head at the Berlin Film Festival in 2014, saying he wasn't famous anymore.

"Adele has been touring for 14 months Thousands of fans hoping to catch the finale of Adele's world tour are missing out after it came to an abrupt end at Wembley Stadium. Wednesday's and Thursday's concerts unexpectedly drew the curtains on an epic global odyssey that has taken her to almost 50 cities in 20 different countries. The ""devastated"" singer said on Friday night that she hadsought medical adviceafter damaging her vocal cords and could not perform her final two gigs at Wembley on Saturday and Sunday evening. The 29-year-old singer has been on the road since 29 February last year, performing one sold-out gig after another to her adoring legions of fans. There have been plenty of memorable moments along the way - and plenty of bad language too.According to The Sun,external, her Wembley date earlier this week contained 56 swear words. Here are six classic moments that ensured it wasn't just her vocals that her fans went home remembering. The singer has rarely been seen without a mug on stage If Adele's fans want to stand up to watch her sing, they can damn well stand up. It's a lesson one steward at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium learned to his cost in March this year for conduct that saw him get an ear-bashing from the main attraction. ""Excuse me sir, I know you work here but can you stop telling people to sit down?"" she can be heard sayingin one fan video,external. ""This is a music show,"" she continued. ""If people can't see, then they can stand up."" While performing at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Adele found time to attack magazines for speculating about her private life. Her diatribe,captured on Twitter,external, singled out ""those terrible trashy gossip celebrity magazines"". ""I can't even read them anymore because they're normally writing [nonsense] about me,"" she went on - using a slightly different word to nonsense. ""I swear to God it's all lies."" The rant came just a few days after a concert in Brisbane in which shecasually confirmed,externalshe had married her long-time partner Simon Konecki. Brisbane was also the location for the memorable moment when Adele lost her cool over a rogue mosquito. ""There's a bug on me!"" she was seen screamingin one YouTube video,external. ""I'm sorry, I'm not Australian - I don't like bugs. ""It was sucking my blood!"" the singer went on. ""They're everywhere, they're all trying to kill me! Oh my god, how embarrassing."" Adele was in more forgiving mood while performing in New Zealand, enlisting the aid of an audience member toshoo some beetles off the stage,external. Adele enlisted this selfie seeker to help her dispel insects in Auckland Marriage proposals were a regular occurrence during Adele's concerts, much to her delight. It all began on her opening night in Belfast on 29 February last year, when she encouraged an audience member to accept a leap-year proposal from his female partner. A few weeks later a fan proposed during one of her London concerts - a moment the singer called ""the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed at one of my shows"". In May last year, while performing in Copenhagen, Adele looked on as a fan proposed to his boyfriend. She then offered to be the surrogate mother of their children. Further proposals followed in Zurich, Barcelona, Toronto and Melbourne, as documented bythis article on Vulture,external. Adele is usually tight-lipped about her private life off stage. On it, though, she can be an open book. While performing in Nashville in October, for example, she was hilariously candid about her plans to give her son Angelo a sibling. ""My son is about to turn four very, very soon,"" she wasquoted as saying,external. ""I'm starting to get very emotional about it because I feel like once they turn four, they're not really your actual baby anymore. ""So my womb is starting to ache a little bit. It's like, 'Baby, baby, baby. Need a baby, need a baby.'"" But she immediately insisted she was not pregnant and had no plans to become so ""until the end of the tour"". Adele's tour concludes at Wembley Stadium in London Adele made the news again earlier this week by encouraging fans at Wembley Stadium to donate money to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower blaze. ""It's our job as human beings to be compassionate,""she told the 98,000 present on Wednesday. ""You'll be hearing a lot more from me about [Grenfell] in the days and weeks and probably years to come. ""They're not receiving the things we think they are,""she said the following night,external. ""No information is getting through, people feel helpless. It's chaos."" Her plea followed her attendance at a vigil for victims of the fire and the visit she made - with cake -to see firefighters at Chelsea Fire Station.

"Police cordoned off the scene following reports of multiple shootings at a nightclub At least 25 people have been shot at a nightclub in the US state of Arkansas, two of whom are in critical condition, police say. Three others were injured in a stampede of people fleeing the scene. The youngest victim was said to be 16. The exchange of gunfire took place at about 02:30 local time (07:30 GMT) at a concert, but there was no immediate information about a suspect. Police and local officials said the incident was not terrorism-related. The mayor of Little Rock, Mark Stodola, said it was the result of a disagreement involving a number of patrons at the Power Ultra Lounge nightclub, which quickly escalated because of ""the presence of rivalries and weapons"". ""I want to reassure our public that this was not an act of terrorism, but a tragedy... It does not appear to be a planned shooting,"" Mr Stodola told reporters. He said that all of the 28 people injured in the incident were expected to survive. Little Rock police chief Kenton Buckner said the authorities were investigating whether a longstanding rivalry between gangs was to blame.

"Messi first met his future bride when he was just five years old Argentine football star Lionel Messi has married his childhood sweetheart in his hometown in what has been called the ""wedding of the century"". A civil ceremony for Messi, 30, and Antonela Roccuzzo, 29, was held at a luxury hotel in the city of Rosario. Football stars and celebrities were among the 260 guests, with hundreds of police deployed for the event. Messi, the Argentina and Barcelona forward, met Roccuzzo as a child before he moved to Spain aged just 13. Among the guests at Friday's wedding were Messi's Barcelona teammates Luis SuÃ¡rez, Neymar, Gerard PiquÃ© and his wife, Colombia's pop star Shakira. A number of guests flew into Rosario on private jets. Argentina's ClarÃ­n newspaper has variously called the wedding ""the wedding of the year"" and ""the wedding of the century"". Many of Messi's former teammates, including Xavi Hernandez, Cesc FÃ bregas and Carles Puyol attended with their partners Argentine footballer Ezequiel Lavezzi was also spotted on the red carpet Gerard PiquÃ© (left) and his wife Shakira posed for a picture with airport staff as they arrived in Rosario Crowds gathered outside the hotel in Rosario Earlier, crowds gathered at the local airport to try to spot some of the famous guests. A private security firm was working inside the hotel to keep out potential gatecrashers. About 150 journalists received accreditation to enter a special press area, but were not given full access to the venue, organisers said. Artist Lisandro Urteaga paints a celebratory mural of Messi on a wall in Rosario ahead of the wedding Messi met Roccuzzo when he was just five years old. She is the cousin of his best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who also became a professional football player. Messi accepted an offer to play for Barcelona when he was 13, on condition that they pay for treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Meet the Iranian Messi Messi statue decapitated in Buenos Aires He has spoken about the difficulties he faced on leaving behind his loved ones and former club. Lionel Messi is joined on the pitch by Antonela Roccuzzo and the couple's two sons The couple, who now live in Barcelona, have two sons together. In May, his appeal against a 21-month jail term for tax evasion in Spain was rejected. He is unlikely to go to prison as the sentence can be served under probation or possiblyavoided by paying a fine. The event was held at Rosario's City Center hotel complex, which has an adjoining casino. Rosario's Hotel CityCenter set up for a previous event Roccuzzo, 29, was widely expected to wear a dress by Rosa Clara, a Barcelona-based designer who has dressed actress Eva Longoria and Spain's Queen Letizia. Aside from a ""sushi station"", the menu was a very Argentine affair, including empanadas (traditional pasties) and all parts of the cow, from a casserole of sweetbreads to blood sausage. Messi invited the Barcelona squad, including Neymar, Luis SuÃ¡rez and Gerard PiquÃ©, who arrived in Rosario in a private jet with his wife, Colombian pop-star Shakira. Teammates from Argentina's national team, including Sergio AgÃ¼ero, were also present. ClarÃ­n reported that Messi did not invite any of his recent coaches, including Pep Guardiola, who is now at Manchester City. Argentina's other big football legend, Diego Maradona, was also omitted from the list, according to the local press. Uruguayan footballer Luis SuÃ¡rez touches down in Rosario for his teammate's big day The port city of Rosario sits on the banks of the ParanÃ¡, about 300km north-west of Buenos Aires in the centre of the country. Another famous Argentine to have spent his early years here is Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Messi is known locally simply as LÃ­o. A mural of Che Guevara next to the Newell's Old Boys club logo He has been a local hero since his days as a star player for Newell's Old Boys.

She had been due to perform at Wembley on Saturday and Sunday, ending a four-date run at the venue. Six golden moments from Adele's world tour In her post, the 29-year-old said her first two Wembley shows this week had been ""the biggest and best shows of my life"", but that she had struggled vocally. Despite the voice problems, Adele's performances on 28 and 29 June were well-received by critics, with theGuardian,externaldescribing her as ""instinctively charismatic"",the Times,externalas ""poignant"", whilethe Telegraph,externalwrote: ""She is such a natural on stage."" Adele explained: ""I had to push a lot harder than I normally do... it turns out I have damaged my vocal cords. ""On medical advice, I am simply unable to perform over the weekend. ""I've considered doing Saturday night's show, but it's highly unlikely I'd even make it through the set and I simply can't crumble in front of you all and walk out on you in that way."" She added that she was so desperate to be with her fans that she had even considered miming at the final two shows. ""But I've never done it and I cannot in a million years do that to you. It wouldn't be the real me up there,"" Adele said. ""I'm sorry for your disappointment... You know I would not make this decision lightly."" She concluded by saying refunds would be available if the shows could not be rescheduled. ""There will be more information over the next few days. I'm sorry, I'm devastated... please forgive me x."" It is not the first time Adele has experienced problems with her vocal cords. In 2011, she underwent throat surgery to remove a benign polyp. Wednesday's Adele concert at Wembley was attended by 98,000 fans - a stadium record for a UK music event. In a message in the programme, the singer indicated her four Wembley shows could be her last ever tour dates. ""I wanted my final shows to be in London because I don't know if I'll ever tour again,"" she said. ""I've done 119 shows and these last four will take me up to 123, it has been hard but an absolute thrill and pleasure to have done.""

"Die Toten Hosen in 1989 When music captures the spirit of freedom it can cross any border. In 1961, Communist East Germany built a wall across Berlin, and tried to seal itself off from the West. But new research shows how concrete, barbed wire and a huge effort by the secret police, the Stasi, failed to silence the seductive beat of rock and roll and punk. The rise of Beatlemania in the 1960s brought a scathing response from Walter Ulbricht, the leader of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). ""Do we really have to copy all the rubbish that comes from the Westâ¦ with all the monotony of their 'Yeah, yeah, yeah,'"" he sneered during one of his turgid speeches to the Communist Party faithful. He was 70 years old and in some ways his comments weren't so different from those of many Western politicians, says Dagmar Hovestaedt, a senior figure at the BStU, the organisation investigating the archives of the East German secret police, the Stasi. ""The older generation, the war generation, was aghast at what youth was doing,"" she says. But for East Germany's leaders, much more was at stake. They feared that love of Western music would lead to love of Western politics. So they desperately tried to develop ""their own version of cool youth culture"". There were state-planned dance steps, such as the Lipsi, an attempt to prevent the rise of rock and roll dancing. There was also a ludicrous and much ignored quota system restricting how much Western music could be played at parties. But ""you can't organise a youth culture,"" Hovestaedt says. ""That's not how it works."" Which is why many young East Germans remained glued to their radios, trying to catch the latest tunes beamed in by Western stations, and the Stasi did what it could to stop them. Listen toRocking the Stasion Music Extra, on the BBC World Service Click herefor transmission times, or to catch up later online If there's one story that symbolises GDR paranoia about music - and the tragedy of being a young music fan there - it's the story of a Rolling Stones concert that never happened. It all began in 1969 with a throwaway comment by a DJ on the radio station RIAS - based in West Berlin but much listened to on the other side of the Berlin Wall. Imagine, he said, if the new publishing house built by entrepreneur Axel Springer in the West, right next to the Wall, staged a concert featuring the Stones on its roof so Easterners could come and listen too. Stasi photographs of crowds in East Berlin gathering to hear the Rolling Stones In East Germany the DJ's notion quickly became rumour and then widely believed fact. Thousands of young East Germans convinced themselves that the Stones really would play. And, what's more, on the same day their rulers were planning a day of celebrations in East Berlin to mark the 20th anniversary of the GDR's founding. Cue panic among the Stasi. They hated Springer - seen as a capitalist ogre bent on luring young people away from the communist faith. Their files from the time are full of things like photographs of slogans chalked on roads in East German towns telling Stones fans to come to Berlin - and reports detailing how the Stasi tracked down and arrested the subversive sloganisers. But hundreds did still come to Berlin on the day. I met Eckart Mann, then a 16-year-old, at the same spot opposite the Springer building where he'd waited in 1969. He'd heard the rumour, and thought, ""Stones, play here. Wow, wow, wow!"" In fact, the Stones never appeared, but the GDR authorities did. As the crowd moved towards the Brandenburg Gate the policed arrived, and Mann was beaten and arrested. He was convicted of being an ""anti-socialist element"". In his files I discovered that the head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke, had taken a personal interest in his case. Mann was given two years in prison, then expelled to the West, away from his family. Eckart Mann, near the spot where he was arrested 48 years ago ""What was prison like?"" I ask. He shrugged. ""Not OK, but what could I do?"" he says. And so a teenager paid a bitter price for his love of music. That kind of brutal reprisal was meant to deter all young East Germans from dancing to Western ""imperialist"" tunes. But the hunger for Western music just grew - reaching places a long way from the big cities. Young people suspected of listening to Western music, secretly snapped by the Stasi (1969) Another teenager, Alexander Kuehne, was desperate to bring more music into his life in a remote village hours from Berlin. What about getting hold of the latest Western records? As pensioners  - not seen as vital to the state - were allowed by the GDR regime to visit the West, he'd give his grandmother shopping lists. It didn't go well. She misread The Clash and came back with Johnny Cash - you can still see the pain in Alexander's face as he recalls this ""huge nightmare"". So instead he decided to turn his village into a major music venue. It happened to be near a major rail junction, and he persuaded all kinds of music fans and bands to head for the room behind the village pub. ""This place is where we made the biggest parties in East Germany,"" he says, as he shows me round. Farmers at the bar would look on bemused as hundreds of New Wave fans or Glamrockers headed past them - with up to 1,000 packing a hall meant, according to police regulations, to hold only 100. As it was so remote the police and Stasi were slow to react to these huge gatherings - apart from on one occasion when Alexander was arrested, taken to a police station and told the Stasi would come for him the next day. ""I was very frightened,"" he says. Alexander Kuehne in the pub today Luckily for him his mother had once taught the local police officer. She ordered him to release her son, and then dealt with the Stasi when they arrived. She never told her son exactly what happened. ""She's my hero"" is all he says now, with quiet admiration. But back in the big cities pressure from the Stasi was relentless on music fans seen as ""subversive"" and ""anti-social"". I remember visiting East Berlin in the early 1980s, seeing a few punks on the streets, and thinking you've got to be brave wearing slashed clothes, safety pins and spiky hair when the regime wanted you parading in a socialist youth group uniform. Berlin's Stasi Museum displays the police mugshot of an arrested punk But how could the secret police deal with or even understand something like punk? The archives contain recordings of Stasi meetings where the organisation's boss Erich Mielke tried to get his brain - and his tongue - around such utterly baffling concepts as punks and heavy metal fans. I managed to track down JÃ¼rgen Breski, then a Stasi officer ordered to monitor and infiltrate the punk scene. He agreed to meet in a discreet corner of a city-centre restaurant and tell me what his bosses had wanted him to do. ""They wanted to bring a kind of socialist lifestyle to the people so we tried to combat anything that didn't belong to that,"" he says. ""The aim was to control 'the scene' as it expanded, to stop it from becoming too well known."" In the end the Stasi did what it always did -recruited as many informers as possible. Other tactics including calling up members of illegal bands for compulsory military service and sending them to different parts of the country. ""Suddenly the band had no musicians,"" Breski says. An outdoor punk concert in East Berlin (1985) But many were determined to resist. Dirk Kalinowski from the punk band Zerfall told me how the Stasi put heavy pressure on him and his band. They survived as performers thanks to an extraordinary alliance with a Berlin church which gave them shelter. The GDR authorities, mostly ruthless, were wary of attracting international attention by interfering directly with church activities. The church, he says, was a ""protected space"". ""They could arrest you as you arrived in front of the door or as you left.  But here inside you were safe."" So his group - banned by the state from normal concerts - was able to perform in the middle of Evangelical church services. The pastor would pauseâ¦ and then ask his mostly elderly congregation to listen to something just a bit different. ""It was mad,"" Kalinowski remembers. ""As front man I could see right into the faces of the congregation who were completely shocked. The only ones who were laid back about it were the children who jumped up straight away. I'll never forget it - one old couple covered their ears and then walked out."" A church also provided the venue for another extraordinary concert, when British music producer Mark Reeder managed to smuggle a West German punk band, Die Toten Hosen, across the Berlin Wall to play a concert. Mark Reeder before the fall of the Wall ""I told my friends, 'If I get caught I get thrown out of the country. If you get caught your lives will change because you'll be classed as enemies of the state,'"" recalls Reeder. ""They said, 'We don't care we'll do it anyway.'"" Campino, lead singer of Die Toten Hosen, remembers how the band disguised themselves to get through border controls between West and East Berlin. ""We had to comb our hair, get proper clothes on."" He knew why the East German authorities would stop them if they recognised them. ""Punk rock didn't officially exist in the East, they didn't want to spread the virus in any form."" Only around 25 could come to the secret concert in an East Berlin church.  But ""everyone in the room know this was something very special and maybe would never happen again"". Campino performing with the Toten Hosen in 2015 He was very impressed, he says, with the way young East Germans created their own cultural space in spite of - or perhaps because of - all the regime's pressure. ""They had a certain kind of pride, a belief. They said, 'You in the West you've got the best clothing, the fashion, all those things. But we've got friendship and we help each other and we're not superficial,'"" he says. Their friendships ""meant more because they had to pay a bigger price for everything that went wrong"", as he puts it. And so this amazing musical life rocked on - soundtrack to a kind of freedom that few outsiders ever realised was possible. Yes, the regimes could impose all kinds of restrictions. But still music fans created free spaces, a unique state of mind across communist-ruled Europe. Mikhail Gorbachev and East German leader Erich Honecker sing the International in East Berlin (1986) From the mid-1980s, as a new leader in Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev, began loosening the Soviet grip on East Germany, Western music was reverberating more and more strongly around the Berlin Wall itself. In 1987 no less a figure than David Bowie played a concert right by the Wall on the Western side - Bowie a global star who'd lived in Berlin, knew its surreal Cold War atmosphere and musical energy well. And fans from the East gathered near the Wall to try and listen. For the relatively young deputy police chief of East Berlin, Dieter Dietze, this posed a professional and personal dilemma. He knew a brutal police response - like that against those who'd come hoping to hear the Rolling Stones in 1969 - would be counter-productive. And as a rock fan himself who'd once played in a band, he told me he had much sympathy with the young fans. But GDR bosses still wanted order above all. ""It was clear to me that music, rock music belonged to young people, that there was no way you could deny that to young people. So I and a couple of others began to argue - why don't we do something like this?"" he says. The GDR authorities were persuaded to allow concerts on their territory by global superstars including Bob Dylan and, in 1988, Bruce Springsteen. It was meant as a safety valve to appease the younger generation. But the concerts just amplified a new spirit of freedom. A Stasi report on the Dylan concert struggles with the name of Tom Petty's band Concerts like Bruce Springsteen's, says Dagmar Hovestaedt, ""became a rallying point for demands for human rights, for access to travel and to express yourself. Imagine - 100,000 young East Germans singing 'Born in the USA'."" Whereas in the 1960s Rolling Stones fans hoping to hear their heroes had faced persecution, ""in the 80s that fear had gone, the state had lost control"". There are many reasons, political and economic, why the Cold War came to an end. But that spirit of freedom that brought thousands on the streets in 1989 to challenge communist regimes was also vital. And that spirit had been sustained - for many - by music. After the Wall came down and the GDR disappeared so too did the Stasi. Former officers like JÃ¼rgen Breski have had much time to reflect on their attempt to control everything - and why it failed. ""From today's perceptive much seems pointless, a waste of effort,"" he told me. When it came to punk music ""sometimes we had influence, but in the end there were no results"" . And what about the young people persecuted, sometimes imprisoned, for their love of music? ""Today I'd be against doing something like that. But you grow up in a society, grow with this society's norms, you profit from them. And when later you have the chance to see that from a different perspective you say: 'OK - it shouldn't have been that way.'"" Concrete borders, machine guns and barbed wire could stop some things. But not music. ""Music comes into your spirit and your head and you listen,"" says Dagmar Hovestaedt. For her, it all goes back to an old German proverb:Die Gedanken sind frei- thoughts are free. ""Music that can't be stopped by borders reminds you constantly there is joy in self-expression.""

"It's hard to forget that first rude awakening when you realise what others really think of your country. For me, it was February 1988. There I was, living in the great city of London, after I finally obtained a work permit. And there it was, in black and white in a British newspaper covering the Winter Olympics in the western Canadian city of Calgary. ""One of the world's coldest countries in winter excels in its sports"". And, the columnist wrote, if there was an Olympics for being boring, Canada would also win gold. A gold medal for boredom? How could that be?  For years, that's what I heard about Canada. Look what they write now. The Lonely Planet Travel Guide's top destination this year? Canada. And last year, the New York Times Style section asked ""Canada is suddenly... hip?"" The notion, it wrote, that ""our neighbour to the north is a frozen cultural wasteland populated with hopelessly unstylish citizens is quickly becoming so outdated to be almost offensive"". Exactly. For the writer, and Lonely Planet, this sudden volte-face had a lot to do with what was described as the ""muscular, blue-eyed social media savvy son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau"". It is true that Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party swept back into power in October 2015, has sent Canada rocketing up the charts. 'At school, they called me Pocahontas' Canada to apologise for past 'LGBT purge' It's partly because of his willingness to take selfies, and take off his shirt while jogging, surfing, canoeing, you name it. But he has also been taking to every global stage: talking about a Canada committed to climate change; personally welcoming Syrian refugees he calls ""new Canadians;"" and giving President Donald Trump the strongest of handshakes while still trying to strengthen Canada's relationship with its most vital trading partner. I often get asked about Canada's Prime Minister. ""He's the right leader,"" asserted an Italian businesswoman when I recently visited northern Italy. Then, pausing, she added, ""but of course you need the right people too"". Everyone around our lunch table nodded in agreement.  A marketing executive offered a description of Canadians - ""smart, caring, forward looking"". Then, searching for exactly the right word, she exclaimed -  ""Nice!"" Everyone around the table nodded vigorously. Nice, polite, friendly. You hear that description a lot. Is that a new way to say boring? I'm never sure you can describe an entire nation, in this case nearly thirty six million people, in the same way. But, even I notice when I go to Canada, how friendly people are - even in the lifts, or should I say elevators? ""How was your day? You have a nice evening planned for tonight?"" strangers inquire as doors open and shut. Even before 45-year-old Justin Trudeau emerged as Canada's poster boy, global indexes gave my country high marks. This video can not be played Why are these top athletes still seeking recognition? Take just one. In 2015, the Reputation Index, an annual survey ranking developed nations, called Canada the ""most admired"" for its ""effective government, absence of corruption, welfare support system,"" and yes, its ""friendly and welcoming people"". Year in, year out, major Canadian cities are rated as among the most liveable in the world. Even so, Canada's place on the world stage has definitely shifted. ""The new prime minister and his Liberal Party have made a difference,"" explains a prominent Canadian journalist when I ask why that is. ""But don't forget they are the embodiment of what Canadians voted for."" That has included accepting more than 30,000 Syrian refugees, with half of them sponsored by citizens who clubbed together to support the new families. There's also been a gender balanced cabinet and, most recently a new ""feminist foreign aid policy."" Canada also played a key role in clinching the Paris accord on climate change, and is seeking a return to a version of the peacekeeping Canada played a key role creating in the 1950s. None are without criticism at home, but all have been popular - in Canada and beyond. This video can not be played Welcome to Tilt Cove, population - four Of course, Canada is blessed by geography too. The world's second biggest land mass, surrounded by three oceans and a border with the United States, has always been able to select and screen its immigrants, rather than seeing them show up on its shores. Or at least that was the case until some refugees, fleeing new restrictions in the United States, started crossing the border. As Canadian students, we learn that our country is a mosaic of many peoples, and our neighbour to the south is a melting pot. Indigenous women inquiry hears testimony Justin Trudeau asks Pope for apology But what we didn't study enough, and our governments didn't do enough about, is a subject being focused on as never before - the troubled history of Canada's indigenous peoples who've been on the land for more than 10,000 years. They're not happy with all the fuss and fanfare about Canada's 150th birthday when land rights, as well as economic conditions and social justice, are still major issues. ""Global recognition of Canada has certainly increased,"" Dr Annis May Timpson, an Oxford University professor and leading UK expert on Canadian politics, including its indigenous peoples. ""I hope it will look beyond the celebration of 150 years of Confederation to take a lead globally to ensure full and effective reconciliation with all its indigenous communities."" A nation forged in 1867 from British colonies, and former French ones, is still redefining its identity. The language divide, which once threatened to tear Canada apart, is no longer a burning political issue between the predominantly French speaking province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. But Canadians still have lots to debate  - from how a major oil producer should tackle climate change, to which ice hockey team is the best, and whether the prime minister should be photo bombing unsuspecting high school prom-goers.

"""They were in love, they loved each other,"" Pedro Ruiz's aunt said of the aspiring YouTubers Monalisa Perez, 19, and her boyfriend Pedro Ruiz, 22, wanted to be famous on YouTube. But until a dramatic stunt on 26 June involving a gun and a hardcover book that left Pedro dead, there was little indication in their videos how far they were prepared to go in order to attain online celebrity. The couple from the US state of Minnesota had been uploading videos for less than two months documenting their everyday lives. Though they had filmed some minor pranks - Monalisa dusting a donut with baby powder before feeding it to Pedro, for example - they seemed relatively harmless. In one video filmed in a hospital, they learn their new baby is going to be a boy. ""Imagine when we have 300,000 subscribers,"" Monalisa pondered in a video uploaded at a fun fair on the day Pedro was killed. ""People will be like 'oh my god, hi!'"" Now she faces a second-degree manslaughter charge over a reckless stunt that was said to be her boyfriend's idea to boost their profile. She fired a Desert Eagle handgun from close range, as he held an encyclopaedia in front of his chest. He had experimented previously and thought the thick book would protect him, but the couple's three-year-old child and nearly 30 onlookers watched as she fired a fatal bullet. She told police the stunt had been Ruiz's idea, and that he had to convince her to do it Since YouTube launched in 2005, it has attracted people willing to do things on camera for a slice of minor online fame. But in 2012, the company made it easier for contributors to obtain a chunk of the advertising revenue they generate from videos. Studios were created and grants given out to groom a stable of stars who need to make fresh, compelling content to keep the clicks - and advertising dollars - rolling in. They are often media personalities in their own right, with agents and slickly produced videos. Hundreds of thousands of others, like the Minnesota couple, sit below them and are trying to gather followings. Many have little success. Google pledge to tackle terror videos The daredevils feeding a dangerous Russian craze But the rewards of becoming one of the few who make it big can be a huge motivation to keep trying. (According to Forbes,external, the top 12 highest-earning YouTube stars made a combined $70.5m from June 2015 - June 2016.) And while stunts are merely one genre of an extremely diverse landscape of videos made by YouTubers - from cooking to comedy and music to beauty - they do get millions of views. Dr Arthur Cassidy, a British psychologist specialising in social media, says videos of dangerous stunts can inspire teenage copycats who ""haven't got the cognitive function to figure out this could be very fatal"". ""It's perceived as being 'fun' or 'exciting' or 'high-risk'. Anything that is high risk is intriguing, gets adrenaline going and sets up highly competitive game playing within the fraternity of late adolescence."" But what the Minnesota couple tried to film is ""one of the most horrific cases"" he has come across. Fears that young people watching from home could try it, but with a less powerful weapon to see if it could work, are ""salient and highly profound"", Dr Cassidy says. Doing dangerous things for online attention is nothing new. In 2011, Australian Acton Beale fell to his death after trying to ""plank"" on the balcony of a seventh floor flat in Brisbane. The planking craze - which involved people lying down straight-bodied in unusual, but mostly safe, places - was largely confined to still images uploaded to Facebook. What is planking? Man dangles baby from window for Facebook likes #Deadpose: South Africa's social media craze But the Australian case signalled how a growing internet ""stunt"" culture for attention could lead to tragedy, and since then several online trends have reportedly caused deaths worldwide. Russian Alexander Chernikov set his trousers on fire before jumping into snow. Video of the stunt went viral Of course, YouTube has no borders, and stunt videos from anywhere can go viral globally. Russia's Interior Ministry recently launched a ""safe selfie"" campaign in response to agrowing local culture of amateur daredevils filming their stunts. In one video watched by millions of people, Alexander Chernikov lights his trousers on fire and jumps off a nine-storey building into the snow. These kinds of stunts make the antics of TV pranksters from a pre-YouTube era, like those of the MTV reality show Jackass, seem tame. Critics say that YouTube, owned by Google, needs to do more to take down videos of extremely dangerous stunts. The company said it was ""horrified to learn of the tragedy in Minnesota"" and that its thoughts were with the family. No video of the incident is believed to have been uploaded. A spokesperson told the BBC that it removes content flagged by users that breaks its rules. Its policy on harmful and dangerous content says it draws the line at content ""that intends to incite violence or encourage dangerous or illegal activities that have an inherent risk of serious physical harm or death"". Examples of what would be banned include videos depicting ""bomb making, choking games, hard drug use, or other acts where serious injury may result"".

Lopez is too poor to pay â¬40,000 (Â£35,000; $46,000) in damages after a court ruled she had wrongly accused the nun of taking her from her biological mother and handing her to ageing adoptive parents in 1962. If the government does not pardon her, the 55-year-old will be the first person to be jailed over Spain's enormous baby-snatching racket stemming from the Franco era. Protesters have presented a 30,000-strong petition to Spain's justice ministry calling for her to be let off. ""I have a bone-wasting disease, I have not been able to work for three years and my two children are unemployed and have no contact with their father,"" a tearful  LÃ³pez told the BBC. According to LÃ³pez, her adoptive father, a senior figure in Gen Francisco Franco's regime in Almeria whose marriage was barren, bought her for 250,000 pesetas (about â¬50,000, Â£44,000 , $57,000 in today's money) via his niece, Dolores Baena, a nun working in a Seville hospital at the time. Her father was 67, and her new mother around 60.  Dolores became her cousin. When she was eight, she came home from school to find local dignitaries in her parents' bedroom. Before her lay her father's body. He had suffered a stroke and died. ""I went to my room to cry, and a member of the family came to see me and asked why I was crying for that man who had nothing to do with me, but had only bought me when I was a new-born."" Ascension's adoptive father died when she was eight Asking for information from her mother and relatives, LÃ³pez began to suspect there was something not quite right about her adoption, long before the issue of babies being stolen from poor or politically suspect parents became a public issue in Spain. Spain's stolen babies and the families who lived a lie Spain to open 'stolen' baby archives Spain call to probe 'baby thefts' Nun in Spain 'baby theft' hearing For a start, she had different names on the various bits of paperwork that confirmed her identity. On the first sheet from the Seville hospital nursery where she was kept for a few days, she was called Consuelo. As a small child, her name was MarÃ­a Dolores - ""I was always Loli at home"" - but her first identity card named her officially as MarÃ­a AscensiÃ³n. ""Whatever happened to my mother, I am very clear that my identity was stolen."" AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez believes she was bought by a senior figure in Gen Francisco Franco's regime LÃ³pez asked the nun, her cousin, if she could help her trace her background. ""She told me that, try as she might, I would never find my biological parents. When I was 15 she took me to an orphanage in Almeria and showed me all the babies there. 'If we hadn't done what we did for you, you'd have been left alone, like these children with no family'."" LÃ³pez's investigation has uncovered an adoption sheet signed by Sister Dolores, but the Seville authorities cannot find any document in which her biological mother surrendered her child. As an activist and president of SOS Stolen Babies AlmerÃ­a, representing other possible victims of the stolen baby scandal that stretches over half a century from the 1930s to the 1990s, LÃ³pez spoke of her case in the media, naming Sister Dolores as the person who ""organised"" her illegal adoption. The nun sued her cousin for defamation, winning a 2015 trial. LÃ³pez was ordered to pay a â¬3,000 fine, plus â¬40,000 in damages to Sister Dolores and costs. No documents have been found indicating that AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez was given up by her birth mother During the trial, Sister Dolores declared: ""There was nobody behind the adoption; it was all legal and nobody charged any money."" The judge said AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez had utterly failed to prove that her adoption had been illegally carried out by her cousin and had falsely accused her. Sister Dolores did not reply to requests by the BBC to comment for this article. LÃ³pez admits she may have been ""careless"" in her wording when accusing the nun, but feels let down by the legal system. ""I was judged as a daughter, as a mother and as a woman; my whole life was put on trial."" Estimates of the number of cases of stolen babies in Spain range from 30,000 to 300,000. This video can not be played Manoli Pagador told the BBC in 2011 how her baby son was taken away from her in 1971 Almost all of thousands of cases reported to the courts have led nowhere. But later this year, Eduardo Vela, an 82-year-old Madrid gynaecologist, is due to become the first person to go on trial accused of baby snatching. LÃ³pez, who cared for her adoptive mother before she died in 1990, says that she too has fallen into bad health and economic ruin. She suffers from a rare bone condition and an inherited blood disorder. ""They have erased my memories. I look at my son and wonder who he looks like. I look at my daughter and wonder if she could have the same disease as me because it's genetically transmitted. ""I just wonder what happened and how did I end up here?"" 2008: Investigating judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n writes that 30,000 children were stolen from families considered politically suspect by the Franco regime after the 1936-39 civil war Thousands of possible victims come forward and new associations are formed demanding justice and help in finding lost relatives in an estimated 200,000 cases Some 2,000 reported cases of alleged stolen children have been reported but prosecutors have closed all but a handful of investigations 2013: Maria Gomez Valbuena, an 87-year-old nun facing two charges of kidnapping and falsifying documents, dies before going on trial May 2017: UK MEP Jade Kirton-Darling announces that Spain's Catholic Church and health ministry have promised to open their archives to help those possibly affected by child snatching in the country's hospitals.

"This video can not be played Richard Herrington: ""It's that free oxygen that gives us the diversity of life we have on Earth today"" You're going to want to touch it; you're definitely going to want to run your fingers over its wavy lines. This 2.5-tonne lump of rock will be one of the new star exhibits when London's Natural History Museum re-opens its front entrance-space in a couple of weeks' time. The Hintze Hall has been closed for most of this year to allow the South Kensington attraction to remodel its welcome to visitors. Out has gone ""Dippy"" the diplodocus dinosaur, and in its place has come a massive skeleton of a blue whale. From 14 July, as you go into the NHM, you'll be confronted by the largest animal on the planet diving down at you from the ceiling. Your correspondent has had a sneak peek, and it's spectacular. Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy Dippy dinosaur's tour stops announced The NHM's blue whale skeleton is to take centre-stage from now on But look around the edges of the hall and you'll see its alcoves have also been refreshed. The NHM is calling them the ""Wonder Bays"". The Wonder Bays aim to showcase the origins, evolution and diversity of life on Earth I want you to head for one alcove in particular on the right, just under the whale's tail. It'll hold a specimen of banded iron formation, or BIF. About 2m along the base and 1.5m high, the object represents a wonderful juxtaposition between the animate (whale) and the inanimate (rock) and the very deep connection that exists between the two. BIFs were laid down on ocean floors more than two billion years ago. They record a key chemical transition in Earth's history when oxygen started to become abundant. It was a profound change that would ultimately make complex life - such as the giant cetaceans - possible. Those wavy lines in the BIF are bands of iron oxide (mostly haematite) interspersed with chert (silica). Rio Tinto donated the BIF, sourcing it from a mine in north-western Australia Earth's early oceans would have been full of reduced iron in solution that had been washed off the continents, and when it combined with the nascent oxygen being produced by photosynthetic bacteria, the resulting oxides would have precipitated to settle on the seafloor. The different layers incorporated into the rock probably mark cycles of bacterial boom and bust. Ultimately, all of the right type of iron in the ancient waters was consumed and the free oxygen had nowhere else to go but up and out into the atmosphere. Earth had become a different place. ""The rock tells a fantastic story,"" says Prof Richard Herrington, the head of Earth sciences at the NHM. ""This is the prelude to complex life. We're oxygen breathers. An organism needs an energy source and the burning of carbon in the presence of oxygen is largely where we get our energy from. It still took two billion years from this rock to get to multicellular organisms, but that's another story,"" he told BBC News. The Imilac meteorite was found in the Atacama Desert in Chile in 1822 Part of the decision to put the whale centre-stage at the museum is to highlight issues of sustainability - to get us all to think a little deeper about how we use Earth's resources. BIFs are an important commercial material. Their iron content has helped build the modern world. The Wonder Bay rock comes from the Pilbara region in north-western Australia. Rio Tinto identified the block at one of its open-cast mines, and had it cut, polished and shipped to London. ""The piece itself is not actually ore-grade; it's got about 32% iron in it, when most of the product we produce out of the Pilbara is between 58% and 62% iron,"" explained Stephen McIntosh, a senior executive with Rio Tinto. ""But the rock's got all the qualities and textures you'd want to see. And, as you say, it records an amazing moment in time - a time that was incredibly important for the Earth we live on today."" The BIF will be joined by nine other Wonder Bay objects, including a blue marlin, a giantTurbinariacoral and a Chilean meteorite that is regarded as one of the most beautiful ever recovered because of its large olivine crystals. Seaweeds will feature in a Wonder Bay to highlight the incredible complexity of the Tree of Life The rock installation is supported by the Claude and Sofia Marion Foundation Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Newsnight has obtained confidential reports that help explain how flammable material has become more common on tall buildings. Combustible cladding has been permitted based on reports arguing fires involving combustible aluminium panels would behave similarly to ones with non-combustible ceramic tiles. Developers use them to persuade inspectors to sign off buildings. Exova, the company that produced the reports, refused to comment. The company, also known as Exova Warringtonfire, is a fire testing and engineering company. It has previously cited client confidentiality in refusing to comment and has not responded to requests since Newsnight obtained copies of the reports relating to two buildings late on Friday afternoon. The confidential reports obtained by Newsnight contain assessments that persuaded inspectors that a given cladding design was safe and met legal standards. Part of the engineers' reasoning was that, in a fire test, you would get similar results if you were to use either combustible aluminium panels or non-combustible ceramic tiles. As a consequence, it argued, you could use successful fire tests involving ceramic tiles as a guide to the likely fire safety of a system using aluminium panels. The report said: ""If this... would be tested... the external flame spread results would be comparable to those with ceramic tile."" While there is no test that contradicts the authors' conclusions about the safety of the proposed cladding system, experts were surprised at the arguments advanced by the authors, which they felt was not strongly supported by evidence. Aluminium composite panels are two sheets of thin aluminium around a ""core"" of some other substance. In a fire, these panels can ""delaminate"": the outer aluminium peels away, exposing the inner core. If the inner core is combustible, these panels can allow the rapid spread of fire. Ceramic tiles do not contain combustible material and do not have layers that can come apart. That fire performance is why so much attention has been paid to the use of aluminium panelling with a plastic core on Grenfell Tower. The government is currently demanding local authorities and housing associations send in samples of aluminium panelling for test. One of the documents obtained by Newsnight was used to approve materials now in use in the Greetham Street student residences run by Unite Students, a student accommodation provider, in Portsmouth. The two reports both related to a style of cladding system similar to that used at Grenfell Tower: a combustible insulation material underneath aluminium composite panels. Neither of the reports, though, proposed using the same materials as those used on Grenfell Tower. Both reports related to aluminium cladding containing fire retardants. While the reports related to slightly different designs and had different authors, both advanced the same technical arguments which concerned experts. These assessments, one said, ""appeared to extrapolate an apple into an orange"" and they agreed that this showed up weaknesses in the way that we make sure buildings are fire safe. These reports - known as""desktop studies""- are a legal alternative to laboratory testing. There areseveral regulatory routesto demonstrating to an inspector that cladding is safe on a tall building. First, all the parts of the cladding can be tested separately and found to be of ""limited combustibility"", broadly meaning that the parts will not catch alight or spread fire. If, however, some parts do not meet that standard, developers can arrange for a laboratory to construct a model of the entire proposed wall system and assess what would happen in a fire. But if a developer wishes to follow plans similar to a setup which has already been fire-tested, they can ask an engineer to perform a desktop study, certifying that the proposed construction would pass the test without the need for one to be carried out. Unite Students have sent cladding for testing and consulted with local fire authorities to make sure their Greetham Street building in Portsmouth in safe The scale of the use of desktop studies is actually still unknown:  they are not published and are even considered commercially confidential. But there is now growing concern in government that desktop studies may be an important factor - directly and indirectly - in explaining whyso many buildingshave been found to have combustible components within their cladding. Newsnight has applied for documents from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to establish whether desktop studies were used to justify the cladding configuration used on the Grenfell Tower. Unite, which runs the building in Portsmouth, said: ""Fire safety is always a key priority for Unite - which is why we work with the Avon Fire and Rescue Service to ensure that our buildings, policies and procedures not only comply with existing regulations but exceed them. ""As a matter of general practice, we regularly review and assess the fire risk in all of our buildings, using members of the Institution of Fire Engineers."" Both documents were commissioned and paid for by Kingspan, the makers of the insulation used in the cladding. Kingspan said: ""In the instances where Kingspan has commissioned desktop studies, it has always been from the UK's most highly respected fire assessment consultancies. ""These experts put their professional reputations on the line when providing their safety opinion and we are very confident that this is never compromised.""

"Jessica Livingston, right, believes women are forcing change in Silicon Valley ""It's been going on for a while."" It's a phrase I've heard a lot since Susan Fowler, an ex-Uber employee, published her explosive blog post thatultimately toppled one of the most powerful chief executives in San Francisco. ""I'll tell you - Susan Fowler kicked off a big thing here,"" says Jessica Livingston, who co-created Y Combinator, the most highly-respected start-up investment programme in Silicon Valley. ""That's what you have to understand. This stuff was happening all the time and people were complaining to their confidants and sharing it with their family. ""No-one was coming forward on the record with 'here's an account of these horrible things that happened to me'. It just felt too scary, a possible career breaker for people. That was the feeling."" But that may be changing, if the mood at Y Combinator's Female Founders conference is anything to go by. The annual event is a gathering of would-be and successful female entrepreneurs. And this year it has been given added vigour. Call it, the ""Uber in the room"". ""We couldn't have this conference without referencing it, I mean come on!"" Ms Livingston continues. ""It's such crazy stuff. I do think there is an undercurrent in the conference today of 'this is awful stuff that's happening, but it's been going on for a while... and now things are going to change.'"" Change won't come easy, but for the first time it may be in reach. Avni Patel Thompson says a support network for new entrepreneurs would help While Uber's crisis has garnered the most headlines, perhaps the more significant fall-from-grace in Silicon Valley this year has been that of Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who just a week ago wasaccused of several instances of sexual harassment,external. In the space of two days he denied the claims, then took a leave of absence, and then resigned. Now the investment firm he founded, Binary Capital, has capitulated - with backers removing their support and, crucially, their money. ""If you look at the way things have played out over the past week at Binary, there's been a change every single day, and it's gotten more dramatic every single day,"" Ms Livingston tells me. ""To the point where we are feeling like people are responding. People are being held accountable - they're not sweeping it under the carpet."" Abuse often harbours in situations when one individual holds the key to another's dream: an actress desperate to land that first big role, or an athlete wanting to get closer to the big leagues. In Silicon Valley, it's often an inexperienced entrepreneur, panicking about rent money, and desperate for that first piece of funding that would set them on their way to creating their company. Those early investments, known as seed funding, are make or break. Laura Behrens-Wu says female entrepreneurs seeking their first funding round are most vulnerable ""Pre-seed, before you're part of the network, that's when women are most vulnerable,"" says Laura Behrens-Wu, co-founder of shipping start-up Shippo, which recently raised $7m. ""They don't know anyone here yet, they don't have anyone to turn to. ""If someone harassed me today I'd have people to turn to, people who can stand up for me and make sure that this never happens again."" Without that support network, Ms Behrens-Wu argues, the prospect of speaking out against abusers is terrifying and insurmountable. ""When [investors] Google your name, you don't want stories about sexual harassment to be the first thing that comes up. ""[Women are] worried they're being seen as the trouble makers by other people."" Filling this support and accountability vacuum could perhaps change things here - something that might give new arrivals in Silicon Valley a strong footing from which to protect themselves. One suggestion,that I wrote about last week, is a ""Decency Pledge"" - a code of conduct shared across the technology industry. That has been met with a mixed response. Surely, many argue, people shouldn't have to sign a ""pledge"" to exercise what should be common decency? Avni Patel Thompson, founder of on-demand childcare start-up Poppy, says the best solution may be to equip new entrepreneurs with the same kind support network that give more experienced women the strength to come forward and confront unacceptable behaviour. ""Everyone talks about backchannel references, right? I think there are those of us that are plugged into certain networks that have access to that. ""But how do we make that accessible to the people that need it the most, which are the folks that are just getting started and don't know up from down and all these type of things. They're just trying to fight the good fight. ""How can we make some of these things available? That's some of the conversations that we, as female founders, are having."" Y Combinator is a tech incubator programme that twice a year takes on a bunch of promising start-ups, gives them about $100,000, and coaches them to potential success. It has spawned several successes, such as Dropbox, Reddit and payments firm Stripe. And for those lucky enough to get on the programme, it also provides an added layer of protection against possible abuses. ""We will speak up on the founders' behalf, always,"" Jessica Livingston tells me. ""We've just launched internally an anonymous forum if anyone has faced racism or harassment they can let us know anonymously. We are trying to do things to help."" But looking long-term, a more gender-diverse technology industry is seen as the only genuine solution to this problem. ""I'm always hoping that more women get into the game,"" Ms Livingston continues. ""We do need to have more female venture capitalists (VCs), and managing director level VCs. Almost all of them are men. ""There are so many things that have to work together to really create change."" ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 A plea for 'decency' in shaken Silicon Valley Uber chief executive Kalanick resigns Uber: The scandals that drove Kalanick out Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Police confirmed this Facebook image to be that of Henry Bello The doctor who attacked his former New York hospital workplace had resigned in 2015 after being accused of sexual harassment, reports said. Henry Bello had also been convicted of sexual assault a decade earlier, the New York Times reported. He opened fire with an assault rifle in the Bronx-Lebanon hospital, killing a female doctor and injuring six other people, five of them seriously. He then shot himself after attempting to set himself on fire, police said. This video can not be played Police and emergency services personnel enter the hospital Some New York newspapers quoted a doctor at the hospital as saying Bello had vowed revenge on his colleagues after he left. ""We fired him because he was kind of crazy,"" Dr Maureen Kwankamtold,externalthe New York Daily News newspaper. ""He promised to come back and kill us then."" In 2004 Bello was charged with sexual abuse and unlawful imprisonment after a 23-year-old woman said he had grabbed her crotch outside a Manhattan building, the New York Timesreported,external. This video can not be played Mayor Bill de Blasio said the shooting was isolated and appeared to be ""workplace-related"" Bello walked into the 1,000-bed hospital at about 14:55 local time (18:55 GMT) with an assault rifle hidden inside his white medical coat, reports said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the attack had been a ""horrific situation in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort"". Several of the injured are ""fighting for their lives,"" he said. The attack began on the 16th floor and all the victims were shot on the 16th and 17th floors. An assault rifle was also discovered nearby, which a local politician separately said appeared to be a military-grade M16 rifle. Doctors were among those injured Messages on social media spoke of doctors and nurses barricading themselves inside the building in the Mount Hope district. One patient in the radiology department, Felix Puno, tweeted: ""Building is in complete shut down, I was in the middle of getting an X-ray when security alerted us to the active shooter situation."" Garry Trimble, whose fiancÃ©e works at the hospital, said security was not good enough. He said: ""I can walk through the back door with an employee. If the employee opens the door, I can walk in. I think every hospital should have one police officer at each entrance. They only ever do something when something happens."" Bronx-Lebanon is a private, not-for-profit hospital that has been operating for 120 years. The shootings happened on the 16th and 17th floors Shootings at hospitals are not common, but there have been several such instances in recent years. In 2015, a man entered a Boston hospital and asked for a cardiologist by name, shooting him dead when he arrived. During the investigation, it emerged that the man's mother had previously been a patient at the hospital. In July 2016, another man opened fire in a patient's room at a Florida medical centre, killing an elderly woman and a hospital worker. The suspect was later deemed to suffer from mental health issues, casting doubt over his competency to stand trial. In July last year, a patient at a Berlin hospital shot a doctor before turning the gun on himself.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong's skyline was lit up with fireworks Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned against ""impermissible"" challenges to Beijing's authority over Hong Kong. Mr Xi was speaking at the swearing-in of the territory's new leaderCarrie Lam, as Hong Kong marked 20 years since its handover to China from Britain. On Saturday afternoon, after Mr Xi had left Hong Kong, thousands of people took part in an annual march calling for greater democracy. During Mr Xi's visit there was little opportunity for protest. An earlier protest had led to clashes with pro-Beijing demonstrators. Mr Xi's visit to the city - his first since becoming Chinese leader in 2013 - came amid tight police security. Several people were detained in the morning, when a small group of pro-democracy activists clashed with pro-Beijing demonstrators close to the site where the lavish ceremony took place. Organisers said 60,000 people took part in the later pro-democracy march, though police said the figure was much lower. Heavy rain affected the march, which started at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. Some protesters carried yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the demonstrations which gripped the city in 2014. Lam Wing-kee, one of the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing in 2015 and re-surfaced in detention on the mainland, addressed the march. One protester carried a cardboard cut-out of President Xi carrying a yellow umbrella The Chinese leader oversaw the swearing in of Ms Lam, the newly-elected chief executive of the territory, along with the rest of her cabinet. She is Hong Kong's first female leader. In a speech he said that Hong Kong needed to ""improve its systems to uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests"".

But while the territory's Basic Law guarantees wide-ranging freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Beijing's refusal to grant universal suffrage has triggered sometimes violent unrest. In Saturday morning's small-scale protests, pro-democracy party Demosisto said police had arrested five of its members, and four members from the League of Social Democrats. This video can not be played One protester gets caught up in a scuffle with police Among those said by the group to have been arrested was Joshua Wong, the leader of the so-calledumbrella protest movement. It was meant to be a routine demonstration by pro-democracy protesters. The leaders of the League of Social Democrats and Demosisto had gathered to make their way to the square in the Wanchai district where the flag-raising ceremony was taking place. They were demanding greater voting rights for Hong Kong, as well the immediate release of theChinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. But without warning, scuffles began between the demonstrators and the police. Faces were slammed to the ground. And then pro-Beijing supporters turned up, waving flags and blaring patriotic music. Each side was shouting abuse at the other. The tussle went on for more than an hour, with it ending only after the leaders of the pro-democracy demonstration were led away by police, who called it an illegal gathering. During the ceremony, the flags of China and Hong Kong were raised alongside one another to mark the 20-year anniversary of the city's handover of British rule. Helicopters flew overhead as onlookers cheered at the ceremony in Golden Bauhinia Square, central Hong Kong.

"London's mayor has urged Theresa May to appoint commissioners to run Kensington and Chelsea council after its leader resigned over the Grenfell Tower fire. Sadiq Khan welcomed Nicholas Paget-Brown's decision to stand down, but said public trust could not be restored by other members of the council. He said residents ""quite rightly feel desperately neglected"". Mr Paget-Brown resigned on Friday, saying he had to accept his ""share of responsibility for perceived failings"". At least 80 people are believed to have died as fire engulfed the Grenfell Tower block, in west London, on 14 June. Cladding 'changed to cheaper version' How flammable cladding gets approved What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Mr Paget-Brownresigned following sustained criticism of the counciland an aborted meeting of its cabinet on Thursday, from which leaders had tried to ban members of the public and press. The decision led to a rebuke from Downing Street, which said it would have expected the council to respect a High Court ruling that the meeting be open to the public. Reacting to Mr Paget-Brown's resignation, Mr Khan said it had been ""clear that the local community in and around North Kensington has lost trust in the council and that the administration is not fit for purpose"". Six questions for the investigation A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower He called on the prime minister to appoint ""untainted"" commissioners with ""a genuine empathy for local people and the situation they face"" to take over the running of the council until the next local council elections. Yvette Williams, co-ordinator of the Justice4Grenfell campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the community was ""very, very angry"" and would not accept commissioners without consultation. ""I do support the mayor in terms of a commissioner-led borough, but how are those people going to be selected?"" she said. She added that one former Grenfell Tower resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the tragedy. The survivor, who is housed in a hotel, got her bank card back and only realised that the rent had been taken when she went to withdraw funds from a cash point, Ms Williams said. ""It's just disgusting,"" she added. Kensington and Chelsea council said to the best of its knowledge rent charges for Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk had been stopped. ""We are very sorry if this has happened and we are working to find out who has been affected so we can offer reassurance and an immediate refund,"" a council statement said. ""But if anyone has had money inadvertently taken as part of a direct debit or standing order we will make arrangements to have it immediately refunded."" Residents condemned the response to the tragedy, calling it ""absolute chaos"" as relief efforts on the ground were limited. They said there was little or no co-ordination in the immediate days after the disaster, with claims council officials were nowhere to be seen. The council was accused of failing to provide enough support or information to those who had been made homeless. It tried to hold the first cabinet meeting since the disaster behind closed doors. After a High Court order ruled it should be open to the public, the council adjourned the meeting after 20 minutes, claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the inquiry. Catherine Faulks, Conservative councillor for Kensington and Chelsea council, said: ""Of course we weren't immediately quick off the ground, it was an enormous tragedy... I challenge any borough in the whole country to immediately have had an action plan that they could put into place."" When asked whether commissioners should take over the council, she said: ""It's a decision for government."" The council will elect a leader next week, she said. But shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he backed Mr Khan's call because the council had ""demonstrated they are not up to the job"". ""The public and residents' trust can't be restored by simply replacing the leader and deputy leader by other politicians from the same political group and this is where ministers need to step in,"" he said. This video can not be played Nick Paget-Brown: ""I have to accept my share of responsibility"" The former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, a cross-bench peer, told Today  commissioners were ""not brought in lightly"" and it had ""only happened on very few occasions"". ""The test for me about whether commissioners come in - I wouldn't like to make that judgement not being close to the detail - is really, essentially, can the council do the job that is necessary to make the building safe and in particular to support those who have been affected?"" he said. ""The pace of response has been the issue and also I have to say the communication. The public have a right to know what's going on."" Council leaders claimed on Thursday that an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry into the disaster. But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a ""fiasco"". In his resignation statement, Mr Paget-Brown said he had received legal advice not to ""compromise"" the public inquiry into the fire by having the meeting open to the public and press. But he added this decision ""has itself become a political story"". ""It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or still unaccounted for,"" he said. This video can not be played Council tries to ban press and public from meeting Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the resignation was a ""personal matter"" for Mr Paget-Brown, but added that it was ""right that he has stepped aside"". Deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, property and regeneration, Rock Feilding-Mellen, also stood down. The fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington destroyed 151 homes, both in the tower and surrounding areas. Documents obtained by the BBCsuggest cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, which was less fire resistant. The tower's cladding has been the focus of attention, amid suggestions it was why the flames spread so quickly. Meanwhile, the head of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation has stepped aside so he can focus on ""assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". Did you live in Grenfell Tower?

"There is concern for Andy Murray and his hip injury in the papers The fallout from the Grenfell Tower tragedy continues to occupy many of the front pages. The Times,externalsays Kensington and Chelsea council has been ""thrown into chaos"" after the resignation of its leader Nicholas Paget-Brown and his deputy. Britain's richest borough is now ""rudderless"", says the paper, ""with hundreds of people still homeless."" The Sun says the men were forced to step aside afterNumber 10 ""demanded their heads"",external. Sources tell the paper that Mr Paget-Brown was told by the London minister, Greg Hands, that the government had no confidence in him after his ""catastrophically poor handling"" of the disaster. In its editorial, The Sundecries what it calls the ""shameful behaviour"" of the ""rotten"" council,externaland says the time has come for it to be taken over by government commissioners. The Mirror,externalremarks that a ""sneering"" Mr Paget-Brown has ""still failed to apologise"" in the wake of the authorities' disastrous response to the tragedy. In its editorial, the paper says Kensington and Chelsea has become ""the most reviled borough in Britain for its callous mishandling of the survivors"". It too calls for the government to take over the running of the council. The i says there is a""deadly"" new tower block risk,external. The paper reports that police have warned that insulation in tower blocks is just as flammable as the cladding that is thought to have contributed to the spread of the Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 80 are believed to have died. The Telegraph,externalsays business sources are warning Theresa May that she risks ""crippling the economy"" if The City of London is neglected in Brexit talks. Senior figures have told the paper that financial services are ""the backbone of the economy"" and must be at the forefront of negotiations. They fear the prime minister is prioritising other industries - such as manufacturing - which employ fewer people and raise less tax. It would be ""madness"", the Telegraph argues, ""for Britain to shoot itself in the foot because of popular ignorance about what the City does"". The Express has other concerns. The paper says Brussels has issued what it callsan ""outrageous"" demand,externalfor ""vast swathes"" of Britain's post-Brexit rules to be decided by the European Court of Justice. A spokesman for the Brexit department tells the paper that ending the court's direct jurisdiction over British laws is ""a red line in the negotiations"". There is much speculation about the direction of Labour's strategy on Brexit, after the party's leader,  Jeremy Corbyn, sacked three members of his front bench for voting in favour of keeping Britain in the single market and customs union. The shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has told theMirror,externalthat the party plans to block a hard withdrawal from the EU. He says the party will push for a ""transition arrangement"", which would extend the talks and avoid the ""cliff edge"" if a deal is not reached by the March 2019 deadline. The Times reports on what it says is the first""care-home nursery"",externalin Britain. It says a nursery and home for the elderly are to be located on the same site in Clapham, in south-west London. The move, says the paper, is designed to tackle the ""age apartheid that increasingly keeps generations apart"". Thirty children a day will attend the nursery - with young and old taking part in activities together, including singing, cooking, gardening and story-telling. The Sun reports on the extraordinary antics ofArnie the tortoise,external, who has been reunited with his owners two years after going missing. The adventurous reptile was discovered wandering up the driveway of his owners' former home in Shropshire, even though he had never lived there. The property was just a mile from his owners' current home, where the tortoise had been living. Tortoises are known to have well-developed homing instincts. But the Sun has a far simpler explanation for this remarkable feat - concluding that he must be ""Shellapathic"". There is anxiety in many papers that Andy Murray's hip injury could thwart his Wimbledon ambitions. But the Sun offers a possible solution ahead of his first match on Monday. It asks readers toplace their hands on an image of the player,externalat precisely 15:40 BST on Saturday and send him all their positive energy. The timing has a special significance, says the paper, as it matches the ""coveted score"" for a double break point.

"Die Toten Hosen in 1989 When music captures the spirit of freedom it can cross any border. In 1961, Communist East Germany built a wall across Berlin, and tried to seal itself off from the West. But new research shows how concrete, barbed wire and a huge effort by the secret police, the Stasi, failed to silence the seductive beat of rock and roll and punk. The rise of Beatlemania in the 1960s brought a scathing response from Walter Ulbricht, the leader of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). ""Do we really have to copy all the rubbish that comes from the Westâ¦ with all the monotony of their 'Yeah, yeah, yeah,'"" he sneered during one of his turgid speeches to the Communist Party faithful. He was 70 years old and in some ways his comments weren't so different from those of many Western politicians, says Dagmar Hovestaedt, a senior figure at the BStU, the organisation investigating the archives of the East German secret police, the Stasi. ""The older generation, the war generation, was aghast at what youth was doing,"" she says. But for East Germany's leaders, much more was at stake. They feared that love of Western music would lead to love of Western politics. So they desperately tried to develop ""their own version of cool youth culture"". There were state-planned dance steps, such as the Lipsi, an attempt to prevent the rise of rock and roll dancing. There was also a ludicrous and much ignored quota system restricting how much Western music could be played at parties. But ""you can't organise a youth culture,"" Hovestaedt says. ""That's not how it works."" Which is why many young East Germans remained glued to their radios, trying to catch the latest tunes beamed in by Western stations, and the Stasi did what it could to stop them. Listen toRocking the Stasion Music Extra, on the BBC World Service Click herefor transmission times, or to catch up later online If there's one story that symbolises GDR paranoia about music - and the tragedy of being a young music fan there - it's the story of a Rolling Stones concert that never happened. It all began in 1969 with a throwaway comment by a DJ on the radio station RIAS - based in West Berlin but much listened to on the other side of the Berlin Wall. Imagine, he said, if the new publishing house built by entrepreneur Axel Springer in the West, right next to the Wall, staged a concert featuring the Stones on its roof so Easterners could come and listen too. Stasi photographs of crowds in East Berlin gathering to hear the Rolling Stones In East Germany the DJ's notion quickly became rumour and then widely believed fact. Thousands of young East Germans convinced themselves that the Stones really would play. And, what's more, on the same day their rulers were planning a day of celebrations in East Berlin to mark the 20th anniversary of the GDR's founding. Cue panic among the Stasi. They hated Springer - seen as a capitalist ogre bent on luring young people away from the communist faith. Their files from the time are full of things like photographs of slogans chalked on roads in East German towns telling Stones fans to come to Berlin - and reports detailing how the Stasi tracked down and arrested the subversive sloganisers. But hundreds did still come to Berlin on the day. I met Eckart Mann, then a 16-year-old, at the same spot opposite the Springer building where he'd waited in 1969. He'd heard the rumour, and thought, ""Stones, play here. Wow, wow, wow!"" In fact, the Stones never appeared, but the GDR authorities did. As the crowd moved towards the Brandenburg Gate the policed arrived, and Mann was beaten and arrested. He was convicted of being an ""anti-socialist element"". In his files I discovered that the head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke, had taken a personal interest in his case. Mann was given two years in prison, then expelled to the West, away from his family. Eckart Mann, near the spot where he was arrested 48 years ago ""What was prison like?"" I ask. He shrugged. ""Not OK, but what could I do?"" he says. And so a teenager paid a bitter price for his love of music. That kind of brutal reprisal was meant to deter all young East Germans from dancing to Western ""imperialist"" tunes. But the hunger for Western music just grew - reaching places a long way from the big cities. Young people suspected of listening to Western music, secretly snapped by the Stasi (1969) Another teenager, Alexander Kuehne, was desperate to bring more music into his life in a remote village hours from Berlin. What about getting hold of the latest Western records? As pensioners  - not seen as vital to the state - were allowed by the GDR regime to visit the West, he'd give his grandmother shopping lists. It didn't go well. She misread The Clash and came back with Johnny Cash - you can still see the pain in Alexander's face as he recalls this ""huge nightmare"". So instead he decided to turn his village into a major music venue. It happened to be near a major rail junction, and he persuaded all kinds of music fans and bands to head for the room behind the village pub. ""This place is where we made the biggest parties in East Germany,"" he says, as he shows me round. Farmers at the bar would look on bemused as hundreds of New Wave fans or Glamrockers headed past them - with up to 1,000 packing a hall meant, according to police regulations, to hold only 100. As it was so remote the police and Stasi were slow to react to these huge gatherings - apart from on one occasion when Alexander was arrested, taken to a police station and told the Stasi would come for him the next day. ""I was very frightened,"" he says. Alexander Kuehne in the pub today Luckily for him his mother had once taught the local police officer. She ordered him to release her son, and then dealt with the Stasi when they arrived. She never told her son exactly what happened. ""She's my hero"" is all he says now, with quiet admiration. But back in the big cities pressure from the Stasi was relentless on music fans seen as ""subversive"" and ""anti-social"". I remember visiting East Berlin in the early 1980s, seeing a few punks on the streets, and thinking you've got to be brave wearing slashed clothes, safety pins and spiky hair when the regime wanted you parading in a socialist youth group uniform. Berlin's Stasi Museum displays the police mugshot of an arrested punk But how could the secret police deal with or even understand something like punk? The archives contain recordings of Stasi meetings where the organisation's boss Erich Mielke tried to get his brain - and his tongue - around such utterly baffling concepts as punks and heavy metal fans. I managed to track down JÃ¼rgen Breski, then a Stasi officer ordered to monitor and infiltrate the punk scene. He agreed to meet in a discreet corner of a city-centre restaurant and tell me what his bosses had wanted him to do. ""They wanted to bring a kind of socialist lifestyle to the people so we tried to combat anything that didn't belong to that,"" he says. ""The aim was to control 'the scene' as it expanded, to stop it from becoming too well known."" In the end the Stasi did what it always did -recruited as many informers as possible. Other tactics including calling up members of illegal bands for compulsory military service and sending them to different parts of the country. ""Suddenly the band had no musicians,"" Breski says. An outdoor punk concert in East Berlin (1985) But many were determined to resist. Dirk Kalinowski from the punk band Zerfall told me how the Stasi put heavy pressure on him and his band. They survived as performers thanks to an extraordinary alliance with a Berlin church which gave them shelter. The GDR authorities, mostly ruthless, were wary of attracting international attention by interfering directly with church activities. The church, he says, was a ""protected space"". ""They could arrest you as you arrived in front of the door or as you left.  But here inside you were safe."" So his group - banned by the state from normal concerts - was able to perform in the middle of Evangelical church services. The pastor would pauseâ¦ and then ask his mostly elderly congregation to listen to something just a bit different. ""It was mad,"" Kalinowski remembers. ""As front man I could see right into the faces of the congregation who were completely shocked. The only ones who were laid back about it were the children who jumped up straight away. I'll never forget it - one old couple covered their ears and then walked out."" A church also provided the venue for another extraordinary concert, when British music producer Mark Reeder managed to smuggle a West German punk band, Die Toten Hosen, across the Berlin Wall to play a concert. Mark Reeder before the fall of the Wall ""I told my friends, 'If I get caught I get thrown out of the country. If you get caught your lives will change because you'll be classed as enemies of the state,'"" recalls Reeder. ""They said, 'We don't care we'll do it anyway.'"" Campino, lead singer of Die Toten Hosen, remembers how the band disguised themselves to get through border controls between West and East Berlin. ""We had to comb our hair, get proper clothes on."" He knew why the East German authorities would stop them if they recognised them. ""Punk rock didn't officially exist in the East, they didn't want to spread the virus in any form."" Only around 25 could come to the secret concert in an East Berlin church.  But ""everyone in the room know this was something very special and maybe would never happen again"". Campino performing with the Toten Hosen in 2015 He was very impressed, he says, with the way young East Germans created their own cultural space in spite of - or perhaps because of - all the regime's pressure. ""They had a certain kind of pride, a belief. They said, 'You in the West you've got the best clothing, the fashion, all those things. But we've got friendship and we help each other and we're not superficial,'"" he says. Their friendships ""meant more because they had to pay a bigger price for everything that went wrong"", as he puts it. And so this amazing musical life rocked on - soundtrack to a kind of freedom that few outsiders ever realised was possible. Yes, the regimes could impose all kinds of restrictions. But still music fans created free spaces, a unique state of mind across communist-ruled Europe. Mikhail Gorbachev and East German leader Erich Honecker sing the International in East Berlin (1986) From the mid-1980s, as a new leader in Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev, began loosening the Soviet grip on East Germany, Western music was reverberating more and more strongly around the Berlin Wall itself. In 1987 no less a figure than David Bowie played a concert right by the Wall on the Western side - Bowie a global star who'd lived in Berlin, knew its surreal Cold War atmosphere and musical energy well. And fans from the East gathered near the Wall to try and listen. For the relatively young deputy police chief of East Berlin, Dieter Dietze, this posed a professional and personal dilemma. He knew a brutal police response - like that against those who'd come hoping to hear the Rolling Stones in 1969 - would be counter-productive. And as a rock fan himself who'd once played in a band, he told me he had much sympathy with the young fans. But GDR bosses still wanted order above all. ""It was clear to me that music, rock music belonged to young people, that there was no way you could deny that to young people. So I and a couple of others began to argue - why don't we do something like this?"" he says. The GDR authorities were persuaded to allow concerts on their territory by global superstars including Bob Dylan and, in 1988, Bruce Springsteen. It was meant as a safety valve to appease the younger generation. But the concerts just amplified a new spirit of freedom. A Stasi report on the Dylan concert struggles with the name of Tom Petty's band Concerts like Bruce Springsteen's, says Dagmar Hovestaedt, ""became a rallying point for demands for human rights, for access to travel and to express yourself. Imagine - 100,000 young East Germans singing 'Born in the USA'."" Whereas in the 1960s Rolling Stones fans hoping to hear their heroes had faced persecution, ""in the 80s that fear had gone, the state had lost control"". There are many reasons, political and economic, why the Cold War came to an end. But that spirit of freedom that brought thousands on the streets in 1989 to challenge communist regimes was also vital. And that spirit had been sustained - for many - by music. After the Wall came down and the GDR disappeared so too did the Stasi. Former officers like JÃ¼rgen Breski have had much time to reflect on their attempt to control everything - and why it failed. ""From today's perceptive much seems pointless, a waste of effort,"" he told me. When it came to punk music ""sometimes we had influence, but in the end there were no results"" . And what about the young people persecuted, sometimes imprisoned, for their love of music? ""Today I'd be against doing something like that. But you grow up in a society, grow with this society's norms, you profit from them. And when later you have the chance to see that from a different perspective you say: 'OK - it shouldn't have been that way.'"" Concrete borders, machine guns and barbed wire could stop some things. But not music. ""Music comes into your spirit and your head and you listen,"" says Dagmar Hovestaedt. For her, it all goes back to an old German proverb:Die Gedanken sind frei- thoughts are free. ""Music that can't be stopped by borders reminds you constantly there is joy in self-expression.""

"The NHS runs campaigns to encourage donors to register - but rules differ across the UK How you decide what happens to your organs after death depends on where you live in the UK. So what is the current system and what might change? People in Scotland are set toautomatically become organ donorsunless they opt out - following a similarmove introduced in Wales in 2015. The change has for now been rejected in England and Northern Ireland, which instead relies on public awareness campaigns. Three people in the UK die a day in need of donors, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. This is despite an all-time high in registered donors, with23.4 million,externalpeople - or 36% of Britons - on the organ register. The ""soft"" opt-out system planned for Scotland means parts of an adult's body can be used in transplants - unless they have opted out. Families and next of kin can still veto the removal of organs. So-called ""deemed consent"" has been the system in Wales since December 2015, where 6% of the population has chosen to opt out. One year on in Wales, 39 organs were transplanted through deemed consent out of a total of 160 transplants. But deemed consent does not apply to certain people including children and those who lack the capacity to understand the system. Supporters said Scotland's move was a ""landmark moment"" and the UK government has hinted at the possibility of a future change in England. Currently in England and Northern Ireland, people must join theNHS Organ Donor Register,externalor their family or close friends must give consent before their organs can be used. No 10 said it was ""keeping a close eye on the implications of the policy change in Wales and Scotland"", in reaction to a newspaper campaign to alter the rules across the UK. ""Max Johnson is nine and needs a new heart,"" the Daily Mirror said on its front page on Friday, adding that opt-out would ""give him and thousands of others a far, far greater chance of life"". Although organ donation did not feature prominently in this year's general election, politicians have previously voiced their support for opt-out. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has argued that many people want to donate - but forget to sign up. But some Conservatives, including the Welsh Conservatives' shadow health minister Darren Millar, have criticised the opt-out policy, saying it wasnot a ""silver bullet"" solution. Church leaders have also expressed concerns about opt-out, saying that donating organs should be seen as a free gift. But most major faith groups - Christians and Muslims included - have expressed support for the principles of donation. Deemed consent has so far been rejected as a UK-wide policy. In 2008, a task force set up by the Labour government rejected opt-out for the time being - saying it could put donors off or erode people's trust in doctors. While it did not rule out opt-out, it suggested a Â£4.5m public awareness campaign instead - adding that families get an emotional benefit from ""choosing"" to donate their deceased relative's organs. In Northern Ireland, senior clinicians have argued thateducating the public to sign up to donatewas the best way forward. With 23.4 million Britons registered, registered donor numbers have increased every year since 2012 - and are 20% higher than five years ago. Mr Mashford in hospital after a 13-hour heart transplant operation Kevin Mashford, 40, waited a year to receive a life-saving heart transplant and thinks opt-out is the fairer system. ""If you're willing to receive someone's organs to save your life, why not be willing to donate?"" he said. Mr Mashford, an architect from Bristol, was born with a rare heart disease but in 2013, aged 36, he had final stage heart failure and was told he had six months to live. ""The doctors told me to see my family and sort out my affairs,"" he said. ""I waited at home for that year, waiting for news"". He said he was saved in the ""nick of time"" after going to hospital with multiple organ failure just six weeks before he found a donor. ""I was lucky in a way, they put me on an urgent Europe-wide list,"" he said. There were 6,402 people on waiting lists for organ transplants in December 2016, according to the NHS. Whether the system is opt-in or opt-out, Mr Mashford urged people to tell their family their wishes. ""Hospitals also have a moral obligation, and if a mum doesn't know if their son is registered and objects to donation, it can be difficult to question that,"" he said. Mr Mashford later found out his heart donor was a keen cyclist and began riding in his memory. ""After I recovered, I cycled seven minutes for seven days and I haven't looked back. Since then, with my donors name inscribed in my helmet, I have taken part in a number of long distance cycle rides for charity."" Marlon Yearwood as Cameron in Pig Heart Boy, a drama about a boy whose heart is failing The rise in donations follows efforts by celebrities and public health officials to encourage people to donate, and donation has become more prominent in popular culture. The NHS runs social media campaigns and makes posters encouraging people to donate. In 2015, it recruited Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing and Olympic medallist Jade Jones to make their own dating profiles on the app Tinder, where they sent a message to users asking them to donate. Others may remember the BBC's That's Life! documentary in the early 1980s, which featured an appeal by the parents of two-year-old Ben Hardwick. Their wait for a liver transplant earned him celebrity status. He got the transplant but later died in hospital. In 1999, the award-winning children's book Pig Heart Boy by Malorie Blackman, about a boy with heart failure, was adapted into a children's television series. As Scotland's Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said this week, there has been a ""long-term culture change in attitudes"" among Britons towards donating organs.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong's skyline was lit up with fireworks Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned against ""impermissible"" challenges to Beijing's authority over Hong Kong. Mr Xi was speaking at the swearing-in of the territory's new leaderCarrie Lam, as Hong Kong marked 20 years since its handover to China from Britain. On Saturday afternoon, after Mr Xi had left Hong Kong, thousands of people took part in an annual march calling for greater democracy. During Mr Xi's visit there was little opportunity for protest. An earlier protest had led to clashes with pro-Beijing demonstrators. Mr Xi's visit to the city - his first since becoming Chinese leader in 2013 - came amid tight police security. Several people were detained in the morning, when a small group of pro-democracy activists clashed with pro-Beijing demonstrators close to the site where the lavish ceremony took place. Organisers said 60,000 people took part in the later pro-democracy march, though police said the figure was much lower. Heavy rain affected the march, which started at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. Some protesters carried yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the demonstrations which gripped the city in 2014. Lam Wing-kee, one of the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing in 2015 and re-surfaced in detention on the mainland, addressed the march. One protester carried a cardboard cut-out of President Xi carrying a yellow umbrella The Chinese leader oversaw the swearing in of Ms Lam, the newly-elected chief executive of the territory, along with the rest of her cabinet. She is Hong Kong's first female leader. In a speech he said that Hong Kong needed to ""improve its systems to uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests"". ""Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government... or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible,"" he said. Beijing's struggle to win HK's young hearts Chris Patten: HK democracy cannot be ignored Why Britain returned Hong Kong to China He added that Hong Kong now enjoyed more freedom than ever before. But while the territory's Basic Law guarantees wide-ranging freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, Beijing's refusal to grant universal suffrage has triggered sometimes violent unrest. In Saturday morning's small-scale protests, pro-democracy party Demosisto said police had arrested five of its members, and four members from the League of Social Democrats. This video can not be played One protester gets caught up in a scuffle with police Among those said by the group to have been arrested was Joshua Wong, the leader of the so-calledumbrella protest movement. It was meant to be a routine demonstration by pro-democracy protesters. The leaders of the League of Social Democrats and Demosisto had gathered to make their way to the square in the Wanchai district where the flag-raising ceremony was taking place. They were demanding greater voting rights for Hong Kong, as well the immediate release of theChinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. But without warning, scuffles began between the demonstrators and the police. Faces were slammed to the ground. And then pro-Beijing supporters turned up, waving flags and blaring patriotic music. Each side was shouting abuse at the other. The tussle went on for more than an hour, with it ending only after the leaders of the pro-democracy demonstration were led away by police, who called it an illegal gathering. During the ceremony, the flags of China and Hong Kong were raised alongside one another to mark the 20-year anniversary of the city's handover of British rule. Helicopters flew overhead as onlookers cheered at the ceremony in Golden Bauhinia Square, central Hong Kong. On Friday, an official protest zone near the convention centre where Mr Xi was guest of honour at an anniversary banquet and variety performance was heavily patrolled, as demonstrators gathered chanting ""end one-party dictatorship"". Carrie Lam shakes hands with President Xi after swearing an oath of office in Hong Kong Helicopters pass the flags of China and Hong Kong at Golden Bauhinia Square There is growing concern that the Chinese central government is undermining Hong Kong's more politically liberal traditions, despite its promise to give it a high degree of autonomy. Joshua Wong and 25 other activists were arrested on Wednesday for ""breaking the 'public nuisance' law,external"" after climbing into a golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower, Hong Kong's emblem.

"London's mayor has urged Theresa May to appoint commissioners to run Kensington and Chelsea council after its leader resigned over the Grenfell Tower fire. Sadiq Khan welcomed Nicholas Paget-Brown's decision to stand down, but said public trust could not be restored by other members of the council. He said residents ""quite rightly feel desperately neglected"". Mr Paget-Brown resigned on Friday, saying he had to accept his ""share of responsibility for perceived failings"". At least 80 people are believed to have died as fire engulfed the Grenfell Tower block, in west London, on 14 June. Cladding 'changed to cheaper version' How flammable cladding gets approved What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Mr Paget-Brownresigned following sustained criticism of the counciland an aborted meeting of its cabinet on Thursday, from which leaders had tried to ban members of the public and press. The decision led to a rebuke from Downing Street, which said it would have expected the council to respect a High Court ruling that the meeting be open to the public. Reacting to Mr Paget-Brown's resignation, Mr Khan said it had been ""clear that the local community in and around North Kensington has lost trust in the council and that the administration is not fit for purpose"". Six questions for the investigation A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower He called on the prime minister to appoint ""untainted"" commissioners with ""a genuine empathy for local people and the situation they face"" to take over the running of the council until the next local council elections. Yvette Williams, co-ordinator of the Justice4Grenfell campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the community was ""very, very angry"" and would not accept commissioners without consultation. ""I do support the mayor in terms of a commissioner-led borough, but how are those people going to be selected?"" she said. She added that one former Grenfell Tower resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the tragedy. The survivor, who is housed in a hotel, got her bank card back and only realised that the rent had been taken when she went to withdraw funds from a cash point, Ms Williams said. ""It's just disgusting,"" she added. Kensington and Chelsea council said to the best of its knowledge rent charges for Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk had been stopped. ""We are very sorry if this has happened and we are working to find out who has been affected so we can offer reassurance and an immediate refund,"" a council statement said. ""But if anyone has had money inadvertently taken as part of a direct debit or standing order we will make arrangements to have it immediately refunded."" Residents condemned the response to the tragedy, calling it ""absolute chaos"" as relief efforts on the ground were limited. They said there was little or no co-ordination in the immediate days after the disaster, with claims council officials were nowhere to be seen. The council was accused of failing to provide enough support or information to those who had been made homeless. It tried to hold the first cabinet meeting since the disaster behind closed doors. After a High Court order ruled it should be open to the public, the council adjourned the meeting after 20 minutes, claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the inquiry. Catherine Faulks, Conservative councillor for Kensington and Chelsea council, said: ""Of course we weren't immediately quick off the ground, it was an enormous tragedy... I challenge any borough in the whole country to immediately have had an action plan that they could put into place."" When asked whether commissioners should take over the council, she said: ""It's a decision for government."" The council will elect a leader next week, she said. But shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he backed Mr Khan's call because the council had ""demonstrated they are not up to the job"". ""The public and residents' trust can't be restored by simply replacing the leader and deputy leader by other politicians from the same political group and this is where ministers need to step in,"" he said. This video can not be played Nick Paget-Brown: ""I have to accept my share of responsibility"" The former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, a cross-bench peer, told Today  commissioners were ""not brought in lightly"" and it had ""only happened on very few occasions"". ""The test for me about whether commissioners come in - I wouldn't like to make that judgement not being close to the detail - is really, essentially, can the council do the job that is necessary to make the building safe and in particular to support those who have been affected?"" he said. ""The pace of response has been the issue and also I have to say the communication. The public have a right to know what's going on."" Council leaders claimed on Thursday that an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry into the disaster. But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a ""fiasco"". In his resignation statement, Mr Paget-Brown said he had received legal advice not to ""compromise"" the public inquiry into the fire by having the meeting open to the public and press. But he added this decision ""has itself become a political story"". ""It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or still unaccounted for,"" he said. This video can not be played Council tries to ban press and public from meeting Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the resignation was a ""personal matter"" for Mr Paget-Brown, but added that it was ""right that he has stepped aside"". Deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, property and regeneration, Rock Feilding-Mellen, also stood down. The fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington destroyed 151 homes, both in the tower and surrounding areas. Documents obtained by the BBCsuggest cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, which was less fire resistant. The tower's cladding has been the focus of attention, amid suggestions it was why the flames spread so quickly. Meanwhile, the head of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation has stepped aside so he can focus on ""assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". Did you live in Grenfell Tower?

"Ascension Lopez says she has found documents indicating that her adoption was illegal ""Even if I go to jail, I will remain freer than those who are prisoners of their own lies,"" says AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez, who faces five months in prison for slandering a nun. ""They cannot take away what I know in my mind."" Lopez is too poor to pay â¬40,000 (Â£35,000; $46,000) in damages after a court ruled she had wrongly accused the nun of taking her from her biological mother and handing her to ageing adoptive parents in 1962. If the government does not pardon her, the 55-year-old will be the first person to be jailed over Spain's enormous baby-snatching racket stemming from the Franco era. Protesters have presented a 30,000-strong petition to Spain's justice ministry calling for her to be let off. ""I have a bone-wasting disease, I have not been able to work for three years and my two children are unemployed and have no contact with their father,"" a tearful  LÃ³pez told the BBC. According to LÃ³pez, her adoptive father, a senior figure in Gen Francisco Franco's regime in Almeria whose marriage was barren, bought her for 250,000 pesetas (about â¬50,000, Â£44,000 , $57,000 in today's money) via his niece, Dolores Baena, a nun working in a Seville hospital at the time. Her father was 67, and her new mother around 60.  Dolores became her cousin. When she was eight, she came home from school to find local dignitaries in her parents' bedroom. Before her lay her father's body. He had suffered a stroke and died. ""I went to my room to cry, and a member of the family came to see me and asked why I was crying for that man who had nothing to do with me, but had only bought me when I was a new-born."" Ascension's adoptive father died when she was eight Asking for information from her mother and relatives, LÃ³pez began to suspect there was something not quite right about her adoption, long before the issue of babies being stolen from poor or politically suspect parents became a public issue in Spain. Spain's stolen babies and the families who lived a lie Spain to open 'stolen' baby archives Spain call to probe 'baby thefts' Nun in Spain 'baby theft' hearing For a start, she had different names on the various bits of paperwork that confirmed her identity. On the first sheet from the Seville hospital nursery where she was kept for a few days, she was called Consuelo. As a small child, her name was MarÃ­a Dolores - ""I was always Loli at home"" - but her first identity card named her officially as MarÃ­a AscensiÃ³n. ""Whatever happened to my mother, I am very clear that my identity was stolen."" AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez believes she was bought by a senior figure in Gen Francisco Franco's regime LÃ³pez asked the nun, her cousin, if she could help her trace her background. ""She told me that, try as she might, I would never find my biological parents. When I was 15 she took me to an orphanage in Almeria and showed me all the babies there. 'If we hadn't done what we did for you, you'd have been left alone, like these children with no family'."" LÃ³pez's investigation has uncovered an adoption sheet signed by Sister Dolores, but the Seville authorities cannot find any document in which her biological mother surrendered her child. As an activist and president of SOS Stolen Babies AlmerÃ­a, representing other possible victims of the stolen baby scandal that stretches over half a century from the 1930s to the 1990s, LÃ³pez spoke of her case in the media, naming Sister Dolores as the person who ""organised"" her illegal adoption. The nun sued her cousin for defamation, winning a 2015 trial. LÃ³pez was ordered to pay a â¬3,000 fine, plus â¬40,000 in damages to Sister Dolores and costs. No documents have been found indicating that AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez was given up by her birth mother During the trial, Sister Dolores declared: ""There was nobody behind the adoption; it was all legal and nobody charged any money."" The judge said AscensiÃ³n LÃ³pez had utterly failed to prove that her adoption had been illegally carried out by her cousin and had falsely accused her. Sister Dolores did not reply to requests by the BBC to comment for this article. LÃ³pez admits she may have been ""careless"" in her wording when accusing the nun, but feels let down by the legal system. ""I was judged as a daughter, as a mother and as a woman; my whole life was put on trial."" Estimates of the number of cases of stolen babies in Spain range from 30,000 to 300,000. This video can not be played Manoli Pagador told the BBC in 2011 how her baby son was taken away from her in 1971 Almost all of thousands of cases reported to the courts have led nowhere. But later this year, Eduardo Vela, an 82-year-old Madrid gynaecologist, is due to become the first person to go on trial accused of baby snatching. LÃ³pez, who cared for her adoptive mother before she died in 1990, says that she too has fallen into bad health and economic ruin. She suffers from a rare bone condition and an inherited blood disorder. ""They have erased my memories. I look at my son and wonder who he looks like. I look at my daughter and wonder if she could have the same disease as me because it's genetically transmitted. ""I just wonder what happened and how did I end up here?"" 2008: Investigating judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n writes that 30,000 children were stolen from families considered politically suspect by the Franco regime after the 1936-39 civil war Thousands of possible victims come forward and new associations are formed demanding justice and help in finding lost relatives in an estimated 200,000 cases Some 2,000 reported cases of alleged stolen children have been reported but prosecutors have closed all but a handful of investigations 2013: Maria Gomez Valbuena, an 87-year-old nun facing two charges of kidnapping and falsifying documents, dies before going on trial May 2017: UK MEP Jade Kirton-Darling announces that Spain's Catholic Church and health ministry have promised to open their archives to help those possibly affected by child snatching in the country's hospitals.
