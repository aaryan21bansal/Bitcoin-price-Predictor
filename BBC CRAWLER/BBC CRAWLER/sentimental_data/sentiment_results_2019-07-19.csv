"This video can not be played Rory McIlroy turns on the style in remarkable cut chase at the Open The 148th Open Championship - second-round leaderboard -8JB Holmes (US), S Lowry (Ire);-7L Westwood (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng);-6C Smith (Aus), J Harding (SA), J Rose (Eng);-5B Koepka (US), J Spieth (US), A Puttnam (US), D Frittelli (SA) Selected others:-4J Rahm (Spa);-3T Hatton (Eng), D Johnson (US), R Fowler (US);-2E Els J Day (SA);-1D Willett (Eng);EF Molinari (Ita);+2R McIlroy (NI)+6T Woods (US);+7I Poulter (Eng);+8P Mickelson (US) Rory McIlroy agonisingly missed the cut at his home Open as Ireland's Shane Lowry produced a four-under-par 67 to take a share of the lead. McIlroy's 79 on Thursday left him eight shots shy of the cut at one over, and he almost achieved his feat but failed to pick up a birdie at the last. Lowry, 32, is on eight under alongside USA's JB Holmes, with England's Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood a shot back. Another Englishman, Justin Rose, is on six under after a 67 at Royal Portrush. World number one Brooks Koepka and 2017 Open champion Jordan Spieth are a shot further back on five under, but former winners Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Darren Clarke all missed the cut. It is the first time both Woods and Mickelson have gone out of the same major after the first two rounds. I felt the crowd's love - emotional McIlroy 'I'm not consistent anymore' - Woods Open leaderboard after second round The crowd following McIlroy around the County Antrim course began to grow in size as he sank birdie after birdie on the inward nine. By the 18th the cheer that greeted the 2014 champion was as if he was going for his second title rather than a mission to make the cut. However, his hopes faded with his approach to the green as the wind took the ball down the bank. The following chip landed wide and ended the 30-year-old's hopes of winning a major on home soil. ""Part of me is very disappointed not to be here for the weekend. I'm emotional but happy with how I played,"" said McIlroy. ""The support I got out there was incredible and you could see on the back nine, I went with it today and that's what I was planning to do all week. ""Yesterday gave me a mountain to climb but I dug in and showed good resilience. ""It's going to hurt for a bit. I've been looking forward to this week for a long time. ""I didn't play my part but everyone in Northern Ireland came out to watch me and played theirs."" Relive live coverage of the Open's second day Full BBC TV and radio coverage times This video can not be played 'Birdie, birdie, birdie!' - Lowryâs lightning start It has been quite an eventful 12 months for Lowry who has risen to from world number 90 to 33 following victory in Abu Dhabi in January and an eighth place at the US PGA. His best performance at a major to date was tied second at the 2016 US Open. However, he is now targeting his first major. ""I'm obviously going to be thinking about it tonight,"" he said when asked about the prospect of winning the Claret Jug. ""There's no point in shying away from it. I'm in a great position but, my goodness, have we got a long way to go. ""As a golfer you have such a long career. I've been 10 years now and it's just a rollercoaster. I think the reason I'm so good mentally now is I know - I think - how to take the downs."" Clarke, who got the 148th Open under way, will also miss the weekend after he finished on three over. However, Graeme McDowell, born a short distance from the course, managed to sneak through on one over as did last year's champion Francesco Molinari, who carded a 69. The Cut podcast: It's all about the cut This video can not be played Spieth surges up leaderboard with three birdies and an eagle Unlike McIlroy, three-time winner and current Masters champion Woods never looked like making the cut, and finished on six over. It is only the third time in 21 attempts the 15-time major winner has not made the weekend at The Open, and only the 10th time in majors he has missed the cut. Seven of those have come in the past 13 tournaments. Fellow American and 2013 champion Mickelson ended his campaign with a 74 for eight over. Former champions Paul Lawrie and Padraig Harrington also missed the cut, as did European Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter. Another former winner, David Duval, ended his sorry campaign on 27 over after he followed Thursday's 91 with a 78. The biggest challenge to a European win might come from world number one Koepka and Spieth, who are both on five under. American Koepka, seeking his fifth major in two years, followed Thursday's 68 with a 69, and compatriot Spieth produced an eagle on the par-five seventh on his way to a 67. Australia's Cameron Smith and Justin Harding are among those in contention, on six under. This video can not be played Fast-finishing Fleetwood fires into contention with a 67 Lowry, along with Westwood, Fleetwood and Rose are Europe's best hopes of stopping a possible American clean-sweep of this year's majors. Fleetwood, last year's US Open runner-up, has gradually improved his final placing at his home major over the past few years. He missed the cut in his first three attempts before a tied 27th in 2017 and tied 12th in 2018. On Friday, the 28-year-old continued his impressive start to this year's campaign with six birdies en route to a 67. ""I felt like I was a lot more stress-free,"" said Fleetwood, whose last win was in Abu Dhabi in January 2018. ""I made two or three good par-saves, but I enjoy the challenge."" This video can not be played The Open 2019: Lee Westwood & Jordan Spieth among best shots from day 2 Westwood, 46, has also yet to win major although he has finished among the top-three places on six occasions, including a second-placed finish at The Open in 2010. This year the Worksop player has been aided in his mission by girlfriend Helen Storey, who been working as his caddie at a major tournament for the first time. ""She's delighted to be caddying at a major because she doesn't have to rake the bunkers and get sand on her trainers,"" said Westwood, who sunk four birdies in an unblemished round of 67. ""Obviously I get on well with Helen. She doesn't know too much about golf but she knows a lot about the way my mind works, so she keeps me in a good frame of mind, and keeps me focused on the right things at the right times."" Last year, Rose finished tied second but only after just making the cut. The 2013 US Open has given himself a better platform from which to challenge for his second major. ""That weekend would be worth everything if you could put it all together when it counts,"" said Rose, who also recorded a 67. ""Obviously last year it almost counted. It was great. But it was important for me to have that weekend because it made me believe I could win this tournament. ""I'm comfortable with how much I expect of myself and that makes it easier tomorrow and the next day."" 2018 European Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn on BBC Two: ""We have to give Rory McIlroy credit for what he did in equalling the best round of the day. He made a great effort but all the damage was done on Thursday. The crowd expect so much of him and at least he delivered in his second round. ""We all want to see the greatest players here at the weekend but there's a new breed of player coming through and you have to play your best at majors. It's disappointing McIlroy and Woods are not here but there's a great leaderboard and so many great players. Just because you have played well in the past doesn't give you the right to be here. ""Shane Lowry's first 10 holes were amazing but the excitement got a little bit to him in the end and he needs to try to relax and lay out a plan. He then has to stick to it because the last few holes here are very difficult. ""Lee Westwood is running out of chances to win the Open and would be a very popular winner. He's one of the best players in the world not to have won a major. He has all the qualities - he's so good tee to green but sometimes his putting lets him down. He's putting well this week and there's no reason why he can't be standing there with the trophy on Sunday if he can keep that form going.""

"This video can not be played Temperatures rising for USA Extremely hot weather has started to hit most of the United States, with temperatures set to peak over the weekend, meteorologists say. The heatwave could affect about 200 million people in major cities like New York, Washington and Boston in the East Coast, and the Midwest region too. In some places, temperatures could be close to or exceed 100F (38C). Parts of Canada are also being hit. Experts link more frequent heatwaves in recent years to climate change. The world experienced its hottest June on record this year,with an average temperature worldwide of 61.6F (16.4C), according to new data. Alaska heatwave: Anchorage hits record temperature Climate change in seven charts Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers Earlier this month, the US state of Alaska, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, registered record high temperatures. The heatwave is hitting an area stretching from the Central Plains of Colorado and Kansas, to the Great Lakes in the north-east. A little girl cools off in water fountains in Washington DC Temperatures are also rising in most areas of the East Coast. The National Weather Service (NWS) published a map of the areas that are affected. ""The hazy, hot and humid conditions will persist through the weekend. Be smart and stay cool!"" it warned.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared ""a local emergency due to the extreme heat"" in the city. ""This is a heatwave coming up these next days. It's serious stuff,"" the mayor said in a video posted on Twitter. ""Friday is going to be bad. Saturday is going to be really, really bad on through Sunday."" Allow Twitter content?

He urged New Yorkers to take the threat seriously, to stay hydrated, and to not go out in the hot weather. Mr de Blasio added that 500 ""cooling centres"" were being opened across New York. Similar measures were being taken in Detroit and other cities. In Canada, heat warnings have been issued for parts of the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia. Daytime temperatures in Toronto could feel like 40C (104F) on Friday and Saturday, when humidity is factored in. Severe thunderstorms are also expected. Canadian meteorologists say that in Montreal the temperature could feel like 45C with humidity over the next two days. US meteorologists say the heatwave is expected to continue through the weekend, and some cities may see their highest temperatures in years. In some cities it might feel as hot as in California's Death Valley - a desert region known for its extreme heat. But they say a dramatic change is on the way early next week, when it is expected to suddenly cool off. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

"The chairman of the High Speed 2 rail project has reportedly warned that its cost could rise by Â£30bn. HS2 chairman Allan Cook has written to the Department for Transport to say the high-speed line cannot be delivered within its Â£56bn budget,according to the Financial Times,external. The DfT said a review of HS2's costs is continuing. The line will connect London, the Midlands and northern England using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. ""The chairman of HS2 Ltd is conducting detailed work into of the costs and schedule of the project to ensure it delivers benefits to passengers, the economy and represents value for money for the taxpayer,"" the DfT said in a statement. ""This work is ongoing. We expect Allan Cook to provide his final assessment in due course."" What do we know about HS2? Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? The first segment of the project between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. An HS2 spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on leaks or speculation. ""We have previously noted that our chair, as you would expect, continues to scrutinise the programme, and regularly reports back to the Department [for Transport]. ""We are determined to deliver a railway that rebalances the economy, creates jobs, boosts economic growth and is value for money for taxpayers."" Mr Cook was appointed to head HS2 in December 2018 after his predecessor, Sir Terry Morgan, resigned as chairman because of delays at the Crossrail project in London which he was also leading. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent There has been no denial that this letter was sent by the chairman of HS2 to the top civil servant at the Department for Transport. And none of my contacts have rubbished the ""potential Â£30bn overspend"" idea outright. Sources at HS2 and at the DfT insist Allan Cook's review is ongoing and that he has not settled on a final figure. That may be true, but there has been a subtle shift of tone in recent months from both HS2 and the government; a creeping acceptance that the project, in its current form, is increasingly unlikely to come in within its Â£56bn budget. And there has already been plenty of evidence suggesting that the project's original estimates of how much it would cost to purchase land and property along the route were significantly below the true values. This leak, which feels at the very least like a case of 'no smoke without fire', comes at a very sensitive time. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who has repeatedly insisted that the project HAS to be delivered within budget, is possibly leaving his post in a matter of days. Boris Johnson - considered the front-runner to be the UK's next prime minister - is by no means a die-hard fan of the scheme. And Mr Johnson has already nominated a former HS2 executive, Douglas Oakervee, to carry out a separate review of the project if he gets the keys to No 10 next week. Â£56bn was already a hefty sum. As a former senior official at the Treasury puts it: ""In terms of value for money it [HS2] scores lower than lots of other projects.""

"This video can not be played Rory McIlroy turns on the style in remarkable cut chase at the Open The 148th Open Championship - second-round leaderboard -8JB Holmes (US), S Lowry (Ire);-7L Westwood (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng);-6C Smith (Aus), J Harding (SA), J Rose (Eng);-5B Koepka (US), J Spieth (US), A Puttnam (US), D Frittelli (SA) Selected others:-4J Rahm (Spa);-3T Hatton (Eng), D Johnson (US), R Fowler (US);-2E Els J Day (SA);-1D Willett (Eng);EF Molinari (Ita);+2R McIlroy (NI)+6T Woods (US);+7I Poulter (Eng);+8P Mickelson (US) Rory McIlroy agonisingly missed the cut at his home Open as Ireland's Shane Lowry produced a four-under-par 67 to take a share of the lead. McIlroy's 79 on Thursday left him eight shots shy of the cut at one over, and he almost achieved his feat but failed to pick up a birdie at the last. Lowry, 32, is on eight under alongside USA's JB Holmes, with England's Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood a shot back. Another Englishman, Justin Rose, is on six under after a 67 at Royal Portrush. World number one Brooks Koepka and 2017 Open champion Jordan Spieth are a shot further back on five under, but former winners Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Darren Clarke all missed the cut. It is the first time both Woods and Mickelson have gone out of the same major after the first two rounds. I felt the crowd's love - emotional McIlroy 'I'm not consistent anymore' - Woods Open leaderboard after second round The crowd following McIlroy around the County Antrim course began to grow in size as he sank birdie after birdie on the inward nine. By the 18th the cheer that greeted the 2014 champion was as if he was going for his second title rather than a mission to make the cut. However, his hopes faded with his approach to the green as the wind took the ball down the bank. The following chip landed wide and ended the 30-year-old's hopes of winning a major on home soil. ""Part of me is very disappointed not to be here for the weekend. I'm emotional but happy with how I played,"" said McIlroy. ""The support I got out there was incredible and you could see on the back nine, I went with it today and that's what I was planning to do all week. ""Yesterday gave me a mountain to climb but I dug in and showed good resilience. ""It's going to hurt for a bit. I've been looking forward to this week for a long time. ""I didn't play my part but everyone in Northern Ireland came out to watch me and played theirs."" Relive live coverage of the Open's second day Full BBC TV and radio coverage times This video can not be played 'Birdie, birdie, birdie!' - Lowryâs lightning start It has been quite an eventful 12 months for Lowry who has risen to from world number 90 to 33 following victory in Abu Dhabi in January and an eighth place at the US PGA. His best performance at a major to date was tied second at the 2016 US Open. However, he is now targeting his first major. ""I'm obviously going to be thinking about it tonight,"" he said when asked about the prospect of winning the Claret Jug. ""There's no point in shying away from it. I'm in a great position but, my goodness, have we got a long way to go. ""As a golfer you have such a long career. I've been 10 years now and it's just a rollercoaster. I think the reason I'm so good mentally now is I know - I think - how to take the downs."" Clarke, who got the 148th Open under way, will also miss the weekend after he finished on three over. However, Graeme McDowell, born a short distance from the course, managed to sneak through on one over as did last year's champion Francesco Molinari, who carded a 69. The Cut podcast: It's all about the cut This video can not be played Spieth surges up leaderboard with three birdies and an eagle Unlike McIlroy, three-time winner and current Masters champion Woods never looked like making the cut, and finished on six over. It is only the third time in 21 attempts the 15-time major winner has not made the weekend at The Open, and only the 10th time in majors he has missed the cut. Seven of those have come in the past 13 tournaments. Fellow American and 2013 champion Mickelson ended his campaign with a 74 for eight over. Former champions Paul Lawrie and Padraig Harrington also missed the cut, as did European Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter. Another former winner, David Duval, ended his sorry campaign on 27 over after he followed Thursday's 91 with a 78. The biggest challenge to a European win might come from world number one Koepka and Spieth, who are both on five under. American Koepka, seeking his fifth major in two years, followed Thursday's 68 with a 69, and compatriot Spieth produced an eagle on the par-five seventh on his way to a 67. Australia's Cameron Smith and Justin Harding are among those in contention, on six under. This video can not be played Fast-finishing Fleetwood fires into contention with a 67 Lowry, along with Westwood, Fleetwood and Rose are Europe's best hopes of stopping a possible American clean-sweep of this year's majors. Fleetwood, last year's US Open runner-up, has gradually improved his final placing at his home major over the past few years. He missed the cut in his first three attempts before a tied 27th in 2017 and tied 12th in 2018. On Friday, the 28-year-old continued his impressive start to this year's campaign with six birdies en route to a 67. ""I felt like I was a lot more stress-free,"" said Fleetwood, whose last win was in Abu Dhabi in January 2018. ""I made two or three good par-saves, but I enjoy the challenge."" This video can not be played The Open 2019: Lee Westwood & Jordan Spieth among best shots from day 2 Westwood, 46, has also yet to win major although he has finished among the top-three places on six occasions, including a second-placed finish at The Open in 2010. This year the Worksop player has been aided in his mission by girlfriend Helen Storey, who been working as his caddie at a major tournament for the first time. ""She's delighted to be caddying at a major because she doesn't have to rake the bunkers and get sand on her trainers,"" said Westwood, who sunk four birdies in an unblemished round of 67. ""Obviously I get on well with Helen. She doesn't know too much about golf but she knows a lot about the way my mind works, so she keeps me in a good frame of mind, and keeps me focused on the right things at the right times."" Last year, Rose finished tied second but only after just making the cut. The 2013 US Open has given himself a better platform from which to challenge for his second major. ""That weekend would be worth everything if you could put it all together when it counts,"" said Rose, who also recorded a 67. ""Obviously last year it almost counted. It was great. But it was important for me to have that weekend because it made me believe I could win this tournament. ""I'm comfortable with how much I expect of myself and that makes it easier tomorrow and the next day."" 2018 European Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn on BBC Two: ""We have to give Rory McIlroy credit for what he did in equalling the best round of the day. He made a great effort but all the damage was done on Thursday. The crowd expect so much of him and at least he delivered in his second round. ""We all want to see the greatest players here at the weekend but there's a new breed of player coming through and you have to play your best at majors. It's disappointing McIlroy and Woods are not here but there's a great leaderboard and so many great players. Just because you have played well in the past doesn't give you the right to be here. ""Shane Lowry's first 10 holes were amazing but the excitement got a little bit to him in the end and he needs to try to relax and lay out a plan. He then has to stick to it because the last few holes here are very difficult. ""Lee Westwood is running out of chances to win the Open and would be a very popular winner. He's one of the best players in the world not to have won a major. He has all the qualities - he's so good tee to green but sometimes his putting lets him down. He's putting well this week and there's no reason why he can't be standing there with the trophy on Sunday if he can keep that form going.""

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond has indicated he may vote to bring down the next PM to stop a no-deal Brexit. Asked whether he would back a motion of no-confidence in the government, he said he could ""not exclude anything"". Mr Hammond also said he would do ""everything in my power"" to stop a future prime minister suspending Parliament to get a no-deal Brexit. He was one of four cabinet ministers who abstained from a vote blocking the possibility of this happening. The Commons vote was brought forward on Thursdayby MPs who fear the next Conservative leader and prime minister will make the move - known as ""prorogation"" - to push through a no-deal Brexit and cut them out of the process. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has discounted the possibility if he becomes prime minister, but his rival in the Conservative Party leadership race, Boris Johnson, has refused to give the same assurance. No-deal Brexit 'could cause Â£30bn economic hit' MPs ask EU to protect UK citizens in no-deal Brexit Scheme to block no-deal Brexit 'could involve Queen' The leadership candidates trying to stop Brexit In an interview withLe Monde,externalandSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, Mr Hammond said he would ""take steps to avoid an exit without agreement apart from an explicit parliamentary approval"". Speaking on Tuesday at the G7 conference in Paris, he told the French and German newspapers: ""There should be a new and sincere attempt to reach a consensus. ""If we do not find a solution with the members, we may have to ask the British to give their opinion again, in one form or another."" Asked if he would rule out supporting a motion of no confidence - which, if successful, would bring down the government - he said: ""I do not exclude anything for the moment."" It is a chance for MPs to hold a vote on whether they want the government to continue - and it has the power to trigger a general election. Any MP can propose a motion of no confidence, but that doesn't mean it would be debated. However, if the leader of the opposition introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time for a debate to take place. Read more about the process here. Mr Hammond also said another extension to Brexit was ""absolutely necessary"" in practice, as there was not enough time to renegotiate with the EU ahead of 31 October deadline. He added: ""If the next government is sincere in its desire to reach an agreement with Europe, it must try to get more time. If it does not, the British parliament will insist on getting a new postponement. ""I will remain a member of the House of Commons. I will do everything in my power from my position to make sure that parliament blocks a Brexit without agreement."" By Jessica Parker, political correspondent The so-called ""awkward squad"" - a group of Conservative Eurosceptic MPs - has for a long time made life tricky for David Cameron and Theresa May. With the pro-Brexit Boris Johnson apparently on the cusp of becoming PM, the expectation is that a chunk of the group could get government jobs. And the rest will surely hold fire on their new boss, at least for a while. Taking their placeâ¦ the ""Gaukeward squad"", named after current Justice Secretary David Gauke. The current projection is that it will be made up of Mr Gauke, Chancellor Philip Hammond and a good handful of other Tory MPs who avidly oppose a no-deal Brexit. Just how Gaukeward will they be? Mr Hammond's comments on potentially supporting a no-confidence vote suggest he - in principle at least - is willing to go pretty far to make his point. But is this just tough talk in order to let off some loud warning shots? We won't know until the crunch moment - if and a when Parliament finds itself confronted with the very real and immediate prospect of a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Mr Hammond said Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership race,  was ""a more complex personality than it sometimes seems"", and was ""a mainstream Conservative on all topics except Brexit"". But he pleaded for the EU to have patience with some of Mr Johnson's Brexit-backing supporters in the Conservative Party who were being ""deliberately noisy, rude and inconsiderate... to make the Europeans so tired that they ask us to leave"". He added: ""Please, do not listen to the the few noise-makers."" Pro-Remain Tory Dominic Grieve told the BBC that he thought a ""substantial number"" of his party would be willing to support a vote of no confidence in the government to stop a no-deal Brexit. He said: ""I'm going to be working with colleagues who share my view that no deal would be very bad for the country to try to make sure that the government cannot push us into no deal without Parliament having consented to it."" Health minister Stephen Hammond - who abstained in Thursday's vote - said he would not rule out supporting a no-confidence vote in his own government if its policy became pursuing a no-deal Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A lot of people were taught that you must put the interest of the country before yourself."" But leading Brexiteer and Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the same programme those trying to prevent it were ""not saying what they believe"", and their intention was to ""snub the British voters"" and stop Brexit altogether. He did, however, say prorogation was a possibility ""for a day or two"" to stop parliamentary procedures being ""upended"" by backbenchers trying to block the UK leaving the EU. If MPs fail to support a Brexit deal agreed between UK and EU by 31 October, the legal default is to leave with no deal on that date. Both contenders to be the next prime minister said they want to keep to the date and renegotiate with the EU, leaving with a deal. But Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have also said they would keep no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations, despite Parliament voting to rule the option out. The EU has consistently said the withdrawal agreement is closed and cannot be changed. The incoming president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said she hopes the UK remains in the EU, but it was up to British authorities to ""sort its side of things on Brexit"". Asked about Mrs von der Leyen's position, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she understood that ""if the UK wishes for more time [e.g. another delay to Brexit], then they would have more time"", but it was ""up to the UK"". She praised her ""cooperative relationship"" with Theresa May, adding: ""She has not had an easy time dealing with this difficult question. I always found her to be a reliable and collegial partner, and I thank her for that."" But she added: ""We now have the position that there will be a new PM, and then we have to watch what that person decides.""

"This video can not be played Temperatures rising for USA Extremely hot weather has started to hit most of the United States, with temperatures set to peak over the weekend, meteorologists say. The heatwave could affect about 200 million people in major cities like New York, Washington and Boston in the East Coast, and the Midwest region too. In some places, temperatures could be close to or exceed 100F (38C). Parts of Canada are also being hit. Experts link more frequent heatwaves in recent years to climate change. The world experienced its hottest June on record this year,with an average temperature worldwide of 61.6F (16.4C), according to new data. Alaska heatwave: Anchorage hits record temperature Climate change in seven charts Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers Earlier this month, the US state of Alaska, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, registered record high temperatures. The heatwave is hitting an area stretching from the Central Plains of Colorado and Kansas, to the Great Lakes in the north-east. A little girl cools off in water fountains in Washington DC Temperatures are also rising in most areas of the East Coast. The National Weather Service (NWS) published a map of the areas that are affected. ""The hazy, hot and humid conditions will persist through the weekend. Be smart and stay cool!"" it warned.

He urged New Yorkers to take the threat seriously, to stay hydrated, and to not go out in the hot weather. Mr de Blasio added that 500 ""cooling centres"" were being opened across New York. Similar measures were being taken in Detroit and other cities. In Canada, heat warnings have been issued for parts of the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia. Daytime temperatures in Toronto could feel like 40C (104F) on Friday and Saturday, when humidity is factored in. Severe thunderstorms are also expected. Canadian meteorologists say that in Montreal the temperature could feel like 45C with humidity over the next two days. US meteorologists say the heatwave is expected to continue through the weekend, and some cities may see their highest temperatures in years. In some cities it might feel as hot as in California's Death Valley - a desert region known for its extreme heat. But they say a dramatic change is on the way early next week, when it is expected to suddenly cool off. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

"More than a year after its slipway launch, work continues on Glen Sannox The Scottish government is drawing up plans to nationalise Ferguson shipyard on the Clyde. That option is the increasingly likely outcome of a dispute over the building of two west coast ferries for CalMac. The BBC has learned of ""fraught"" negotiations over a bill that is now understood to be nearly double the original Â£97m contract price. Tycoon Jim McColl, who rescued the yard from collapse five years ago, stands to lose tens of millions of pounds. Analysis by Douglas Fraser Ferguson Marine could lose Â£40m on ferries Frustration of Ferguson owner McColl Ferguson shipyard loaned Â£30m to diversify That is far removed from the heroic status he was given by SNP ministers when he stepped in to save the totemic shipyard in Port Glasgow - the only commercial yard left on the lower Clyde. That was only days before the referendum on Scottish independence, and was partly brokered by Alex Salmond as first minister. Derek Mackay, the finance and economy secretary, is now handling the talks with Clyde Blowers, Mr McColl's holding company. Who pays the ferryman? Stage set for legal battle That takes the dispute out the hands of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) - the government-owned firm that placed the orders and owns CalMac's fleet. The official comment from the Scottish government was: ""The Scottish government, Ferguson's and CMAL are focussed on the completion of the current ferry contracts and securing a vibrant future for the yard. We continue to work together to achieve that."" Privately, the government is determined to ensure the yard remains open. Its current workforce is about 350. When Ferguson shipyard went bust in the summer of 2014, a white knight stepped forward in the shape of self-made billionaire Jim McColl. Massive investment swiftly followed; old buildings were demolished to make way for state-of-the-art fabrication facilities and the skilled workforce rose five-fold in one of Scotland's most deprived areas. The following year the yard received a major boost when it won a Â£97m contract to build two dual-fuel ferries for CalMac. But neither ferry has yet to be delivered, Ferguson is losing millions on the deal - and one of the most prominent business figures to support Scottish independence ahead of the 2014 referendum is now locked in a bitter dispute with the Scottish government. Read more But ministers are not giving ground on the fixed price contract agreed between Ferguson Marine and CMAL. It is claimed that doing so would bring legal action by other bidders that failed to win the contract. The dispute on the contract was reviewed by a senior lawyer, whose report is being kept confidential. It is understood to be more favourable to CMAL than to Ferguson's position, but the review's scope and caveats leave the contractual dispute open to protracted legal action. The Scottish government's position is that Ferguson and Clyde Blowers should pay the additional costs, of about Â£90m. It is claimed that ministers then want the yard to continue as a successful business. If not, then a sale of the assets could be agreed, with the price set independently. The other option is insolvency. From there, issuers of Â£25m in bonds would have a first claim on the company's assets, but the Scottish government also has security over assets. That is because the Scottish government has loaned Ferguson Â£45m over the past five years, in a series of decisions which have provoked controversy at Holyrood. Sources at Ferguson believe the Scottish government wants to nationalise the yard, in a political project linked to public ownership of rail and other transport operators. The yard would then become solely focused on a programme of replacement ships for CalMac, which are well behind schedule. The shipyard, beside Newark Castle, has had major investment under Jim McColl's ownership The winner of the franchise for the passenger service linking Orkney and Shetland to the Scottish mainland is due to be announced in the next few weeks, pitting state-owned Cal-Mac against Serco, the incumbent operator. However, further nationalisation would also put the SNP government under pressure over the cost of sustaining loss-making enterprises, already including Prestwick Airport and BiFab, which has mothballed fabrication yards in Fife and another in Lewis. A spokesman for Ferguson Marine Engineering said: ""We continue to engage with both the Scottish government and CMAL, and remain fully committed to securing the long-term future of the yard.""

"The raids were carried out in 2017 Two people have been found guilty of animal welfare offences after a raid at what is believed to have been Scotland's largest puppy farm. Scottish SPCA officers and police had swooped on the farm near Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, in November 2017. A total of more than 100 dogs, puppies, rabbits and ferrets, were seized. Frank James, 54, and Michelle Wood, 30, were on trial charged with causing unnecessary suffering by failing to provide adequate care and treatment. Animals seized in 'puppy farm' raid Two reported over 'puppy farm' raid James, from Banff, and Wood, from Macduff, were found guilty at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Frank James will be sentenced next month Police Scotland helped Scottish SPCA officers in the raid Sentence was deferred until next month for reports. An undercover investigator for the Scottish SPCA said: ""We believe this was the largest scale puppy farming operation in Scotland. ""The conditions these dogs were being kept in were absolutely disgraceful. ""It fell far below the minimum standard in terms of animal welfare and, given the environment and sheer volume of puppies, it was immediately evident these were not being kept as pets and the premises was effectively a battery farm for pups. ""Our investigation revealed dogs on site were being intensively bred with little to no regard for their welfare."" Almost 90 dogs were seized Almost 90 dogs and puppies were among the animals seized in the operation. All of the surviving animals were successfully rehomed. The Scottish SPCA had carried out the operation with Police Scotland using warrants obtained under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2006 (Scotland).

"Public sector net borrowing rose sharply in June because of higher debt interest payments and rising spending on services, figures show. It totalled Â£7.2bn,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, up from Â£3.3bn in June 2018. It was the highest June borrowing figure since 2015, the ONS said. Analysts said the figures would add to the uncertainty surrounding the UK economy in the run-up to Brexit and the imminent change of prime minister. ""The outlook for fiscal policy was already uncertain because of the extension of Brexit until 31 October, in addition to the imminent change of Conservative leader and prime minister,"" said the EY Item Club. ""Much will depend on whether the economy can shrug off its current weakness, as well as on Brexit developments. It will also be influenced by any changes to fiscal policy by the new prime minister and chancellor ."" Last month, the government took in Â£800m more in tax and National Insurance contributions than a year previously, but debt repayments rose by Â£2.1bn. The ONS said there was ""a notable increase"" in expenditure on goods and services of Â£1.2bn, while the UK's contribution to the EU increased by Â£400m compared with June 2018. In the three months to June, borrowing was 33% higher than the same period in 2018 at Â£17.9bn. Public sector net debt rose to Â£1.81 trillion, or 83.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). The latest figures, which show public spending running ahead of forecasts, come as concerns grow over the state of the UK economy in the run-up to Brexit. The most recent GDP figures showedthe economy grew by 0.3% in Mayafter shrinking 0.4% in April. But economists say that June's growth figures will have to be strong to avoid contraction in the second quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said borrowing would probably just stay within the rules set out by the current Chancellor, Philip Hammond. ""His successor, however, looks highly likely to tear up the existing rules, setting the stage for a giveaway Budget in the autumn and for fiscal policy to materially boost GDP growth next year,"" he added. ""The Conservatives are desperate to improve their poll rating and public support for austerity has crumbled, so a fiscal boost is coming."" On Thursday, the Office for Budget Responsibility saidborrowing could rise by Â£30bn a year in 2020-21if the UK leaves the EU without a transition deal on 31 October. The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment of the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy could contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021.

"This video can not be played WATCH: ""It starts to look like censorship"" YouTube has defended its video recommendation algorithms, amid suggestions that the technology serves up increasingly extreme videos. On Thursday, a BBC report explored howYouTube had helped the Flat Earth conspiracy theory spread. But the company's new managing director for the UK, Ben McOwen Wilson, said YouTube ""does the opposite of taking you down the rabbit hole"". He told the BBC that YouTube worked to dispel misinformation and conspiracies. But warned that some types of government regulation could start to look like censorship. YouTube, as well as other internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter, have some big decisions to make. All must decide where they draw the line between freedom of expression, hateful content and misinformation. And the government is watching. It has published a White Paperlaying out its plans to regulate online platforms. In his first interview since starting his new role, Mr McOwen Wilson spoke about the company's algorithms, its approach to hate speech and what it expects from the UK government's ""online harms"" legislation. YouTube uses algorithms to recommend more videos for you to watch. These video suggestions appear in the app, down the side of the website and also show up when you get to the end of a video. But YouTube has never explained exactly how its algorithms work. Critics say the platform offers up increasingly sensationalist and conspiratorial videos. Mr McOwen Wilson disagrees. ""It's what's great about YouTube. It is what brings you from one small area and actually expands your horizon and does the opposite of taking you down the rabbit hole,"" he says. This video can not be played WATCH: Has YouTube helped conspiracy theorists thrive? ""Very often it doesn't take you to content that's exactly like the one you've watched before."" Even so, Mr McOwen Wilson says YouTube has started adding a sort of ""warning"" label to certain conspiracy topics. ""If it's misinformation, we provide correct information around that. We work with Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia to provide knowledge panels that come up on the side of the screen. So if you're watching a flat Earth video... we will present to you a link to the facts about that."" Facebook used to do something similar with fake news. It would label false stories as ""disputed"" with a red warning label, and offered up other sources of information. But the social network later said this had often entrenched people's pre-existing views and made the problem worse. ""We haven't found that,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. He says the platform reduces the spread of content designed to mislead people, and raises up ""authoritative voices"". He names BBC News, the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Sun as examples of authoritative sources. Some conspiracy theories - such as Holocaust denial -have been banned on the platform completely.,external In June, a row erupted between two YouTube video-makers. Vox reporter Carlos Maza posted a video showing all the times that comedian Steven Crowder had mocked him for being gay, or used insulting language attacking his sexual orientation and ethnicity. Mr Crowder said the videos were ""friendly ribbing"". After a series of muddled statements on Twitter, YouTube eventually confirmed that Mr Crowder had not broken its hate speech rules. ""Was the language used hate speech? Was there incitement against Carlos Maza from the other creator? In that instance, we found that there was not,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. ""I think that remains the right policy decision to have made."" That decision disappointed Mr Maza's supporters - and many of YouTube's own staff. More than 100 signed a petition asking for Google to be kicked out of the San Francisco Pride parade. Carlos Maza presents videos for Vox The language may not have been ""hate speech"", but critics argue that mocking somebody for being gay crosses a line into bullying. ""It doesn't currently breach our harassment policies,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. But he adds: ""We are inarguably pro-LGBT. I wouldn't want anyone to judge us only on that. I don't think it invalidates everything else that we've done."" He points out that YouTube has provided a platform for people to express their sexuality in a largely ""supportive environment"". ""I don't think any of that should be invalidated because of where we have drawn this line on the Maza-Crowder issue."" YouTube tells its video-makers that one key to success on the platform is ""watch time"": making sure viewers stick around for longer. Facebook, on the other hand, has been talking more about ""time well spent"" on the platform. It says it is more important that people have a good time on Facebook. How do the two approaches compare? ""One of the biggest and most positive steps that was taken on the platform, that drove down a huge amount of trashy content, was the shift from 'views' to watch time"", says Mr McOwen Wilson. YouTube star Etika's fans tattooed in his memory Welsh stone carver is unintentional YouTube star YouTube users can't stop streaming Latin Pop ""The best way for an audience to tell us whether they like what they're being served isn't whether they click on it in the first place, but whether they spent any of their time with it."" But does the system encourage video-makers to make longer videos, and draw out simple how-to clips into a 20-minute extravaganza? Mr McOwen Wilson says the videos which are most viewed are those that people watch in their entirety. And he adds: ""Clearly a longer one that is viewed the whole way through by the majority of its audience is more likely to come up."" The UK government is currently weighing up how online platforms such as YouTube could be regulated. In April, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said the ""era of self-regulation for online companies is over"". Is YouTube worried? ""The moment you put somebody in charge... there is somebody who is filtering what content goes out,"" warns Mr McOwen Wilson. ""If they're government-appointed, that begins to look very much like censorship, and we don't launch in markets where that is a risk. ""I don't think it would be the right answer to have anybody at YouTube - or indeed anywhere else - editorialising all of the content that comes up on to our platform."" Culture secretary Jeremy Wright says the era of self-regulation is over And either way, it would be impossible. About 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. The summer holidays have started - or are about to start - across the UK for thousands of children. ""By the time most of them go back to school, there will be more content uploaded to YouTube than has ever been created in the history of television or film globally,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. He suggests a regulator could determine areas where online platforms should have policies, but the platforms themselves should create the policies. ""The world will be watching where the UK lands on this,"" he says. ""There are regimes out there who will mirror - in their own ways - the position that they view the UK has taken. ""There is a risk - and actually a huge opportunity - for the UK to show leadership on what balanced regulation could look like in an open environment.""

"Clockwise from top left: Gavin & Stacey, Love Island, Victoria and Happy Valley will be on BritBox Shows like Love Island, Gavin & Stacey, Gentleman Jack and Broadchurch will be on ITV and the BBC's streaming service BritBox when it launches this year. The broadcasters are joining forces to set up the subscription service in the UK as a rival to the likes of Netflix. It will cost Â£5.99 per month in HD, launching between October and the end of December. New programmes will also be made specially for BritBox, with the first arriving next year. Other existing series to be made available will include Victoria, Happy Valley, Les Miserables, The Office and Benidorm. The monthly fee will cover multiple screens and devices, ""which is less than other streaming services"", a statement said. Many ITV and BBC programmes will move on to BritBox after they have been broadcast on TV and fallen off the broadcasters' own catch-up services - BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.The BBC is soon expected to get permissionfrom regulator Ofcom to keep shows on iPlayer for a year as standard. This video can not be played What is BritBox? As well as recent shows, it will also be the home of thousands of hours of classic British comedies, dramas and documentaries. Not all BBC and ITV programmes will automatically go on BritBox, though. Many are made by independent production companies, who own the rights and might instead sell them to a service like Netflix after their TV broadcasts, as has previously happened with hits like Peaky Blinders. Some BBC and ITV shows that are already on Netflix,such as Happy Valley, will move to Britbox - but, again, it will depend on who owns the rights. The BBC and Netflix will also carry on co-producing programmes together as a way of sharing costs, especially for big-budget dramas. But BBC director general Tony Hall said BritBox was ""the prime place in which we want our material to end up"". BritBox - Â£5.99 for HD viewing and multi-screen viewing Netflix - Â£5.99 for basic package rising to Â£8.99 for a standard plan, including HD on two-screens. Ultra HD and four screen simultaneous viewing is Â£11.99. Amazon Prime - Â£5.99 on up to three screens simultaneously. Now TV - Â£7.99 for entertainment pass, with optional extras - Cinema Pass (Â£11.99), Sports (Â£33.99), Kids (Â£3.99) YouTube Premium - Â£11.99 Asked why viewers should pay an extra charge to watch shows originally funded by the licence fee, Lord Hall compared BritBox with releasing a programme on DVD. ""That was the BBC saying, there's a secondary market - you pay for content after we've shown it,"" he said. ""This is just a modern-day version of that, and an even better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you'd seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn't get hold of the DVD."" Any money the corporation makes will be put back in to programme-making, he said. ""I think this is wins all round for the licence fee payers."" The new shows to be made specifically for the new platform will be exclusive to BritBox, and the annual budget for original programming will be in the tens of millions of pounds. In comparison, Netflixreportedly spent $12bn (Â£9.5bn) on programmes last year,external. Broadchurch will be one of the shows on offer Normally rivals, the two broadcasters want to get a foothold in a fiercely competitive commercial streaming world against the likes of Netflix, Amazon and NowTV, while Disney+ and AppleTV+ are launching soon. The BBC and ITV tried to launch something similar a decade ago, butwere blocked by regulators,external. Now they are trying to catch up with their heavyweight competitors. Netflix has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide - but sawits share price plummet this week, after adding fewer viewers than expected in the last three months, with price rises blamed. The BBC and ITV launched BritBox in North America in 2017, showing programmes like Midsomer Murders, Poirot and Only Fools and Horses. It now has 650,000 subscribers, which ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said was ""exceeding its targets"". The BBC, which made a recent adaptation of Les Miserables, will own 10% of BritBox at launch, with ITV controlling 90% The bottom line is that BritBox is another way to attract eyeballs and to make money from the broadcasters' back catalogues. Dame Carolyn said the agreement to launch BritBox in the UK was ""a milestone moment"". She said: ""Subscription video on demand is increasingly popular with consumers who love being able to watch what they want, when they want to watch it. They are also happy to pay for this ease of access to quality content and so BritBox is tapping into this, and a new revenue stream for UK public service broadcasters."" ITV will own 90% of the new BritBox service and the BBC's initial 10% stake could rise to 25% in the future. Lord Hall insisted that this was not the first step toward changing the BBC from a licence fee-funded organisation to a subscription model. ""The fundamental funding for the future must be through the licence fee,"" he said. Friday's press release said ""viewers will want to subscribe to BritBox because it is uniquely British"", and that there is ""growing consumer demand in the UK for streaming services"". Five million homes have more than one subscription TV service - a growth of 34% per year. Former BBC executive Ashley Highfield said he thought the monthly price was ""about right"", and that BritBox would end up with subscriber numbers in the ""low millions"". He told BBC News: ""I don't think they think it's something that's going to take over from Netflix. It's probably going to rub alongside."" TV critic Emma Bullimore said she thought asking viewers to pay for mainly old content would be ""quite tough"". She told the BBC: ""I think in the long term it's going to be a success. In the short term I think it's going to be a bit of a struggle."" She added: ""It is bad news for TV fans in that we're going to have to pay for loads of individual subscriptions. Now, most people have their TV, maybe they have Sky and Netflix - whereas if you have to pay for Netflix, Amazon, Disney, BritBoxâ¦ it's going to get quite expensive."" Broadcasting analyst Tom Harrington from Enders Analysis said there is ""certainly a market for great British content"", but that BritBox might be a tough sell. ""You're going to get a lot of content that you've seen before, content that you think you might have paid for before, and content that's been free for possibly a year on iPlayer,"" he said. ""Why people sign up for services is usually for new, original content, and there will be a paucity of that on this service."" Its budget for original programming and technology will not rival those of the US streaming giants, he added. ""It's not going to be a Netflix killer. It won't take over Amazon in any way. What it will be is an almost niche service alongside those two, at best."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Discarded cigarette butts can hamper plant growth, new research suggests. The study, led by Anglia Ruskin University, found the presence of butts in soil reduced the germination success and shoot length of clover by 27% and 28% respectively. For grass, germination success reduced by 10% and shoot length by 13%. An estimated 4.5 trillion butts are littered globally each year making them the planet's most pervasive form of plastic pollution, the study said. Most cigarette butts contain a filter made of cellulose acetate fibre, a type of a bioplastic. But researchers found filters from un-smoked cigarettes had almost the same effect on plant growth as used filters, indicating that the damage to plants is caused by the filter itself, even without the additional toxins released from the burning of the tobacco. Man spots 'own amputation' on cigarette packets Bird feeding chick cigarette end captured in picture Nature's emergency in five graphics As part of the research -published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,external- academics sampled locations around the city of Cambridge and found areas with as many as 128 discarded cigarette butts per sq metre. Control experiments were carried out and contained pieces of wood of identical shape and size as the cigarette butts. Lead author Dr Dannielle Green said while dropping butts seemed to be ""socially acceptable"", they had the ability to ""cause serious damage to the environment"". Dr Green - a senior biology lecturer at ARU - said: ""Despite being a common sight littering streets and parks worldwide, our study is the first to show the impact of cigarette butts on plants. ""We found they had a detrimental effect on the germination success and shoot length of both grass and clover, and reduced the root weight of clover by over half. ""Ryegrass and white clover, the two species we tested, are important forage crops for livestock as well as being commonly found in urban green spaces. ""These plants support a wealth of biodiversity, even in city parks, and white clover is ecologically important for pollinators and nitrogen fixation."" She said that the filters can take years, if not decades, to break down. This video can not be played 'Why I'm collecting a million cigarette butts' Co-author Dr Bas Boots added: ""Although further work is needed, we believe it is the chemical composition of the filter that is causing the damage to plants. ""Most are made from cellulose acetate fibres, and added chemicals which make the plastic more flexible, called plasticisers, may also be leaching out and adversely affecting the early stages of plant development."" Fines for littering - including that of cigarette butts - are set by local authorities, rather than central government. However, the Depart for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs states that penalty notices for littering must range between Â£65 and Â£150, with the default fine being Â£100. The City of London - one of the authorities thatsets its fines at Â£150,external- says six million butts are littered on its streets each year, adding it spends Â£3.8m cleaning them up. In a bid to reduce the number of butts discarded on its streets, the City of London has installed 700 ""butt bins"" on walls and street lamps. It also offers free pocket ashtrays. Despite littering being a criminal offence, research by environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy suggests more than 10% of smokers do not consider dropping their butts to be littering. Allison Ogden-Newton, the charity's chief executive, said: ""These butts are toxic and plastic and cause significant damage when they get into our aquatic and marine environments. Now we know they are having an impact on our plant life too. ""It is time for smokers to take responsibility and bin their butts - not pollute our planet with them.""

"Public sector net borrowing rose sharply in June because of higher debt interest payments and rising spending on services, figures show. It totalled Â£7.2bn,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, up from Â£3.3bn in June 2018. It was the highest June borrowing figure since 2015, the ONS said. Analysts said the figures would add to the uncertainty surrounding the UK economy in the run-up to Brexit and the imminent change of prime minister. ""The outlook for fiscal policy was already uncertain because of the extension of Brexit until 31 October, in addition to the imminent change of Conservative leader and prime minister,"" said the EY Item Club. ""Much will depend on whether the economy can shrug off its current weakness, as well as on Brexit developments. It will also be influenced by any changes to fiscal policy by the new prime minister and chancellor ."" Last month, the government took in Â£800m more in tax and National Insurance contributions than a year previously, but debt repayments rose by Â£2.1bn. The ONS said there was ""a notable increase"" in expenditure on goods and services of Â£1.2bn, while the UK's contribution to the EU increased by Â£400m compared with June 2018. In the three months to June, borrowing was 33% higher than the same period in 2018 at Â£17.9bn. Public sector net debt rose to Â£1.81 trillion, or 83.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). The latest figures, which show public spending running ahead of forecasts, come as concerns grow over the state of the UK economy in the run-up to Brexit. The most recent GDP figures showedthe economy grew by 0.3% in Mayafter shrinking 0.4% in April. But economists say that June's growth figures will have to be strong to avoid contraction in the second quarter. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said borrowing would probably just stay within the rules set out by the current Chancellor, Philip Hammond. ""His successor, however, looks highly likely to tear up the existing rules, setting the stage for a giveaway Budget in the autumn and for fiscal policy to materially boost GDP growth next year,"" he added. ""The Conservatives are desperate to improve their poll rating and public support for austerity has crumbled, so a fiscal boost is coming."" On Thursday, the Office for Budget Responsibility saidborrowing could rise by Â£30bn a year in 2020-21if the UK leaves the EU without a transition deal on 31 October. The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment of the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy could contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond has indicated he may vote to bring down the next PM to stop a no-deal Brexit. Asked whether he would back a motion of no-confidence in the government, he said he could ""not exclude anything"". Mr Hammond also said he would do ""everything in my power"" to stop a future prime minister suspending Parliament to get a no-deal Brexit. He was one of four cabinet ministers who abstained from a vote blocking the possibility of this happening. The Commons vote was brought forward on Thursdayby MPs who fear the next Conservative leader and prime minister will make the move - known as ""prorogation"" - to push through a no-deal Brexit and cut them out of the process. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has discounted the possibility if he becomes prime minister, but his rival in the Conservative Party leadership race, Boris Johnson, has refused to give the same assurance. No-deal Brexit 'could cause Â£30bn economic hit' MPs ask EU to protect UK citizens in no-deal Brexit Scheme to block no-deal Brexit 'could involve Queen' The leadership candidates trying to stop Brexit In an interview withLe Monde,externalandSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, Mr Hammond said he would ""take steps to avoid an exit without agreement apart from an explicit parliamentary approval"". Speaking on Tuesday at the G7 conference in Paris, he told the French and German newspapers: ""There should be a new and sincere attempt to reach a consensus. ""If we do not find a solution with the members, we may have to ask the British to give their opinion again, in one form or another."" Asked if he would rule out supporting a motion of no confidence - which, if successful, would bring down the government - he said: ""I do not exclude anything for the moment."" It is a chance for MPs to hold a vote on whether they want the government to continue - and it has the power to trigger a general election. Any MP can propose a motion of no confidence, but that doesn't mean it would be debated. However, if the leader of the opposition introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time for a debate to take place. Read more about the process here. Mr Hammond also said another extension to Brexit was ""absolutely necessary"" in practice, as there was not enough time to renegotiate with the EU ahead of 31 October deadline. He added: ""If the next government is sincere in its desire to reach an agreement with Europe, it must try to get more time. If it does not, the British parliament will insist on getting a new postponement. ""I will remain a member of the House of Commons. I will do everything in my power from my position to make sure that parliament blocks a Brexit without agreement."" By Jessica Parker, political correspondent The so-called ""awkward squad"" - a group of Conservative Eurosceptic MPs - has for a long time made life tricky for David Cameron and Theresa May. With the pro-Brexit Boris Johnson apparently on the cusp of becoming PM, the expectation is that a chunk of the group could get government jobs. And the rest will surely hold fire on their new boss, at least for a while. Taking their placeâ¦ the ""Gaukeward squad"", named after current Justice Secretary David Gauke. The current projection is that it will be made up of Mr Gauke, Chancellor Philip Hammond and a good handful of other Tory MPs who avidly oppose a no-deal Brexit. Just how Gaukeward will they be? Mr Hammond's comments on potentially supporting a no-confidence vote suggest he - in principle at least - is willing to go pretty far to make his point. But is this just tough talk in order to let off some loud warning shots? We won't know until the crunch moment - if and a when Parliament finds itself confronted with the very real and immediate prospect of a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Mr Hammond said Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership race,  was ""a more complex personality than it sometimes seems"", and was ""a mainstream Conservative on all topics except Brexit"". But he pleaded for the EU to have patience with some of Mr Johnson's Brexit-backing supporters in the Conservative Party who were being ""deliberately noisy, rude and inconsiderate... to make the Europeans so tired that they ask us to leave"". He added: ""Please, do not listen to the the few noise-makers."" Pro-Remain Tory Dominic Grieve told the BBC that he thought a ""substantial number"" of his party would be willing to support a vote of no confidence in the government to stop a no-deal Brexit. He said: ""I'm going to be working with colleagues who share my view that no deal would be very bad for the country to try to make sure that the government cannot push us into no deal without Parliament having consented to it."" Health minister Stephen Hammond - who abstained in Thursday's vote - said he would not rule out supporting a no-confidence vote in his own government if its policy became pursuing a no-deal Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A lot of people were taught that you must put the interest of the country before yourself."" But leading Brexiteer and Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the same programme those trying to prevent it were ""not saying what they believe"", and their intention was to ""snub the British voters"" and stop Brexit altogether. He did, however, say prorogation was a possibility ""for a day or two"" to stop parliamentary procedures being ""upended"" by backbenchers trying to block the UK leaving the EU. If MPs fail to support a Brexit deal agreed between UK and EU by 31 October, the legal default is to leave with no deal on that date. Both contenders to be the next prime minister said they want to keep to the date and renegotiate with the EU, leaving with a deal. But Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have also said they would keep no deal on the table to strengthen negotiations, despite Parliament voting to rule the option out. The EU has consistently said the withdrawal agreement is closed and cannot be changed. The incoming president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said she hopes the UK remains in the EU, but it was up to British authorities to ""sort its side of things on Brexit"". Asked about Mrs von der Leyen's position, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she understood that ""if the UK wishes for more time [e.g. another delay to Brexit], then they would have more time"", but it was ""up to the UK"". She praised her ""cooperative relationship"" with Theresa May, adding: ""She has not had an easy time dealing with this difficult question. I always found her to be a reliable and collegial partner, and I thank her for that."" But she added: ""We now have the position that there will be a new PM, and then we have to watch what that person decides.""

"This video can not be played Kyoto Animation offices on fire Japanese police have named the man suspected of carrying out a deadly arson attack on an animation studio. Shinji Aoba was taken into police custody in hospital and was being treated there for burns. The fire swept through Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) on Thursday, claiming at least 33 lives and injuring many in one of Japan's worst mass killings in years. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas. Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouted: ""Die!"" In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (Â£1.04m) to assist victims and their families. KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions. Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive. Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidence Public broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from. ""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roof Around 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital. Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape. It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports said Kyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants â but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code. Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney."" ""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added. The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene. Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times. Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts. In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka. Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire. Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life. KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive art The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK. Arson attack at Japan anime studio kills 33 Kyoto Animation studio on fire.

"This video can not be played WATCH: ""It starts to look like censorship"" YouTube has defended its video recommendation algorithms, amid suggestions that the technology serves up increasingly extreme videos. On Thursday, a BBC report explored howYouTube had helped the Flat Earth conspiracy theory spread. But the company's new managing director for the UK, Ben McOwen Wilson, said YouTube ""does the opposite of taking you down the rabbit hole"". He told the BBC that YouTube worked to dispel misinformation and conspiracies. But warned that some types of government regulation could start to look like censorship. YouTube, as well as other internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter, have some big decisions to make. All must decide where they draw the line between freedom of expression, hateful content and misinformation. And the government is watching. It has published a White Paperlaying out its plans to regulate online platforms. In his first interview since starting his new role, Mr McOwen Wilson spoke about the company's algorithms, its approach to hate speech and what it expects from the UK government's ""online harms"" legislation. YouTube uses algorithms to recommend more videos for you to watch. These video suggestions appear in the app, down the side of the website and also show up when you get to the end of a video. But YouTube has never explained exactly how its algorithms work. Critics say the platform offers up increasingly sensationalist and conspiratorial videos. Mr McOwen Wilson disagrees. ""It's what's great about YouTube. It is what brings you from one small area and actually expands your horizon and does the opposite of taking you down the rabbit hole,"" he says. This video can not be played WATCH: Has YouTube helped conspiracy theorists thrive? ""Very often it doesn't take you to content that's exactly like the one you've watched before."" Even so, Mr McOwen Wilson says YouTube has started adding a sort of ""warning"" label to certain conspiracy topics. ""If it's misinformation, we provide correct information around that. We work with Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia to provide knowledge panels that come up on the side of the screen. So if you're watching a flat Earth video... we will present to you a link to the facts about that."" Facebook used to do something similar with fake news. It would label false stories as ""disputed"" with a red warning label, and offered up other sources of information. But the social network later said this had often entrenched people's pre-existing views and made the problem worse. ""We haven't found that,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. He says the platform reduces the spread of content designed to mislead people, and raises up ""authoritative voices"". He names BBC News, the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Sun as examples of authoritative sources. Some conspiracy theories - such as Holocaust denial -have been banned on the platform completely.,external In June, a row erupted between two YouTube video-makers. Vox reporter Carlos Maza posted a video showing all the times that comedian Steven Crowder had mocked him for being gay, or used insulting language attacking his sexual orientation and ethnicity. Mr Crowder said the videos were ""friendly ribbing"". After a series of muddled statements on Twitter, YouTube eventually confirmed that Mr Crowder had not broken its hate speech rules. ""Was the language used hate speech? Was there incitement against Carlos Maza from the other creator? In that instance, we found that there was not,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. ""I think that remains the right policy decision to have made."" That decision disappointed Mr Maza's supporters - and many of YouTube's own staff. More than 100 signed a petition asking for Google to be kicked out of the San Francisco Pride parade. Carlos Maza presents videos for Vox The language may not have been ""hate speech"", but critics argue that mocking somebody for being gay crosses a line into bullying. ""It doesn't currently breach our harassment policies,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. But he adds: ""We are inarguably pro-LGBT. I wouldn't want anyone to judge us only on that. I don't think it invalidates everything else that we've done."" He points out that YouTube has provided a platform for people to express their sexuality in a largely ""supportive environment"". ""I don't think any of that should be invalidated because of where we have drawn this line on the Maza-Crowder issue."" YouTube tells its video-makers that one key to success on the platform is ""watch time"": making sure viewers stick around for longer. Facebook, on the other hand, has been talking more about ""time well spent"" on the platform. It says it is more important that people have a good time on Facebook. How do the two approaches compare? ""One of the biggest and most positive steps that was taken on the platform, that drove down a huge amount of trashy content, was the shift from 'views' to watch time"", says Mr McOwen Wilson. YouTube star Etika's fans tattooed in his memory Welsh stone carver is unintentional YouTube star YouTube users can't stop streaming Latin Pop ""The best way for an audience to tell us whether they like what they're being served isn't whether they click on it in the first place, but whether they spent any of their time with it."" But does the system encourage video-makers to make longer videos, and draw out simple how-to clips into a 20-minute extravaganza? Mr McOwen Wilson says the videos which are most viewed are those that people watch in their entirety. And he adds: ""Clearly a longer one that is viewed the whole way through by the majority of its audience is more likely to come up."" The UK government is currently weighing up how online platforms such as YouTube could be regulated. In April, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said the ""era of self-regulation for online companies is over"". Is YouTube worried? ""The moment you put somebody in charge... there is somebody who is filtering what content goes out,"" warns Mr McOwen Wilson. ""If they're government-appointed, that begins to look very much like censorship, and we don't launch in markets where that is a risk. ""I don't think it would be the right answer to have anybody at YouTube - or indeed anywhere else - editorialising all of the content that comes up on to our platform."" Culture secretary Jeremy Wright says the era of self-regulation is over And either way, it would be impossible. About 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. The summer holidays have started - or are about to start - across the UK for thousands of children. ""By the time most of them go back to school, there will be more content uploaded to YouTube than has ever been created in the history of television or film globally,"" says Mr McOwen Wilson. He suggests a regulator could determine areas where online platforms should have policies, but the platforms themselves should create the policies. ""The world will be watching where the UK lands on this,"" he says. ""There are regimes out there who will mirror - in their own ways - the position that they view the UK has taken.

"On Friday 19 October, 1934, the passenger plane Miss Hobart fell from the sky to the sea. Eight men, three women and a baby boy fell with her, swallowed - it's believed - by the waters of the Bass Strait that lies between Tasmania and mainland Australia. The plane's wreckage was never found. One of those on board was a 33-year-old Anglican missionary, Rev Hubert Warren, who had been travelling to his new parish in Enfield, Sydney. His wife Ellie and four children had stayed behind, intending to follow by boat. The reverend's last present to his eight-year-old son, David, had been a crystal radio set that the boy treasured deeply. As a boarder at Launceston Boys' Grammar School in Tasmania, David Warren tinkered with the machine after lessons, learning what made it work. He charged friends a penny to listen to cricket matches, and within a few years was selling home-made copies at five shillings each. Young David was charismatic and a wonderful orator - a boy with star quality. His family, who were deeply religious, dreamed he would become an evangelical preacher. But that was not to be. The gift from Rev Hubert, Man of God, had launched a love affair with Science. It would prove to be of life-saving significance. By his mid-twenties, David Warren had studied his way to a science degree from the University of Sydney, a diploma in education from Melbourne University and a PhD in chemistry from Imperial College, London. His specialty was rocket science, and he went to work as a researcher for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), a part of Australia's Defence Department that focused on planes. In 1953, the department loaned him to an expert panel trying to solve a costly and distressing mystery: why did the British de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner and the great hope of the new Jet Age, keep crashing? He thought it might be the fuel tanks; but there were dozens of possible causes and nothing but death and debris as evidence. The panel sat down to discuss what they knew. ""People were rattling on about staff training and pilots' errors, and did a fin break off the tail, and all sorts of things that I knew nothing about,"" Dr Warren recalled more than 50 years later. ""I found myself dreaming of something I'd seen the week before at Sydney's first post-war trade fair. And that is - what claimed to be the first pocket recorder, the Miniphon. A German device. There'd been nothing before like it…"" The Miniphon was marketed as a dictation machine for businessmen, who could sit at their desks (or on trains and planes) recording letters that would later be typed up by their secretaries. David, who loved swing music and played the clarinet, only wanted one so he could make bootleg recordings of the jazz musician Woody Herman. However, when one of his fellow scientists suggested the latest doomed Comet might have been hijacked, something clicked for him. The chances that a recorder had been on board - and survived the fiery wreck - were basically nil. But what if every plane in the sky had a mini recorder in the cockpit? If it was tough enough, accident investigators would never be this confused again, because they'd have audio right up to the moment of the crash. At the very least, they'd know what the pilots had said and heard. The idea fascinated him. Back at ARL, he rushed to tell his boss about it. Alas, his superior didn't share his enthusiasm. Dr Warren said he was told: ""It's nothing to do with chemistry or fuels. You're a chemist. Give that to the instruments group and get on with blowing up fuel tanks."" David knew his idea for a cockpit recorder was a good one. Without official support, there was little he could do about it - but he couldn't get it out of his mind. When his boss was promoted, David pitched his invention again. His new superior was intrigued, and so was Dr Laurie Coombes, ARL's chief superintendent. They urged him to keep working on it - but discreetly. Since it wasn't a government-approved venture or a war-winning weapon, it couldn't be seen to take up lab time or money. Dr Warren said the chief superintendent had cautioned him: ""If I find you talking to anyone, including me, about this matter, I will have to sack you."" It was a sobering thought for a young man with a wife and two children. But his boss's backing extended to sneakily buying one of the precious new dictation recorders, and chalking it up as ""an instrument required for the laboratory…"" Encouraged, Dr Warren wrote up his idea in a report, titled ""A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents"", and sent it out across the industry. The pilots' union responded with fury, branding the recorder a snooping device, and insisted ""no plane would take off in Australia with Big Brother listening"". That was one of his better reviews. Australia's civilian aviation authorities declared it had ""no immediate significance"", and the air force feared it would ""yield more expletives than explanations"". Dr Warren was tempted to pack it all in. But his eldest son, Peter, says his father was stubborn, with a non-conformist streak that coloured his whole worldview. ""He took us skiing,"" he recalls, ""but he did the skiing in washing-up gloves, because he wasn't going to pay $30 for a pair of ski gloves. He wasn't the least bit afraid. He wasn't going to wait and follow the herd at all."" It was in that spirit that Dr Warren took to his garage and assembled his 20-year-old radio parts. He'd decided the only way to overcome his critics' mockery and suspicion was to build a solid prototype. It would be the first ever ""black box"" flight recorder. One day in 1958, when the little flight recorder had been finished and finessed, the lab received an unusual visitor. Dr Coombes, the chief superintendent, was showing round a friend from England. ""Dave!"" he said, ""Tell him what you're doing!"" Dr Warren explained: his world-first prototype used steel wire to store four hours of pilot voices plus instrument readings and automatically erased older records so it was reusable. There was a pause, then the visitor said: ""I say Coombes old chap, that's a damn good idea. Put that lad on the next courier, and we'll show it in London."" The courier was a Hastings transport aircraft, making a run to England. You had to know somebody pretty powerful to get a seat on it. Dr Warren wondered who this man was who was giving away tickets round the world to somebody he'd never met. The answer was Robert Hardingham (later Sir Robert), the secretary of the British Air Registration Board and a former Air Vice-Marshal in the RAF. In David's words: ""He was a hero. And he was a friend of Coombes, and if he gave away a seat, you took it."" A few weeks later, Dr Warren was on a plane bound for England - with strict instructions not to tell Australia's Department of Defence what he was really doing there, because ""somebody would frown on it"". In a near-unbelievable irony, the plane lost an engine over the Mediterranean. Dr Warren recalled: ""I said, 'Chaps, we seem to have lost a donk - does anyone want to go back?' But we'd come from Tunisia and it was about 45 degrees overnight. We didn't want to go back to that hellhole."" They decided they could make it if they ploughed on. He recorded the rest of the flight, thinking that even if he died in that limping transport plane, ""at least I'd have proved the bastards wrong!"" ""But unfortunately we didn't prang - we just landed safely…"" In England, Dr Warren presented ""the ARL Flight Memory Unit"" to the Royal Aeronautical Establishment and some commercial instrument-makers. The Brits loved it. The BBC ran TV and radio programmes examining it, and the British civil aviation authority started work to make the device mandatory in civil aircraft. A Middlesex firm, S Davall and Sons, approached ARL about the production rights, and kicked off manufacturing. Though the device started to be called ""the black box"", the first ones off the line were orange so they'd be easier to find after a crash - and they remain so today. Peter Warren believes the name dates from a 1958 interview his father gave the BBC. ""Right at the end there was a journalist who referred to this as a 'black box'. It's a generic word from electronics engineering, and the name stuck."" In 1960, Australia became the first country to make cockpit voice recorders mandatory, after an unexplained plane crash in Queensland killed 29 people. The ruling came from a judicial inquiry, and took a further three years to become law. Today, black boxes are fire-proof, ocean-proof and encased in steel. And they are compulsory on every commercial flight. It's impossible to say how many people owe their lives to data captured in the death throes of a failing plane - to the flaws exposed, and the safety innovations that followed. David Warren worked at ARL until his retirement in 1983, becoming its principal research scientist. He died on 19 July, 2010, at the age of 85. For more than 50 years, his pioneering work on the black box went almost unacknowledged.

"On Friday 19 October, 1934, the passenger plane Miss Hobart fell from the sky to the sea. Eight men, three women and a baby boy fell with her, swallowed - it's believed - by the waters of the Bass Strait that lies between Tasmania and mainland Australia. The plane's wreckage was never found. One of those on board was a 33-year-old Anglican missionary, Rev Hubert Warren, who had been travelling to his new parish in Enfield, Sydney. His wife Ellie and four children had stayed behind, intending to follow by boat. The reverend's last present to his eight-year-old son, David, had been a crystal radio set that the boy treasured deeply. As a boarder at Launceston Boys' Grammar School in Tasmania, David Warren tinkered with the machine after lessons, learning what made it work. He charged friends a penny to listen to cricket matches, and within a few years was selling home-made copies at five shillings each. Young David was charismatic and a wonderful orator - a boy with star quality. His family, who were deeply religious, dreamed he would become an evangelical preacher. But that was not to be. The gift from Rev Hubert, Man of God, had launched a love affair with Science. It would prove to be of life-saving significance. By his mid-twenties, David Warren had studied his way to a science degree from the University of Sydney, a diploma in education from Melbourne University and a PhD in chemistry from Imperial College, London. His specialty was rocket science, and he went to work as a researcher for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), a part of Australia's Defence Department that focused on planes. In 1953, the department loaned him to an expert panel trying to solve a costly and distressing mystery: why did the British de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner and the great hope of the new Jet Age, keep crashing? He thought it might be the fuel tanks; but there were dozens of possible causes and nothing but death and debris as evidence. The panel sat down to discuss what they knew. ""People were rattling on about staff training and pilots' errors, and did a fin break off the tail, and all sorts of things that I knew nothing about,"" Dr Warren recalled more than 50 years later. ""I found myself dreaming of something I'd seen the week before at Sydney's first post-war trade fair. And that is - what claimed to be the first pocket recorder, the Miniphon. A German device. There'd been nothing before like it…"" The Miniphon was marketed as a dictation machine for businessmen, who could sit at their desks (or on trains and planes) recording letters that would later be typed up by their secretaries. David, who loved swing music and played the clarinet, only wanted one so he could make bootleg recordings of the jazz musician Woody Herman. However, when one of his fellow scientists suggested the latest doomed Comet might have been hijacked, something clicked for him. The chances that a recorder had been on board - and survived the fiery wreck - were basically nil. But what if every plane in the sky had a mini recorder in the cockpit? If it was tough enough, accident investigators would never be this confused again, because they'd have audio right up to the moment of the crash. At the very least, they'd know what the pilots had said and heard. The idea fascinated him. Back at ARL, he rushed to tell his boss about it. Alas, his superior didn't share his enthusiasm. Dr Warren said he was told: ""It's nothing to do with chemistry or fuels. You're a chemist. Give that to the instruments group and get on with blowing up fuel tanks."" David knew his idea for a cockpit recorder was a good one. Without official support, there was little he could do about it - but he couldn't get it out of his mind. When his boss was promoted, David pitched his invention again. His new superior was intrigued, and so was Dr Laurie Coombes, ARL's chief superintendent. They urged him to keep working on it - but discreetly. Since it wasn't a government-approved venture or a war-winning weapon, it couldn't be seen to take up lab time or money. Dr Warren said the chief superintendent had cautioned him: ""If I find you talking to anyone, including me, about this matter, I will have to sack you."" It was a sobering thought for a young man with a wife and two children. But his boss's backing extended to sneakily buying one of the precious new dictation recorders, and chalking it up as ""an instrument required for the laboratory…"" Encouraged, Dr Warren wrote up his idea in a report, titled ""A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents"", and sent it out across the industry. The pilots' union responded with fury, branding the recorder a snooping device, and insisted ""no plane would take off in Australia with Big Brother listening"". That was one of his better reviews. Australia's civilian aviation authorities declared it had ""no immediate significance"", and the air force feared it would ""yield more expletives than explanations"". Dr Warren was tempted to pack it all in. But his eldest son, Peter, says his father was stubborn, with a non-conformist streak that coloured his whole worldview. ""He took us skiing,"" he recalls, ""but he did the skiing in washing-up gloves, because he wasn't going to pay $30 for a pair of ski gloves. He wasn't the least bit afraid. He wasn't going to wait and follow the herd at all."" It was in that spirit that Dr Warren took to his garage and assembled his 20-year-old radio parts. He'd decided the only way to overcome his critics' mockery and suspicion was to build a solid prototype. It would be the first ever ""black box"" flight recorder. One day in 1958, when the little flight recorder had been finished and finessed, the lab received an unusual visitor. Dr Coombes, the chief superintendent, was showing round a friend from England. ""Dave!"" he said, ""Tell him what you're doing!"" Dr Warren explained: his world-first prototype used steel wire to store four hours of pilot voices plus instrument readings and automatically erased older records so it was reusable. There was a pause, then the visitor said: ""I say Coombes old chap, that's a damn good idea. Put that lad on the next courier, and we'll show it in London."" The courier was a Hastings transport aircraft, making a run to England. You had to know somebody pretty powerful to get a seat on it. Dr Warren wondered who this man was who was giving away tickets round the world to somebody he'd never met. The answer was Robert Hardingham (later Sir Robert), the secretary of the British Air Registration Board and a former Air Vice-Marshal in the RAF. In David's words: ""He was a hero. And he was a friend of Coombes, and if he gave away a seat, you took it."" A few weeks later, Dr Warren was on a plane bound for England - with strict instructions not to tell Australia's Department of Defence what he was really doing there, because ""somebody would frown on it"". In a near-unbelievable irony, the plane lost an engine over the Mediterranean. Dr Warren recalled: ""I said, 'Chaps, we seem to have lost a donk - does anyone want to go back?' But we'd come from Tunisia and it was about 45 degrees overnight. We didn't want to go back to that hellhole."" They decided they could make it if they ploughed on. He recorded the rest of the flight, thinking that even if he died in that limping transport plane, ""at least I'd have proved the bastards wrong!"" ""But unfortunately we didn't prang - we just landed safely…"" In England, Dr Warren presented ""the ARL Flight Memory Unit"" to the Royal Aeronautical Establishment and some commercial instrument-makers. The Brits loved it. The BBC ran TV and radio programmes examining it, and the British civil aviation authority started work to make the device mandatory in civil aircraft. A Middlesex firm, S Davall and Sons, approached ARL about the production rights, and kicked off manufacturing. Though the device started to be called ""the black box"", the first ones off the line were orange so they'd be easier to find after a crash - and they remain so today. Peter Warren believes the name dates from a 1958 interview his father gave the BBC. ""Right at the end there was a journalist who referred to this as a 'black box'. It's a generic word from electronics engineering, and the name stuck."" In 1960, Australia became the first country to make cockpit voice recorders mandatory, after an unexplained plane crash in Queensland killed 29 people. The ruling came from a judicial inquiry, and took a further three years to become law. Today, black boxes are fire-proof, ocean-proof and encased in steel. And they are compulsory on every commercial flight. It's impossible to say how many people owe their lives to data captured in the death throes of a failing plane - to the flaws exposed, and the safety innovations that followed. David Warren worked at ARL until his retirement in 1983, becoming its principal research scientist. He died on 19 July, 2010, at the age of 85. For more than 50 years, his pioneering work on the black box went almost unacknowledged. Finally in 1999, he was awarded the Australian Institute of Energy Medal, and then in 2002 was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his service to the aviation industry.

"This video can not be played Kyoto Animation offices on fire Japanese police have named the man suspected of carrying out a deadly arson attack on an animation studio. Shinji Aoba was taken into police custody in hospital and was being treated there for burns. The fire swept through Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) on Thursday, claiming at least 33 lives and injuring many in one of Japan's worst mass killings in years. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas. Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouted: ""Die!"" In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (Â£1.04m) to assist victims and their families. KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions. Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive. Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidence Public broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from. ""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roof Around 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital. Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape. It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports said Kyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants â but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code. Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney."" ""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added. The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene. Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times. Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts. In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka. Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire. Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life. KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive art The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff.

"Noel Stanton, founder of the sect, preached about sins of the flesh Hundreds of former members of the Jesus Army are seeking damages for alleged abuse inside the religious sect. Ex-members have told the BBC how children suffered sexual, physical and emotional abuse on a ""prolific scale"", with most claims relating to incidents in the 1980s and 1990s. The Baptist sect is to close but is the subject of a renewed police inquiry. The Jesus Army has apologised to anyone ""who experienced harm in the past"" and urged victims to contact police. Ten people from the Jesus Fellowship Church - later known as the Jesus Army - have been convicted for various sex offences. Launched in the manse of a small chapel in Northamptonshire in 1969, the Jesus Army grew quickly in wealth and number. At its peak the JFC had more than 2,000 members, hundreds of whom lived together in close-knit communal houses throughout central England. It offered homeless or vulnerable people and god-fearing families the promise of ""new creation"" through a devout, all-encompassing way of life. Residents submitted to an intense regime of work and worship. All of their income was given to a common purse and everything was shared - from underwear to parenting. Children could be disciplined by any adult, while youngsters and newcomers were assigned to a male ""shepherd"" to oversee their spiritual development. The Jesus Army's brightly coloured buses took members to find new recruits By the age of 12 or 13, children were often separated from their parents. Ex-members say it was typical for adults to enter their bedrooms while they undressed, or watch them take a bath. The BBC has heard that children as young as three who misbehaved could be stripped from the waist, told to bend over and hold their ankles, and beaten with a rod. Community members lived under the unchallenged authority of the movement's creator, Noel Stanton. He was a firebrand who preached daily about sins of the flesh, and cursed wayward members as ""backsliders"" who were going to hell. Mr Stanton founded the JFC on a huge enterprise of shops, businesses and two large farms, generating millions of pounds in annual turnover. After his death in 2009, the church handed allegations of sexual offences against Stanton and others to Northamptonshire Police. The BBC can now reveal that 43 people who were active in the church have been linked to reports of historic sexual and physical abuse. It is understood further claims have come to light such as rapes, bullying, brainwashing, forced labour, financial bondage and ""barbaric beatings"" of young boys by groups of men. Jesus Army closes after child sex abuse claims Detectives have launched a new ""comprehensive"" inquiry into historic abuse by the church and evidence of a cover-up by five former leaders. However, a survivors' group has raised concerns about the level of compensation being proposed by the church. It is now preparing group legal action involving hundreds of claimants. A spokesman for the JFC insisted a formal redress scheme was being developed ""to provide money and counselling"" to ""those who had suffered poor treatment in the past"". It said the scheme had been set up with external stakeholders to ensure everyone was dealt with in a ""transparent and even-handed way"" New Creation Hall in Northamptonshire was the birthplace of the JFC ""I don't remember ever feeling safe as a child, I think people thought God would protect their children,"" says Rose, which is not her real name. She is one of a number of alleged victims who have told the BBC about their experiences inside the Jesus Army. Rose was a baby when her family moved to a commune in the 1980s. She says the intense regime made it a frightening place to grow up, with ""loud and scary exorcisms"" taking place at every meeting. ""I remember very strongly as a child a man manifesting next to me, shouting, screaming, retching and being sick on the floor,"" she says. Fervent sessions of worship were held in the evenings with songs, prayer and speaking in tongues, while most weekends were spent on recruitment drives in towns and cities. Followers donned military-style uniforms and drove rainbow-coloured buses. Rose explained that one of the main teachings was ""there is nothing good in you as a person"". ""Everything in you was the result of sin, and I developed a complete self-loathing because of that message,"" she says. Rose said children were regularly ""disciplined"" by adults, including homeless people and drug addicts picked up off the streets. ""There was something about public discipline... being whacked in front of a whole congregation of people, that was very humiliating."" Rose says that when she was 12 years old an older man in her commune began to groom and molest her ""every weekend"". She says he used to touch her leg under the dinner table or fondle her breasts while handing her money to get an ice cream. The Jesus Centre, former home of the group, in Northampton ""At the time, I didn't know what was going on,"" she says. ""I hadn't thought or talked about my body and he used that to molest me and continued to do it every weekend."" She knew the situation was ""weird and uncomfortable"" but felt ""he must have had a reason for doing it"". When she was 15 years old, she says another prominent figure in the church led her behind a building and forced her to perform a sex act on him. ""I knew something had happened that was wrong and felt a lot of shame,"" Rose says, but added that ""women were there to serve. We were always subordinate."" It was typical for women to be seen as temptresses who corrupted male members, former members said. So when her abuser told the church what had happened, Rose says she was blamed for it. She is now hoping to receive compensation from the church's redress scheme, and is considering going to the police about her alleged abusers. Ben says he was sexually assaulted at the age of six Ben, whose name we have changed, was born into the community in the 1980s. When he was six years old he says he found himself alone in the grounds of his commune with a male worshipper who undressed and sexually assaulted him. ""My dad's mum used to say how happy and smiley I was, but [after he was abused] I don't remember anyone ever saying that again,"" he says. ""The memories afterwards are all isolation. I withdrew into myself as a child and I had no friends in particular."" Ben became distanced from his family and left the church when he was 17 years old. Recently he discovered his siblings had suffered similar experiences, including one of his brothers who he says was raped during much of his teenage life. ""I believe that at least five of us have been abused in one way or another,"" he says. ""I have anger for the church. I have anger because of what they did to my family. Whether they chose to ignore it, or give it to God, they're still culpable for letting it happen."" ""There are still some beautiful people in the church with the best intentions,"" Ben adds. ""But everything's been overshadowed by what happened in the houses."" Ben has been speaking to police about pursuing a criminal investigation against his abuser, but says so far there has been little progress. Philippa Muller, far right, during her time in the Jesus Army Philippa Muller's family moved from Surrey to the birthplace of the JFC community, New Creation Hall, in Northamptonshire, when she was seven years old. Her father worked in the local tax office and handed over every penny of his earnings to the church's communal purse. Philippa's mother, like most of the other women, was a ""servant"" and spent her time cooking and cleaning to ensure the men of the house could do their ""godly work"". Philippa began living with the Jesus Army when she was seven Women were encouraged to claim benefits and give them to the church. ""I grew up with a very negative imprint as to what it was to be a woman,"" Philippa says. Young people were urged to recant their sins - real or imagined. They were taught about demonic manifestations and were present during exorcisms. Philippa became increasingly isolated. ""You couldn't just go to have a coffee with someone, or go to the cinema. That was all forbidden. ""We weren't allowed to socialise. We didn't have TVs. Things were censored... bits from the papers were cut out."" One of Philippa's close friends fled the church after she was assaulted by a male elder. Philippa became a key witness in the court case - in which the elder was convicted - but says she was ""persecuted"" by the church community which treated her as a traitor and liar. She left the church shortly afterwards. Now on the brink of closure, the Jesus Army is understood to have accrued assets worth Â£50m. But it leaves a harrowing legacy - and an unsettled future for Philippa and its many other victims.

"The airport was bought under previous Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money are being wasted on loss-making Cardiff Airport, a Tory AM has said. Darren Millar said the airport ""almost looks like a vanity project"" and must start generating cash, or be sold. The Welsh Government bought the airport in 2013 for Â£52m, after a steady drop in passenger numbers. It said it took over when ""widespread improvements"" were needed, and Cardiff was now among the fastest growing airports in Europe. In addition to the purchase cost, ministers have provided tens of millions of pounds more in loans, now being repaid, grants and further share purchases. Cardiff Airport's Â£6.6m pre-tax losses Flight tax might not be cut if devolved Flybe cuts routes in winter schedule Pre-tax losses in the 12 months up to the end of March 2018 were Â£6.6m, up on the previous two years. After five years of Welsh Government ownership, Clwyd West AM Mr Millar believes the taxpayer is getting a raw deal. ""It looks like we've had an airport that has been over-priced and is clearly under-performing,"" he said. ""Tens of millions of pounds worth of taxpayers' money have been wasted by the Welsh Labour government, and on purchasing an airport which almost looks like a vanity project."" But passenger numbers are now rising substantially, albeit from a low base and still below where they have been. Darren Millar questions the cash spent on an airport ""when schools and hospitals are on their knees"" The airport says securing new operators such as Qatar Airways are key to building new business. It also says a key performance measure looking at earnings before interest, tax, depreciation andamortisation,external(EBITDA) has gone into the black for the first time in eight years. A significant moment, but some investors remain cautious about placing too much emphasis just on that measure. Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder of Seven Investment Management, said airports were often seen as a ""status symbol"" for cities and countries. ""Be very careful what you are getting. An airport is a shopping mall with a tarmac attached to it for planes to land on,"" he said. ""So if you're just depending on planes you are going to need a lot of them going through, and currently in Cardiff not a lot are going through."" Simon Calder: ""Cardiff is having a tough old time"" Travel writer Simon Calder said Cardiff Airport was ""not doing brilliantly"". ""It's just in the top 20 of UK airports but Southend is challenging fiercely at 21st place,"" he said. ""Compared with Birmingham, which is about eight times larger, and Bristol, which is six times larger, Cardiff is having a tough old time. ""Those two airports are taking a lot of the traffic that might otherwise go to Cardiff."" Brian Morgan, professor of entrepreneurship at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said passenger numbers at Cardiff Airport were still ""nowhere near"" what they were 15 years ago. He said the Welsh Government's decision toscrap plans for an M4 relief roadwas ""disastrous"" for the airport. ""The airport needs to expand its catchment area eastwards... but there's a lack of a joined up transport strategy,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government owns the airport yet have taken a decision to cut off its main route for customers."" While most politicians agree they want Cardiff Airport to thrive, the big question is whether public ownership is the right way to make it happen and, if it is, how long should taxpayers have to wait to get their cash back. Cardiff Airport chief executive Deb Bowen Rees said: ""Financial performance has continued to improve with a positive EBITDA being achieved for the first time in eight years, alongside an increase in passenger numbers of 9% during that time. ""Cardiff Airport has been through a period of recovery over the last five years and has invested in developing our facilities and in relationships with airline partners with the key objective of creating a sustainable airport business."" She added: ""In terms of future ownership, we are focused on driving the sustainability of the business to deliver economic value to Wales."" A spokesman for the Economy Minister Ken Skates said Mr Millar's comments showed ""a startling lack of business awareness and pride in Wales"". ""We now have an attractive national airport that is amongst the fastest growing in Europe, with passenger numbers having grown considerably and consistently since we took control in 2013. ""This is a period which has coincided with the airport playing an instrumental role in Wales' successful delivery of major global events such as the Nato summit and Champions League final and attracting businesses such as Aston Martin to Wales,"" they said.

"Clockwise from top left: Gavin & Stacey, Love Island, Victoria and Happy Valley will be on BritBox Shows like Love Island, Gavin & Stacey, Gentleman Jack and Broadchurch will be on ITV and the BBC's streaming service BritBox when it launches this year. The broadcasters are joining forces to set up the subscription service in the UK as a rival to the likes of Netflix. It will cost Â£5.99 per month in HD, launching between October and the end of December. New programmes will also be made specially for BritBox, with the first arriving next year. Other existing series to be made available will include Victoria, Happy Valley, Les Miserables, The Office and Benidorm. The monthly fee will cover multiple screens and devices, ""which is less than other streaming services"", a statement said. Many ITV and BBC programmes will move on to BritBox after they have been broadcast on TV and fallen off the broadcasters' own catch-up services - BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.The BBC is soon expected to get permissionfrom regulator Ofcom to keep shows on iPlayer for a year as standard. This video can not be played What is BritBox? As well as recent shows, it will also be the home of thousands of hours of classic British comedies, dramas and documentaries. Not all BBC and ITV programmes will automatically go on BritBox, though. Many are made by independent production companies, who own the rights and might instead sell them to a service like Netflix after their TV broadcasts, as has previously happened with hits like Peaky Blinders. Some BBC and ITV shows that are already on Netflix,such as Happy Valley, will move to Britbox - but, again, it will depend on who owns the rights. The BBC and Netflix will also carry on co-producing programmes together as a way of sharing costs, especially for big-budget dramas. But BBC director general Tony Hall said BritBox was ""the prime place in which we want our material to end up"". BritBox - Â£5.99 for HD viewing and multi-screen viewing Netflix - Â£5.99 for basic package rising to Â£8.99 for a standard plan, including HD on two-screens. Ultra HD and four screen simultaneous viewing is Â£11.99. Amazon Prime - Â£5.99 on up to three screens simultaneously. Now TV - Â£7.99 for entertainment pass, with optional extras - Cinema Pass (Â£11.99), Sports (Â£33.99), Kids (Â£3.99) YouTube Premium - Â£11.99 Asked why viewers should pay an extra charge to watch shows originally funded by the licence fee, Lord Hall compared BritBox with releasing a programme on DVD. ""That was the BBC saying, there's a secondary market - you pay for content after we've shown it,"" he said. ""This is just a modern-day version of that, and an even better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you'd seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn't get hold of the DVD."" Any money the corporation makes will be put back in to programme-making, he said. ""I think this is wins all round for the licence fee payers."" The new shows to be made specifically for the new platform will be exclusive to BritBox, and the annual budget for original programming will be in the tens of millions of pounds. In comparison, Netflixreportedly spent $12bn (Â£9.5bn) on programmes last year,external. Broadchurch will be one of the shows on offer Normally rivals, the two broadcasters want to get a foothold in a fiercely competitive commercial streaming world against the likes of Netflix, Amazon and NowTV, while Disney+ and AppleTV+ are launching soon. The BBC and ITV tried to launch something similar a decade ago, butwere blocked by regulators,external. Now they are trying to catch up with their heavyweight competitors. Netflix has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide - but sawits share price plummet this week, after adding fewer viewers than expected in the last three months, with price rises blamed. The BBC and ITV launched BritBox in North America in 2017, showing programmes like Midsomer Murders, Poirot and Only Fools and Horses. It now has 650,000 subscribers, which ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said was ""exceeding its targets"". The BBC, which made a recent adaptation of Les Miserables, will own 10% of BritBox at launch, with ITV controlling 90% The bottom line is that BritBox is another way to attract eyeballs and to make money from the broadcasters' back catalogues. Dame Carolyn said the agreement to launch BritBox in the UK was ""a milestone moment"". She said: ""Subscription video on demand is increasingly popular with consumers who love being able to watch what they want, when they want to watch it. They are also happy to pay for this ease of access to quality content and so BritBox is tapping into this, and a new revenue stream for UK public service broadcasters."" ITV will own 90% of the new BritBox service and the BBC's initial 10% stake could rise to 25% in the future. Lord Hall insisted that this was not the first step toward changing the BBC from a licence fee-funded organisation to a subscription model. ""The fundamental funding for the future must be through the licence fee,"" he said. Friday's press release said ""viewers will want to subscribe to BritBox because it is uniquely British"", and that there is ""growing consumer demand in the UK for streaming services"". Five million homes have more than one subscription TV service - a growth of 34% per year. Former BBC executive Ashley Highfield said he thought the monthly price was ""about right"", and that BritBox would end up with subscriber numbers in the ""low millions"". He told BBC News: ""I don't think they think it's something that's going to take over from Netflix. It's probably going to rub alongside."" TV critic Emma Bullimore said she thought asking viewers to pay for mainly old content would be ""quite tough"". She told the BBC: ""I think in the long term it's going to be a success. In the short term I think it's going to be a bit of a struggle."" She added: ""It is bad news for TV fans in that we're going to have to pay for loads of individual subscriptions. Now, most people have their TV, maybe they have Sky and Netflix - whereas if you have to pay for Netflix, Amazon, Disney, BritBoxâ¦ it's going to get quite expensive."" Broadcasting analyst Tom Harrington from Enders Analysis said there is ""certainly a market for great British content"", but that BritBox might be a tough sell. ""You're going to get a lot of content that you've seen before, content that you think you might have paid for before, and content that's been free for possibly a year on iPlayer,"" he said. ""Why people sign up for services is usually for new, original content, and there will be a paucity of that on this service."" Its budget for original programming and technology will not rival those of the US streaming giants, he added. ""It's not going to be a Netflix killer. It won't take over Amazon in any way. What it will be is an almost niche service alongside those two, at best."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Whether it's almond, soy or coconut it seems more people are ditching cow's milk for the plant-based stuff. Almost a quarter of British people are now drinking non-dairy milks, according to market research firm Mintel, who spoke to 2,000 people. The biggest users of non-dairy milk are 16-24 year olds - 33% are drinking them. 23% of Brits used plant-based milk alternatives in the three months to February 2019, up from just 19% in 2018. But plant-based milks make up just 4% of the milk market, with 96% of milk sales in 2018 being for cow's milk. ""Concerns around health, ethics and the environment"" are driving sales of plant-based milks, says Emma Clifford, who looks after food and drink research at Mintel. Health was the reason why 37% of 16-24 year olds said they'd reduced how much cow's milk they've been drinking in the last 12 months. The impact on the environment was also a concern among that group - with 36% saying dairy farming isn't good for the environment. Which vegan milks are best for the planet? Fewer 16-24 year olds are buying cow's milk - down from 79% in 2018 to 73% in 2019, according to the research. ""With volume sales of cow's milk already on a downward trend, the fact that more young consumers are turning away from these products does not bode well for this segment's prospects in the long-term,"" Emma Clifford says. She also thinks young people should know the ""benefits"" of using cow's milk, and dairy more widely, in terms of health. Which milk is right for you? Sam Friskey and Thomas Forster co-founded a vegan plant-based protein shake brand ""I went vegan initially for health purposes,"" says Sam Friskey, who co-founded plant-based protein shake brand Fit Deli. He thinks the burnout and fatigue he used to suffer at work was largely because of his diet. ""Having made the shift I then began to understand about animal welfare and the planet."" Sam says there's ""such an array"" of alternative milks on offer that after trying them, ""you realise you don't have to compromise taste, texture or nutritional values"". And he thinks plant-based milks can act as a ""gateway"" to full veganism - cutting out all animal products from your diet. The questions everyone's asking Google about veganism Is social media behind the rise of veganism? Less than three quarters of 16-24s now use standard cow's milk, but it only makes up 4% of the market Despite the growth in the amount of people drinking plant-based milks, use in cooking and hot drinks remains limited. Only 25% use alternative milks in cooking, compared to 42% of cow's milk drinkers. When it comes to hot drinks there is a bigger difference - 42% of plant-based milk drinkers use them in hot drinks, compared to 82% who use cow's milk.

"Governments and business are having an unusually rocky set of relationships at present, from Brexit uncertainty to road, NHS and ferry contracts gone badly awry New light has been shed on the growing dispute over the building of two Hebridean ferries at Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde The client, representing the taxpayer, is hitting back firmly at claims that the new ships have gone Â£44m over budget because of post-contract interference But as this dispute heads for the Court of Session, the loser could be the Scottish government, having ploughed in Â£60m in loans, and with nowhere else in Scotland to build new ferries MV Glen Sannox was expected to be ready last summer New light has been shed in the mid-winter gloom on one of the disputes between government and business that look likely to be a feature of 2019. The big dispute, of course, is over Brexit.  It may have eased up for festive holidays, but be sure that the corporate warning klaxons are going to sound loudly as MPs return to Westminster. The year ends with a dispute over the insolvent Kaiam electronics plant in Livingston. The departed boss has told MSPs that he had warned Scottish Enterprise well in advance. He says the Scottish government agency did not do enough to avoid redundancies on Christmas Eve. That's while acknowledging that a cashflow bailout might not have been the wisest use of public funds. Just ahead of then, the Lanarkshire company which lost contracts to incinerate NHS body parts and other waste has ceased trading and sacked workers, in very unusual circumstances. And there's the Aberdeen bypass. I've heard from one major contractor that Transport Scotland could struggle to get firms to tender for future contracts, after the way this one has gone. In Whitehall, the Carillion collapse was an uncomfortable part of 2018. Another such large contractor Interserve is now the focus of concern, while Keir Group worryingly failed to persuade its investors to back it in a cash call. The year has ended with the absurdity of a freight company being contracted by the UK government to break through any cross-Channel Brexit logjams, despite having no ships. The default media narratives are either of profiteering business fat cats or of incompetent government ministers/officials. It's possible to have both, or neither. So I won't take sides in relating the facts of the looming legal battle over two Cal Mac ferries being built in Port Glasgow. The Scottish government has loaned Â£30m to the shipyard The Ferguson shipyard, where they are under construction, is a fine sight, even through the December dark in Port Glasgow. Decrepit sheds have been fully replaced, and plush new offices have replaced industrial brickwork. The signage points to a proud present and a confident future as much as a long past. Hull number 802 looms over the front gate. This is destined to be a ferry crossing the Minch between Skye, Harris and North Uist, updating an ageing Cal Mac fleet and expanding its stretched capacity. The other ship, Hull 801, the Glen Sannox, is alongside the quay, still far from shipshape for its Arran to Ayrshire crossing, and its delivery delayed. This contract is not a happy ship. Despite the appearance of a confident future with the red oxide paint on the hull, there's a lot of red ink in the offices. The decisions are now being made in East Kilbride, where the registered office is with Jim McColl's Clyde Blowers. He took the firm out of administration in 2014, in the closing days of the independence referendum, and was hailed as a hero by the SNP government. Four and a half years later,he has reported a Â£60m loss. Some companies can sustain a loss of Â£60m, particularly as they go through transition. But the figure is particularly alarming for a company which had revenue of only 30% of that loss, or Â£18m. Jim McColl said the buyer should meet the cost of any changes to the ferry contract The accounts for 2016, published just before Christmas (the 2017 accounts were already overdue) explain ""the Kaiser rule"" of 1:3:8 - working on a ship takes eight times longer when it's in the water than it does where the keel is first laid in the engineering shed.  It takes three times longer to do the same amount of work on the slipway. Ferguson Marine set out its problems in a lot of detail with the 2016 accounts, almost as if it wants to get its message across very clearly. One problem is that this is being built with what it calls a ""prototype"" dual-fuel (diesel and liquified natural gas) engine. The company is proud of being an innovator with hybrid electric-diesel ferries and plans to expand into hydrogen fuel. But innovation comes with risks, and marine certification can be a slow process on a ship where new ideas are being tried out. Ferguson says that its client, Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL) is responsible for variation, interference and disruption of the project after the contract had been awarded. From July 2017 to July 2018, Jim McColl was trying to get the Scottish government-owned company to agree that it should bear more of the risk of this.  It responded with evidence that the contract was clear about the risks being taken on. In a series of increasingly tetchy emails, partly exposed through a Freedom of Information request, those negotiations broke down and the dispute is in the hands of Ferguson's lawyers, soon to lodge their case in the Court of Session. The new ferries have been commissioned to serve Hebridean routes Yet while Ferguson wants the taxpayer to bear more of the burden of the cost over-run, it's already depending on the taxpayer for working capital. The accounts make clear that its finances are in some peril.  It can only be considered ""a going concern"" if a number of factors align favourably. Â£8.5m additional capital from Jim McColl's Clyde Blowers fund by April The extension of a Scottish government Â£15m loan beyond 2020, by which time it will carry a Â£5m interest charge Drawing down a further Â£30m Scottish government loan during January Getting 14% better productivity on Hull 802 than it got out of Hull 801 Nothing else major going wrong New contracts being won. For that, Ferguson talks of its part in a multi-yard bid to build the next class of Royal Navy frigates, plus fishing boats, fabrication for offshore energy, decommissioning of offshore energy and more contracts for the Cal Mac fleet. Those Cal Mac orders ought to be flowing already, given the problems of old boats and too little capacity. Being in a legal dispute over these two ships probably isn't going to make relations with CMAL any easier for talks on new contracts. And there's a perverse catch to that taxpayer funding. If Ferguson is successful in legal action against CMAL (which would then require funding from the Scottish government), it seems the contracts for these big loans require that they should be repaid. Some extra millions of ferry funding in: up to Â£60m in loans out. A further red light on this. The auditors, at Ernst & Young, are not confident they've got the whole story. Their notes with the 2016 account raise a question mark over the decision of directors to write down the value of the assets to zero. The auditors cannot see the basis for this assumption, when: ""We have not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered necessary for the purpose of our audit, and we were unable to determine whether adequate accounting records had been kept."" That Freedom of Information release provides insight into the looming legal battle, when Jim McColl's lawyers lodge a claim that the Â£97m contract price should be raised, with CMAL (the taxpayer) paying a share of the Â£44m loss on the contract projected by FMEL (Â£40m of that booked in the 2016 accounts). The Scottish government response carries the usual redactions at points when things look like they were about to get interesting. Jim McColl was keen to press his case back in July 2017: ""We are attempting to work through the cost impact areas with CMAL. However, we appear to be coming at this from different mind-sets"". Last March, in a letter to then transport minister Humza Yousaf, Mr McColl wrote ""We have been trying to engage with CMAL over the past year to discuss the significant cost increases resulting from the unforeseen complexities which have arisen."" Two weeks later, the Clyde Blowers boss was seeking to assert there were ""external circumstances which they [the contracting authorities] could not foresee when they awarded the contract.  We believe there have been..."" On 1 May this year, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay was reassuring CMAL that, yes, ministers were frustrated at the delays, but they believed CMAL was acting diligently and professionally. It's almost as if someone had suggested otherwise, amid the bits we are not allowed to read. Mr McColl later set out in more detail, ""unforeseen complexities and circumstances which have had a significant impact on the costs of completing the contracts... which would justify a price increase"". And then we get to the most interesting bit - a robust response, from Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd to Ferguson Marine Engineering: ""The contract into which you willingly entered was for a 'design and build'. ""During the tender process, FMEL put together a bid that was extremely detailed and held out to be competent to deliver, which we accepted leading to the contract signing,"" wrote CMAL. ""These two vessels are neither innovative or highly complex as you continually report. There are many dual fuel and LNG vessels currently in operation and many more currently under construction as succinctly pointed out by [redacted]..."" That's where the public information ends and the legal battle begins. It could get messy. To recap, Ferguson needs the taxpayer money to meet part of the contract overrun. It also needs big taxpayer loans to remain solvent beyond the end of January. It then needs further Cal Mac contracts. But if it's in such a messy dispute with Ferguson, and possibly for some time, CMAL is not well placed to sign new contracts. Nor is the Scottish government. But the Scottish government is under pressure to build more Cal Mac vessels. Ferguson Marine looks like the only Scottish shipbuilder capable of constructing them. The Scottish government would lose very significant loan funds if FMEL goes bust. And the FMEL directors' assertion (not backed up by auditors) that the assets are worthless will help focus the government's mind on that potential loss. Ministers would also lose politically if an acknowledged strategic industrial asset is allowed to fail. And as Jim McColl is the main figure on the other side of this dispute, he's not someone who can be easily portrayed as a fly-by-night profiteer. He's got some significant business heft. So what to do? Well, for me, it's an easy win among new year predictions. I'd say that this is one to watch.

"The delayed ferries are at the centre of a row between Ferguson Marine and the Scottish government's ferry company The shipbuilder with the contract to build two delayed CalMac new ferries has said it will lose Â£39.5m on the deal. The latest accounts for Ferguson Marine show the Inverclyde yard made a loss of Â£60.1m in 2016. Ferguson Marine claims ""interference and disruption"" from the Scottish government's ferry company is to blame for the losses. The firm also wants to renegotiate the terms of its Â£45m government loan. Owner Jim McColl - who rescued the yard from administration in 2014 - put Â£8.5m into Ferguson Marine from one of his other companies, according to the accounts. The two dual-fuel ships - which can be powered by liquefied natural gas as well as diesel - will operate on CalMac's  Clyde and Hebridean routes. They have been ordered by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL), which buys and leases the CalMac ships on behalf of the Scottish government. In its accounts, which were filed over a year late, Ferguson Marine stated: ""The directors believe that post contract award, variations, interference, and disruption caused by the customer have resulted in additional unforeseen costs."" But CMAL rejects this and has previously insisted Ferguson Marine has to stick to the terms of its Â£97m fixed-price contract. The row isset to go to the courts. The Ferguson Marine accounts state the contract row and losses ""may cast doubt on the ability to continue as a going concern"" for the yard, but the report also adds the firm- which employs 300 people - is confident that its diversification efforts will pay off. Ferguson Marine has been given access to a total of Â£45m in Scottish government loans. The firm is trying to renegotiate the terms of these loans and the Scottish government has also said it will enter into discussions over extending how much time the Port Glasgow yard has to repay one of the loans. Ferguson Marine's accounts for 2017 were due to be filed in September. A spokesman for Ferguson Marine said:  ""In our latest published accounts, we have provided for identified cost overruns, in line with accepted accounting standards. ""These cost overruns are a direct result of the unforeseen complexities of building the two prototype, first in class, dual fuel LNG vessels for our client, CMAL. We fully expect to recover the costs identified and are subsequently in discussions with professional claims experts, with the aim of submitting a formal claim to CMAL within the next few weeks. ""We firmly believe that following a period of remarkable transformation, which has seen significant investment into the yard's facilities and workforce, Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited is now well placed to embark on an exciting phase of sustained growth. ""Our diversification strategy has unquestionably led to recent project wins, including securing a contract to build a world-first self-propelled air cushioned barge, but has also created a huge pipeline of exciting opportunities in an array of different sectors which we intend to fully capitalise on.""

"Whether it's almond, soy or coconut it seems more people are ditching cow's milk for the plant-based stuff. Almost a quarter of British people are now drinking non-dairy milks, according to market research firm Mintel, who spoke to 2,000 people. The biggest users of non-dairy milk are 16-24 year olds - 33% are drinking them. 23% of Brits used plant-based milk alternatives in the three months to February 2019, up from just 19% in 2018. But plant-based milks make up just 4% of the milk market, with 96% of milk sales in 2018 being for cow's milk. ""Concerns around health, ethics and the environment"" are driving sales of plant-based milks, says Emma Clifford, who looks after food and drink research at Mintel. Health was the reason why 37% of 16-24 year olds said they'd reduced how much cow's milk they've been drinking in the last 12 months. The impact on the environment was also a concern among that group - with 36% saying dairy farming isn't good for the environment. Which vegan milks are best for the planet? Fewer 16-24 year olds are buying cow's milk - down from 79% in 2018 to 73% in 2019, according to the research. ""With volume sales of cow's milk already on a downward trend, the fact that more young consumers are turning away from these products does not bode well for this segment's prospects in the long-term,"" Emma Clifford says. She also thinks young people should know the ""benefits"" of using cow's milk, and dairy more widely, in terms of health. Which milk is right for you? Sam Friskey and Thomas Forster co-founded a vegan plant-based protein shake brand ""I went vegan initially for health purposes,"" says Sam Friskey, who co-founded plant-based protein shake brand Fit Deli. He thinks the burnout and fatigue he used to suffer at work was largely because of his diet. ""Having made the shift I then began to understand about animal welfare and the planet."" Sam says there's ""such an array"" of alternative milks on offer that after trying them, ""you realise you don't have to compromise taste, texture or nutritional values"". And he thinks plant-based milks can act as a ""gateway"" to full veganism - cutting out all animal products from your diet. The questions everyone's asking Google about veganism Is social media behind the rise of veganism? Less than three quarters of 16-24s now use standard cow's milk, but it only makes up 4% of the market Despite the growth in the amount of people drinking plant-based milks, use in cooking and hot drinks remains limited. Only 25% use alternative milks in cooking, compared to 42% of cow's milk drinkers. When it comes to hot drinks there is a bigger difference - 42% of plant-based milk drinkers use them in hot drinks, compared to 82% who use cow's milk.

"Schools and colleges in England need a ""multi-billion cash injection"" and a long-term approach to funding, say MPs on the Education Select Committee. Its report on school funding confirms the concerns of head teachers and teachers' unions who have protested about worsening budget shortages. The committee found that schools and colleges ""desperately need"" extra cash. A Department for Education spokeswoman accepted that schools were facing ""budgeting challenges"". ASCL head teachers' union leader Geoff Barton, said the report was a ""damning indictment of the government's dreadful record"" on school funding. Robert Halfon, who chairs the committee, said the report showed the need for a ""comprehensive, bottom-up national assessment"" of what it really cost to have an ""education system fit for the 21st Century"". The cross-party report says that schools have faced increased financial pressures from rising numbers of pupils and growing demands, such as supporting more pupils with mental health problems. School cash 'horse-trading' attacked by Greening Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap School spending on pupils cut by 8%, says IFS MPs say funding ""has not kept pace"" and the government needs to put in more cash. ""The government needs to cover the 8% funding gap currently faced by schools,"" says Mr Halfon, with the report saying this would require a ""Â£3.8bn uplift"". Further education colleges have faced particular problems, says the report, with per student funding falling by 16% in real terms over the past decade for the post-16 age group. The MPs say funding for this age group, in sixth forms and colleges, needs a Â£1bn boost, and the pupil premium, which gives extra support for disadvantaged youngsters, should be extended to 16- to 19-year-olds. The committee's report also calls for extra support for pupils with special needs and disabilities, to tackle a ""projected Â£1.2bn deficit"". There have been long-running protests by school leaders over funding shortages - including a protest march by head teachers through Westminster and letters sent to millions of parents. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who organised the WorthLess? school funding protest, said ""a cross-party group of MPs have validated what we have been saying all along - namely that our schools and colleges have been crippled by cuts and rising costs"". Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson has promised increased investment in schools - and there have also been claims that the Prime Minister, Theresa May, wants to announce a funding boost for schools before stepping down. Former Education Secretary Justine Greeningattacked the ""horse-trading"" over school funding, saying it should not be decided by short-term political pressures. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said spending cuts had ""left schools begging parents for donations just to keep the lights on five days a week and pay for basic supplies like pens and paper"". A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""While it is accurate to say that school funding is at its highest level, we do recognise that there are budgeting challenges. ""We are glad to see that school and further education funding is being highlighted as an important issue ahead of the next spending review, where the education secretary will back the sector to have the resources they need.""

"The airport was bought under previous Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money are being wasted on loss-making Cardiff Airport, a Tory AM has said. Darren Millar said the airport ""almost looks like a vanity project"" and must start generating cash, or be sold. The Welsh Government bought the airport in 2013 for Â£52m, after a steady drop in passenger numbers. It said it took over when ""widespread improvements"" were needed, and Cardiff was now among the fastest growing airports in Europe. In addition to the purchase cost, ministers have provided tens of millions of pounds more in loans, now being repaid, grants and further share purchases. Cardiff Airport's Â£6.6m pre-tax losses Flight tax might not be cut if devolved Flybe cuts routes in winter schedule Pre-tax losses in the 12 months up to the end of March 2018 were Â£6.6m, up on the previous two years. After five years of Welsh Government ownership, Clwyd West AM Mr Millar believes the taxpayer is getting a raw deal. ""It looks like we've had an airport that has been over-priced and is clearly under-performing,"" he said. ""Tens of millions of pounds worth of taxpayers' money have been wasted by the Welsh Labour government, and on purchasing an airport which almost looks like a vanity project."" But passenger numbers are now rising substantially, albeit from a low base and still below where they have been. Darren Millar questions the cash spent on an airport ""when schools and hospitals are on their knees"" The airport says securing new operators such as Qatar Airways are key to building new business. It also says a key performance measure looking at earnings before interest, tax, depreciation andamortisation,external(EBITDA) has gone into the black for the first time in eight years. A significant moment, but some investors remain cautious about placing too much emphasis just on that measure. Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder of Seven Investment Management, said airports were often seen as a ""status symbol"" for cities and countries. ""Be very careful what you are getting. An airport is a shopping mall with a tarmac attached to it for planes to land on,"" he said. ""So if you're just depending on planes you are going to need a lot of them going through, and currently in Cardiff not a lot are going through."" Simon Calder: ""Cardiff is having a tough old time"" Travel writer Simon Calder said Cardiff Airport was ""not doing brilliantly"". ""It's just in the top 20 of UK airports but Southend is challenging fiercely at 21st place,"" he said. ""Compared with Birmingham, which is about eight times larger, and Bristol, which is six times larger, Cardiff is having a tough old time. ""Those two airports are taking a lot of the traffic that might otherwise go to Cardiff."" Brian Morgan, professor of entrepreneurship at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said passenger numbers at Cardiff Airport were still ""nowhere near"" what they were 15 years ago. He said the Welsh Government's decision toscrap plans for an M4 relief roadwas ""disastrous"" for the airport. ""The airport needs to expand its catchment area eastwards... but there's a lack of a joined up transport strategy,"" he said. ""The Welsh Government owns the airport yet have taken a decision to cut off its main route for customers."" While most politicians agree they want Cardiff Airport to thrive, the big question is whether public ownership is the right way to make it happen and, if it is, how long should taxpayers have to wait to get their cash back. Cardiff Airport chief executive Deb Bowen Rees said: ""Financial performance has continued to improve with a positive EBITDA being achieved for the first time in eight years, alongside an increase in passenger numbers of 9% during that time. ""Cardiff Airport has been through a period of recovery over the last five years and has invested in developing our facilities and in relationships with airline partners with the key objective of creating a sustainable airport business."" She added: ""In terms of future ownership, we are focused on driving the sustainability of the business to deliver economic value to Wales."" A spokesman for the Economy Minister Ken Skates said Mr Millar's comments showed ""a startling lack of business awareness and pride in Wales"". ""We now have an attractive national airport that is amongst the fastest growing in Europe, with passenger numbers having grown considerably and consistently since we took control in 2013. ""This is a period which has coincided with the airport playing an instrumental role in Wales' successful delivery of major global events such as the Nato summit and Champions League final and attracting businesses such as Aston Martin to Wales,"" they said.
