"Liam Neeson has denied he is racist, after admitting he once set out to kill any black man who provoked him. The actor has been facing a major racism storm since he made the comments in an interview, published byThe Independent,externalon Monday. He had said he walked the streets with a weapon around 40 years ago, hoping to take out his anger after someone close to him was raped by a black man. But speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, Neeson said: ""I'm not racist."" Neeson added that he wanted his original comments to start a wider conversation about racism. Asked what he wanted people to learn from his experience, he told the host: ""To talk. To open up. ""We all pretend we're all politically correct in this country... in mine, too. You sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry and it's there."" The Hollywood star told ABC's Robin Roberts on Tuesday that around 40 years ago, one of his close female friends - who had since died - told him she had been raped. The Love Actually actor has starred in several revenge-themed films in recent years Neeson said it made him want to take violent action. He said: ""I had never felt this feeling before which was a primal urge to lash out, and I asked her, 'Did you know the person, was it a man?' No. 'Race?' She said it was a black man."" The actor said he ""went out deliberately into black areas in the city looking to be set upon so that I could unleash physical violence"". Neeson alongside Tom Bateman in Cold Pursuit He added: ""I did it maybe four or five times."" The Taken star claimed he would have acted in the same way if his friend's assailant had been white. He told ABC: ""If she had said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian it would - I know it would - have had the same effect. ""I was trying to show honour, to stand up for my dear friend in this terribly medieval fashion."" This video can not be played Former footballer John Barnes says Liam Neeson âdeserves a medalâ. Neeson said of his actions: ""It shocked me and it hurt me. I did seek help."" The actor said he went to confession and went power walking for two hours every day, to try to work through his anger. Neeson has been subject to huge criticism since his original interview was published on Monday. In that, he was speaking to promote his new film Cold Pursuit, a thriller about a man who seeks retribution after his son is murdered. Asked how his character turns to anger, he replied that ""something primal"" kicks in when someone close to you is a victim of violence. This video can not be played Listen to Liam Neeson's comments that sparked the outrage The Guardian's Gary Younge wrote,external: ""The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder, I need no longer brush the question away with disdain. ""I can say, with all sincerity: 'Because there may well be an Oscar-nominated actor out there who wants to kill me, so I have to be alert at all times...' ""Neeson is angry and upset and decides to invest his rage in the collective punishment of a group of people based on the colour of their skin."" But former England footballer and anti-racism campaigner, John Barnes, defended Neeson during an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He was ashamed a week into it. He understood that he was wrong for thinking what he did. ""And we have to have this conversation. ""Because there's so many people who have this perception, a wrong perception, of black people, Chinese people, based on what they have been wrongly told about them. ""It's understandable why he thought the way he did, because it's what the world has wrongly shown him."" He added that Neeson ""deserved a medal"" for admitting he was wrong so soon after the event. This video can not be played Playwright and author Bonnie Greer says Neesonâs race comments were a âsilly, stupid thing to doâ Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said Neeson's comments were ""completely inappropriate and offensive"" and to make them as he promoted a film was ""distasteful"". He told the BBC News Channel he was worried some of the reaction to the remarks ""seem to be absolving"" the actor and it ""should be about how deeply-seated these ideas still are"". Playwright and author Bonnie Greer said Neeson had ""probably put paid to his career"". She said: ""We are in an age where people are very sensitive and the fact that he doesn't understand what he's doing or what he's done is actually almost scarier than what he said.""

"This video can not be played Listen to Liam Neeson's comments that sparked the outrage The New York red carpet opening of Liam Neeson's latest film has been cancelled amid a row over his comments that he once wanted to kill a random black man after someone close to him was raped. Reporters were told the red carpet part of the Cold Pursuit premiere was being pulled with just two hours' notice. Neeson has denied he is racist but the remarks, published byThe Independent,externalon Monday, sparked an outcry. He said he had wanted to start a wider conversation about racism. Organisers of the red carpet event said there would be no photographs or interviews at the New York City screening. He was speaking to The Independent to promote Cold Pursuit, a revenge thriller. In the interview, he said the alleged rape took place a long time ago and went on to use racially offensive language about the attacker. He said: ""She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way. But my immediate reaction was... I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person. ""I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I'd be approached by somebody - I'm ashamed to say that - and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [uses air quotes with fingers] 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him."" He didn't go through with any violence, and added: ""It was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that... It's awful. But I did learn a lesson from it.""

"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival festival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival filmed her and branded her a ""drama queen"" as she lay dying, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie, was found dead in woods on the Bestival site in Dorset in 2017. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence, jurors heard. He denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. William Mousley QC, prosecuting at Winchester Crown Court, said the defendant had given his girlfriend the Class A drug 2CP while they attended the event in the grounds of Lulworth Castle in September 2017. ""He did not intend to cause her harm and Louella willingly took that which she was given, but it had a terrible effect,"" he said. Ms Fletcher-Michie died after a ""significant period of suffering"", he said, and Mr Broughton had continued filming ""when she was disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"" over several hours. ""He even did so, the prosecution suggest, after she was apparently dead,"" Mr Mousley said. In video clips shown to the court, Ms Fletcher-Michie repeatedly shouts at Mr Broughton to telephone her mother but he tells her to ""put your phone away"". Carol Fletcher-Michie eventually spoke to her daughter at 18:48 BST, growing concerned when she ""could hear her screeching"". Her parents were so worried they set off for the festival, repeatedly messaging and calling Mr Broughton, the prosecutor told the jury. Sam, her brother, also contacted Mr Broughton and urged him to seek medical help. However, Mr Broughton replied, saying ""call back in an hour"" and referred to Louella as a ""drama queen"", jurors heard. Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs The court was told Mr Broughton was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, a month before Ms Fletcher-Michie's death. ""His failure to get her treatment which may well have saved her life was borne of selfishness and in self-preservation,"" Mr Mousley said. ""Because to have done otherwise, to have acted positively, he knew would have exposed him to the possibility of arrest and prosecution for a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment."" ""Failure to act was a substantial cause of her death,"" he added. Stephen Kamlish QC, defending, denied claims Mr Broughton acted out of selfishness, saying he tried to carry his ""loving girlfriend"" out of the woods but failed because the terrain was hilly and full of thorns and nettles. He told jurors Ms Fletcher-Mitchie bought the drugs before Mr Broughton arrived at the festival and they could only find him guilty of gross negligence manslaughter if he had given her the drugs and she had been at an ""obvious risk of dying"". Mr Kamlish said no-one had ever been known to have died from taking 2CP. He added: ""Ceon and Louella were in love with each other and willingly chose to take drugs together. Mistakes, even serious mistakes... are nowhere near enough for a crime such as this to be guilty."" Jurors have been asked if they watch Holby City, which stars Ms Fletcher-Michie's father John Michie Mr Kamlish said Mr Broughton had tried to get people to his girlfriend at an earlier stage and had tried to restrain her when she was ""thrashing about, injuring herself"". He said: ""He couldn't actually have done any more than he did... in this difficult and frightening situation."" He told the court the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs. Mr Broughton, 29, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: My commitment to no hard border in NI is ""unshakeable"" Theresa May has said she wants changes to the controversial backstop but suggested she is not seeking to remove it from her Brexit deal. In a speech in Belfast, the prime minister restated her ""unshakeable"" commitment to avoiding a hard border after Brexit. Mrs May said the backstop's ""potential indefinite nature"" was the issue. However, Downing Street said the government was still considering alternatives. What is the Good Friday Agreement? Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Katya Adler: EU digs in its heels The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Analysis by John Campbell, BBC News NI Business Editor For some Brexit supporters in Mrs May's party the message is simple - bin the backstop. But in answers to questions after her Belfast speech, she seemed clear that a withdrawal deal will need a backstop of some sort. She said: ""There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure in the future there is provision for this insurance policy... the backstop. ""What parliament has said... is that they want to see changes to the backstop as it currently exists within the protocol, as part of the withdrawal agreement."" That may put her at odds with members of her own party who want radical change to the backstop. Addressing an audience of business leaders in Belfast on Tuesday, Mrs May said she was ""grateful"" to firms and farming groups who supported the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. Ultimately, that deal was rejected by Parliament, and the prime minister has now moved to ask the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement and allow legally-binding changes to be made to the backstop. Mrs May is due to meet the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Thursday. The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is to visit on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

The Democratic Unionist Party and Brexiteers believe the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and could leave the UK stuck with EU rules if a trade deal is not agreed. Earlier on Tuesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""toxic backstop"" remained the problem. The Republic of Ireland and EU have said there can be no renegotiation of the Brexit deal, or the backstop, leading to a rift in relations between the UK and the Irish government. On Tuesday, Mrs May said she wanted to strengthen the UK's ""unique"" relationship with the Irish government - including the ""tantalising possibility"" of a joint UK-Irish bid for the football World Cup in 2030. This video can not be played The EU must be realistic if the Irish border issue is to be resolved, says Arlene Foster In a gesture towards nationalist concerns, the prime minister said she had asked the home secretary to review cases concerning Irish citizens in Northern Ireland who have had difficulties bringing in family members. However, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Mrs May's visit came after she had ""performed a major U-turn"" over the backstop, an action she described as ""an enormous act of bad faith"". ""I heard nothing (from the prime minister) that would leave the community here to be in any way feeling in a better position than before her visit,"" she added. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI said business leaders were committed to ensuring a deal is ""landed"" Mrs May also met business leaders during Tuesday's visit. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said it had been a ""very useful meeting"". ""However, we are potentially 52 days out from Brexit so we need a deal and we need it now,"" he said. Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said that while it was a ""worrying time for business"" in Northern Ireland there was no choice but to ""stick with it"". ""If we can get an agreement whereby Northern Ireland firms can trade unfettered that's the ideal scenario,"" she said. She added that a positive from the meeting was that the PM ""gave the commitment again that she wasn't interested be putting any sort of hard border in Ireland"". In January,MPs overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal dealthat the government had negotiated with the EU, backing an amendment for the government to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop. The prime minister addressed this and said although she has said technology could play a part in managing the Irish border, it needs to work for the ""particular circumstances"" of Northern Ireland. Last July, Mrs May said no technology had been designed or implemented anywhere in the world yet to address the complexities of the Irish border. European Union leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the withdrawal deal as agreed. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking,"" he said. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said his party would not support any legal ""codicil"" to the withdrawal deal. Sinn FÃ©in Brexit spokesperson Chris Hazzard said he did not think the prime minister had ""any credibility at all"". This was a speech light on specifics. But it did feel like somewhat of an olive branch to those who feel frustrated by Theresa May's apparent U-turn on the backstop in recent weeks. The audience heard an appeal from Mrs May to strengthen Anglo-Irish relations, her ""unshakable"" commitment to peace in NI and a hat-tip to business leaders who backed her original deal. But the question of how the UK government intends to avoid a hard Irish border in its Brexit deal remains unanswered. Meanwhile, Lord Trimble, a 1998 Nobel Peace prize-winner for his role in the Good Friday Agreement, said he was ""exploring"" the possibility of a legal challenge over claims the PM's Brexit deal breaches the historic peace agreement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mrs May's deal ""turns the Belfast Agreement on its head and does serious damage to it"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Cost of printing May's EU deal revealed Brexit: A really simple guide A group of Leave and Remain MPs,the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, is in the middle of three days of talks aimed at finding other backstop optionsthat would avoid a hard border. Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions However, the EU has maintained that it will not re-negotiate the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop. MPs heading into a second day of discussions on the Irish border backstop on Tuesday Northern Ireland has been without its executivesince January 2017. Mrs May said that had not helped with the Brexit deadlock. She is working to restore it. She will meet Stormont's five main parties on Wednesday to discuss the political impasse.

"This video can not be played Are we on the cusp of a new nuclear arms race? Russia says it is planning to develop new missile systems after both Russia and the US suspended their involvement in an arms control pact. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banned both countries from using short- and medium-range missiles. Last week, US President Donald Trump announced the US would leave the pact, which it has long accused the Russians of violating. Russia then did the same. The moves have raised concerns about a new arms race. The INF was signed in 1987, during the Cold War, to ease a crisis in which US and Soviet missiles were placed within range of European capitals. On Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the aim was to create new land-based missiles within the next two years. Ground-launched missiles were banned under the INF, but not sea- or air-launched ones, which Russia already possesses. These can then be used to create the new systems. Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles Is nuclear control set to self-destruct? Mr Shoigu said the US was already violating the accord: ""[The US] are actively working on creating ground-based missiles with the range capability of over 500km, which is outside the treaty-stipulated limitations. ""In this situation, the Russian president has set the task for the defence ministry to take tit-for-tat mirrored measures,"" he said. The US is yet to respond to Russia's announcement butAP news agency last week cited Trump officials as saying there were no immediate plans to test or deploy missiles banned under the INF,external. The Trump administration has expressed concern at the threat posed by Russia as well as countries outside the INF, in particular China. Announcing that the US was suspending its involvement in the INF and would leave it completely in six months, President Trump said: ""We cannot be the only country in the world unilaterally bound by this treaty, or any other."" The US accuses Russia of several violations, including claims that a new Russian missile falls within the 500-5,500km (310-3,400 miles) range banned by the treaty. But Russia says it is the US that has broken the pact, and says Washington is using false allegations as a pretext to withdraw from an agreement it never wanted to be part of. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Given Russia is seen by the US as having already breached the INF treaty by its deployment of a ground-launched cruise missile, designated the 9M729 or SSC-8, Moscow is clearly ahead in the race to field this previously banned category of weapons. Reports suggest Russia could already have deployed up to about 100 of these missiles. President Putin is now talking about developing a ground-launched version of the successful Kalibr naval missile. He has also pointed to a potential hypersonic weapon on which the US believes Russia has been working for some time. So perhaps there is not much that is new here. The US itself is already allocating funds for new missile research and development. But the real arms race here could be in the Asia-Pacific rather than Europe, where both Russia and the US are wary of China's growing intermediate-range arsenal, which has never been restricted by any arms control agreement. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Putin warns Europe on hosting US missiles Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty plan US to leave nuclear treaty with Russia Russia denies breaking missile treaty US: Russia 'violated missile treaty' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

A spokesman said: ""We are working to redeploy as many people as possible into alternative roles but redundancies will be inevitable."" In its most recent results for the six months to 29 September, Brighthouse reported a rise in pre-tax losses to Â£22.1m from Â£19.9m in the comparable period. Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last year announced plans to cap the amount of interest that rent-to-own retailers charge customers.

However, the price of the household appliance can soon mount up because of interest rates that can reach 99% a year. The FCA has ruled that from April, the maximum interest paid will be no more than the cost of the product itself. So, if a fridge costs Â£200, customers will pay no more than Â£400. The price of the goods themselves will also be cut to no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers. Commenting on the closures, a spokesman for Brighthouse said: ""We will be speaking to all customers affected by the store closures and either transferring them to another local store or serving them online. ""We're also introducing PayPoint, allowing customers to pay BrightHouse in cash at 28,000 locations across the UK.""

"Daniel Williams was last seen leaving a bar at about 01:00 GMT on Thursday A body has been found in a lake in the search for a missing 19-year-old student, police said. Daniel Williams, from Sutton in London, has been missing since Thursday after failing to return home after a night out at the University of Reading. Police searching for him discovered the body in Whiteknights Lake near the university's campus. Thames Valley Police said the death was being treated as unexplained and was not believed to be suspicious. No formal identification has taken place, the force said, but Mr Williams' family has been informed. In response to the ""very sad"" news, the university said activities on campus would continue as normal and support would be available to students and staff. Allow Twitter content?

A major search, aided by search and rescue volunteers and the National Police Air Service, was launched over the weekend for second-year computer science student Mr Williams. Police said they had checked a lake and surrounding countryside on Monday. Search crews were seen searching Whiteknights Lake in a small boat until about 13:00 GMT on Monday. Student's disappearance 'out of character' Vigil held for missing university student Lead investigator, Supt Jim Weems, said recent snow had ""not hampered"" the search, but the night Mr Williams disappeared was ""one of the coldest"" of the year. A vigil was hosted on Monday in the Whiteknights campus bar, 3sixty, where Mr Williams was last seen. Police water search teams have spent two days in the lake Joe Campbell, BBC South The forensic team arrived just before 11:00 GMT and there were lots of police on the scene. A small group - including plain clothes officers and forensic specialists - gathered on the bank of the lake and were deep in conversation. The water search team has packed their equipment away, their job is done. Police have closed the nearby footpath, but the university campus remains open. Speaking before the body was found, the university's Anglican Chaplain Mark Laynesmith told the BBC students were in ""shock"". Acting vice-chancellor Prof Robert Van de Noort said support was being offered to Mr Williams' housemates and friends. Mr Williams' family described him as ""a happy, normal 19-year-old enjoying university life"" and said they had ""no concern at all"" about him before he went missing.

"Sajid Javid said none of those being deported was a British citizen, or a member of the Windrush generation Home Secretary Sajid Javid has defended the deportation of a group of people to Jamaica on Wednesday - the first such flight since the Windrush scandal. The people on the flight included 29 ""serious foreign criminals"" including a murderer and rapist, the Home Office added. Campaigners insist that some of them have been unfairly targeted. Some people, including an ex-Army soldier with PTSD, were granted a last-minute reprieve, a lawyer said. Campaigners claim the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy was to blame for the deportations and that many of the deportees had been in the UK since childhood. Those given a reprieve and not immediately being deported are believed to include a man who has applied to remain in the UK under the Windrush scheme. The scheme was set up to assess the cases of those who may have been caught up in the scandal involving wrongful deportations. On Wednesday afternoon, the Home Office said the chartered flight had flown to Jamaica, and the people on board had committed crimes with a total combined prison sentence of more than 150 years. The individuals on the flight - who numbered more than 30 - included 14 people convicted of drugs offences, six people convicted of a violent crime and one person convicted of dangerous driving. The Windrush generation is the name for an estimated 500,000 people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971. They were granted indefinite leave to remain, but changes to immigration law in 2012 meant many who arrived as children, without their own documents, found themselves unable to prove their status. Some were subsequently held in detention or removed, despite having lived in the UK for decades. Campaigner and solicitor Jacqueline McKenzie said: ""We are shocked that the government, not having received the conclusions of the Windrush Lessons Learnt Review, should resume these mass deportation flights which were stayed in light of the Windrush scandal."" None of Ms McKenzie's clients was due to be on the flight but she said she is in touch with lawyers who successfully worked to keep some of the group in the UK. Other than the man applying under the Windrush scheme, they include three who are due to give evidence to an inquest in March after witnessing the death of an inmate at Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre, Lincolnshire. Former soldier and father-of-five Twane Morgan is also believed to have had a reprieve. Some 91,000 people have signed an online petition supporting him. Who are the Windrush generation? How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Windrush scandal: Eligible victim denied help Former soldier Twane Morgan was due to be deported, but has been granted an injunction Mr Morgan, 36, was granted an injunction on Tuesday evening, meaning his case will be looked at again. He arrived in the UK in 2003 and joined the Army the following year. He was discharged in 2007 with post traumatic stress disorder after two tours of Afghanistan but had not served long enough to become eligible for British citizenship. His sister, Tenisha, said ""When he came out of the Army he didn't get any support or treatment, he was left to himself to integrate back into society and that didn't help, it made him who he is today - a shell of himself, zombified."" In 2011, Mr Morgan - who was living in Birmingham - was jailed for six years after assaulting a man. He served three. Tenisha added: ""I don't condone violence, whether it's my brother or not, but at the end of the day, had he got treatment I don't think this crime would have been committed."" Owen Haisley says he is being torn away from his family and if he had a British passport, he would be allowed to continue with his life Owen Haisley, a 41-year-old from Manchester, is also now understood to have had his deportation halted, according to his friends. His MP, Labour's Lucy Powell, tweeted that it may be a temporary reprieve and that she would ""continue to do all I can in this case"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Haisley entered the UK on his mother's passport as a four-year-old, and at the age of 11, was granted indefinite leave to remain. However, those imprisoned for a criminal offence lose that right and have to reapply, and when Mr Haisley did so after completing a jail term for assault in 2016, his application was rejected. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I hold my hands up to what I've done but I've served my time, I've done my prison sentence, I've done all my rehabilitation, I've done my community service. ""I've done everything that's been required of me, and [â¦] they're trying to tear me away from my family and my children and send me somewhere that I've never been back to. ""If I had a British passport and [had] done them [the] things and went into prison and came out of prison, I would have been able to continue to get on with my life and be normal like any other person. I just want to know why I can't get that second chance."" Mr Haisley has lived in Manchester for 29 years and said he didn't apply for a British passport as he previously had no need to do so. His children are aged five, seven and nine, and he says he will now only be able to see them in summer holidays, and over Skype, until he can apply to return in 10 years' time. Mr Haisley, who considers himself to be British, added: ""The fact they're trying to tear me away from my children and say I can keep in touch with them on the other side of the world on Skype, that's just outrageous. ""I don't think any father out there, any parent out there, would think that's acceptable."" David Lammy raised the issue in the House of Commons on Tuesday Home Secretary Sajid Javidsaid last year that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation- 32 of whom had been labelled foreign offenders - may have been wrongly deported to Jamaica. In the Commons on Tuesday, Labour MP David Lammy asked Mr Javid how he could be confident that none of the men due to be deported on Wednesday was also a victim of Home Office mistakes. Mr Lammy suggested the men were easy targets for deportation because of their race, asking: ""Why is it that in this country, black lives mean less?"" Mr Javid hit back, insisting that none of those being deported was a British citizen, or a member of the Windrush generation. The Windrush generation were named after the ship that brought the first West Indies immigrants to Britain in 1948 The Jamaican High Commissioner, Seth George Ramocan, said although it was ""the same community we are dealing with"" - the Jamaican community - it was important to be clear that there was a distinction between members of the Windrush generation and other migrants. ""Britain is a sovereign country... we have to abide by what the law of the land is,"" he added. However, Mr Ramocan had called for ""sensitivity"" and ""compassion"" in the case of Mr Morgan. The Home Office said it uses scheduled commercial flights for deportations but charters flights where this is not an option, especially involving foreign offenders.

"Mr Ahmad is said to have been arrested after watching Qatar play Iraq A Briton has been arrested and detained in the United Arab Emirates after reportedly being assaulted when he wore a Qatar football team shirt to a match. Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, from Wolverhampton, is said to have been unaware of a law against ""showing sympathy"" for Qatar - brought in amid a diplomatic dispute. His friend says he was held after telling police he had been attacked. The UAE embassy in London said Mr Ahmad has been charged with wasting police time and making false statements. Responding to earlier media reports, a UAE official said he was ""categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt"". The Foreign Office said it is providing assistance to a British man and is in touch with the UAE authorities. United Arab Emirates profile The UAE and four other countries in the region are currently engaged in apolitical and diplomatic stand-off with Qatarafter they accused the state of supporting radical and Islamist groups. On its website, theForeign Office warns travellers to the UAE,externalof a June 2017 announcement ""that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. ""Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine"". Mr Ahmad is said to have travelled to the UAE for a holiday. He was arrested after watching Qatar play Iraq in an Asian Cup match in Abu Dhabi on 22 January. Speaking to the BBC World Service programme Newshour, his friend Amer Lokie said Mr Ahmad had called him from a police station on 30 January to tell him about the arrest. Mr Lokie said: ""After he left the stadium he was followed by a couple of people and they assaulted him."" Mr Ahmad had been wearing a Qatar football shirt and was holding another one in his hands, he said. ""They took away his T-shirt and he went home. Afterwards he went back to police station to report the assault and they held him,"" Mr Lokie said. Asked whether Mr Ahmad had indicated whether the people who attacked him were members of the public, police or security officials, Mr Lokie said: ""I was trying to ask him to clarify but he could not clarify because his time was limited."" ""He was just a person who loved sport so much,"" Mr Lokie added. "" I don't think he knew he could get into problems for wearing a T-shirt or supporting a particular team."" The UAE embassy in London initially said it was unable to comment specifically on the case, adding ""allegations of human rights violations are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly investigated"". In a later statement issued through the embassy, a UAE official said Mr Ahmad was a dual Sudanese-British citizen. The official said Mr Ahmad had gone to a police station to say he had been harassed and beaten up by local football fans for cheering the Qatar team. ""Police took him to hospital where a doctor who examined him, concluded that his injuries were inconsistent with his account of events and appeared to be self-inflicted,"" the official said. They said Mr Ahmad was charged on 24 January, adding: ""We are advised that he has since admitted those offences [wasting police time and making false statements] and will now be processed through the UAE courts."" The tiny oil- and gas-rich Qatar has been cut off by some of its powerful Arab neighbours - including the UAE - over its alleged support for terrorism. The continuing rift meant there were very few Qatar fans in attendance during its Asian Cup matches. WhenQatar knocked the UAE out in the semi-final,objects and shoes were thrown at their players. Qatar went on to win the tournament, defeating Japan 3-1 in the final on 1 February.

"Stephen Waterson said Alfie Lamb's mother had told him she ""blamed herself"" for her son's death A man accused of crushing his girlfriend's son with his car seat used the fact his father is a former government minister to make himself ""untouchable"", a court has heard. Stephen Waterson, 25, is accused of twice pushing the front passenger seat of his Audi convertible into Alfie Lamb, who was in the footwell behind. The Old Bailey heard he told police he had ""powerful parents"". Mr Waterson and Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, 23, both deny manslaughter. The pair were in the car with two other adults, while Alfie and another child sat in the rear footwell during the journey from Sutton to Croydon in south London on 1 February last year. Jurors heard that in an interview with police, Mr Waterson name-dropped his adoptive father Nigel Waterson, a former MP and lawyer. Cross-examining Mr Waterson, Ms Hoare's lawyer Katy Thorne QC said: ""In that interview you used the fact you have got powerful parents, it seems to you, because you like to drop it into conversation all the time."" She accused Mr Waterson of using ""the fact that your parents are powerful people to make you untouchable"". Mr Waterson replied: ""I'm not untouchable."" Mr Waterson told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Mr Waterson told the jury he had not deliberately pushed the seat into Alfie after losing his temper but had moved it back no more than an inch, before moving forwards again. During cross-examining, Ms Thorne said to him: ""On your account Mr Waterson, it could not have been the seat that caused his death and you have been framed horribly for Alfie's death."" Mr Waterson replied that it was ""correct"". When asked by Ms Thorne how Alfie did die, Mr Waterson told the court: ""That's what I want to find out as well."" Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare both deny manslaughter Mr Waterson said the only thing that happened in the car to Alfie was that he was ""being shouted at by Adrian"", while Ms Hoare had told him she ""blamed herself"" for the toddler's death as they later lay in bed together. When he was asked if he bore any responsibility over the boy's death, he replied that he ""should have said something and not put the children in the car in the footwell"". Accused thought crushed boy was 'joking' Crush death boy injuries 'like car crash' Boy, three, killed 'for being too noisy' Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

"A leopard seal (file picture) A slab of seal poo used for scientific research in New Zealand has led to the unlikely discovery of a USB stick full of holiday snaps. The sample, known as scat, had been stored for over a year before being thawed out. Researchers analyse seal faeces to assess the health and diet of seals in New Zealand waters. The fully functioning stick contained images of sea lions and a video of a mother playing with her baby. The sample was submitted by a vet who had been monitoring a sickly-looking leopard seal on Oreti Beach, Invercargill, on New Zealand's South Island. The device was in good condition ""considering where it had come from"",external, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said on its website.

He said in that case his predecessor, Pope Benedict, was forced to shut down an entire congregation of nuns who were being abused by priests. It is thought to be the first time that Pope Francis has acknowledged the sexual abuse of nuns by the clergy. He said the Church was attempting to address the problem but said it was ""still going on"". Last November, the Catholic Church's global organisation for nuns denounced the ""culture of silence and secrecy"" that prevented them from speaking out. The Pope's comments come amid long-running cases of sexual abuse of children and young men by priests at the Church. Child sex abuse and the Catholic Church Profile: Pope Francis Speaking to reporters while ona historic tour of the Middle Easton Tuesday, the pontiff admitted that the Church had an issue, and the roots lay in society ""seeing women as second class"". He said that priests and bishops had abused nuns, but said the Church was aware of the ""scandal"" and was ""working on it"", adding that a number of clerics had been suspended. ""It's a path that we've been on,"" he said. ""Pope Benedict had the courage to dissolve a female congregation which was at a certain level, because this slavery of women had entered it - slavery, even to the point of sexual slavery - on the part of clerics or the founder."" Pope Francis said sexual abuse of nuns was an ongoing problem, but happened largely in ""certain congregations, predominantly new ones"". ""I think it's still taking place because it's not as though the moment you become aware of something it goes away."" The female congregation dissolved in 2005 under Pope Benedict was the Community of St Jean, which was based in France, Alessandro Gisotti of the Vatican press office told CBS News. In 2013, the Community of St Jean admitted that priests had behaved ""in ways that went against chastity"" with several women in the order, according to the French Roman Catholic newspaper La Croix. In a separate case in India last year,a bishop was arrested over allegations that he raped a nun 13 timesbetween 2014 and 2016. Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who headed the diocese in Jalandhar in the northern state of Punjab, has denied the accusations. In Chile, reports of abuse of nuns carried out by priests led the Vatican to launch an investigation last year. The women were reportedly removed from the order after highlighting the abuse. Last year, the Associated Press news agency reportedcases of abuse in Italy and Africa,external. Just days ago theVatican's women's magazine, Women Church World, condemned the abuse,,externalsaying in some cases nuns were forced to abort priests' children - something Catholicism forbids. The magazine's editor, Lucetta Scaraffia, said Pope Francis's acknowledgement of the abuse ""can be of some help"", but warned that the Church needs to act. ""If the Church continues to close its eyes to the scandal... the condition of oppression of women in the church will never change,"" she wrote. The magazine saidthe #MeToo movement meant more women were now coming forwardwith their stories. Last year, French websiteLe Parisien reported the case of ""Christelle"" (in French),external, a former nun whose name was changed to preserve anonymity. Christelle said she had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a priest of her congregation in France between 2010 and 2011. ""His gestures became more and more inappropriate,"" she said, adding: ""But he kept going... until the day he raped me. ""He was unable to control himself... he had a split personality.""

"Joshua Trump has been bullied for sharing a name with the president A schoolboy bullied for his surname - Trump - will attend the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Joshua Trump, an 11-year-old boy from Wilmington in Delaware, is not related to US President Donald Trump. But his parents say his classmates call him an ""idiot"" and ""stupid"" for sharing the Trump name. Senators and members of Congress also invite guests to the Capitol, with both parties using their choices to make clear political statements. Joshua, however, will beone of 13 people specially invited to the address,externalby the president and the First Lady. His parents, Megan Trump and Bobby Berto, told ABC affiliate WPVI last December that the bullying had started in 2015, when President Trump first announced that he was running for office. Despite sharing a surname, the president is not related After finding out he was being called names, they pulled him out of school and home-educated him for a year until he joined middle school. They hoped that he wouldn't be bullied in his new school, but he was. ""He said he hates himself, and he hates his last name, and he feels sad all the time, and he doesn't want to live feeling like that anymore,"" Ms Trump said at the time. A White House statement says that although Joshua has been bullied for sharing the president's last name, ""he is thankful to the First Lady and the Trump family for their support"". Other people invited by the president and First Lady includea survivor of a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, a young woman recovering from long-term substance abuse, and the family of a couple that were killed in a shooting last month - which was allegedly carried out by an illegal immigrant. There's no denying that there's a political message behind many of the guests the president has chosen. Mainly, he wants to make clear that he's tough on terrorism and immigration. But senators and Congress members from both main political parties are grabbing the opportunity to send messages of their own. Senators and members of Congress invite their own guests to the address at the Capitol Many Democrats and Republicans are bringing guests from either side of the border wall dispute - a cornerstone of President Trump's electoral campaign in 2016, which continues to be extremely contentious. Democrats Jimmy Gomez and Bonnie Watson Coleman have both invited former employees of Trump National Golf Club, who were reportedly undocumented at the time they worked there. ""President Trump justified shutting the government down for five weeks by demonising immigrants as the scourge of the country and the root of our nation's crime and insecurity,"" Ms Coleman wrote in a statement. ""Meanwhile, CEO Trump led a company that has relied extensively on the hard work of undocumented immigrants like my constituent... to keep his resorts clean and his putting greens trimmed."" Part of a fence at the US-Mexico border And Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, from Oregon, is bringing a mother and daughter from Guatemala who were separated for almost two months at the southern border last year. ""This child separation policy came from a dark and evil place within the heart of this administration,"" Mr Merkley said in a statement, adding that his guests would help the country ""bear witness to the suffering that this cruel policy inflicted"". Some Democrats have also invited transgender veterans, in response toa ban against trans people serving in the military that was enacted last month. Among them will be Tavion Dignard, a trans man who served in the US Navy for four years, and Logan Ireland, an air force sergeant who served in Afghanistan. Stacey Abrams to respond to Trump speech Migrants force-fed at Texas facility On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Tim Burchett have jointly invited a couple whose son was killed in a car crash - for which an undocumented migrant from Mexico has been charged. Republican congressmen Andy Biggs and Chip Roy are bringing border patrol officials. Mr Biggs has invited border patrol agent Art Del Cueto, while Mr Roy is bringing Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. But this isn't the first time politicians have used their State of the Union invites to make a statement. Last year, as well as wearing black to show their solidarity with the #MeToo movement, many Democrats invited people from the Daca and Dream programmes for undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as minors.

"This video can not be played The fire was brought under control in the early hours of Tuesday morning Ten people including a baby have died in a fire at an eight-storey building in south-western Paris, officials say. More than 30 people - including six firefighters - were injured. One person is in a serious condition. Fifty people were evacuated by ladders from the blaze in the upmarket 16th arrondissement. Investigators believe the fire - one of the most deadly in the French capital in years - was possibly started deliberately. A woman detained earlier by police is no longer being questioned and, after undergoing medical and behavioural tests, has been admitted to the psychiatric infirmary of the Paris police, media reports quote the Paris prosecutor as saying. Earlier,French President Emmanuel Macron said the country ""had woken up to tragedy,external"", and praised the fire services for their courage. Rue Erlanger is a residential street close to the Parc des Princes football stadium and the Roland-Garros tennis venue. The fire started on the second floor and spread across the block - built in the 1970s, unlike many of the older, classic Parisian buildings nearby - shortly after 01:00 (00:00 GMT), forcing some residents to scramble on to nearby rooftops to escape the flames and smoke. This video can not be played A survivor describes how she ""jumped across balconies"" to escape An eyewitness at the scene told French television: ""The fire alarm went off at 00:30, a little after midnight, and smoke was everywhere already. I live on the eighth floor, the top floor, so I tried to pass from balcony to balcony to get away, And then we huddled up in a corner. Other people climbed up to where I was to escape the flames."" About 250 firefighters were deployed to the scene, not far from the Bois de Boulogne park, helping to rescue those trapped on the roofs. Pictures showed flames coming from the top floor windows and firefighters in breathing apparatus scaling ladders to reach residents. Rescue efforts were initially hampered by the fact that the apartments on fire were inside an inner courtyard with no vehicle access. ""When we arrived, we were faced with an apocalyptic situation. Lots of people were calling for help from the windows,"" a spokesman for the fire service said. Firefighters said the building's courtyard had acted as a funnel, helping the flames to spread from the lower to the upper floors. Six firefighters are among the injured,external, officials say. The fire is one of the deadliest Paris has seen in years The fire was brought under control after a five-hour operation. Surrounding buildings in the area have been evacuated as a precaution. Town hall officials have been tasked with finding alternative accommodation. On Tuesday afternoon, architects working for the Paris police assessed the building and said there was ""a serious and imminent danger to the occupants"", who are therefore barred from returning for now. An investigation has been opened into the criminal charge of causing death by arson. Several local residents said the fire had started after a dispute between neighbours in the block over loud music. It was not immediately known what had caused the fire ParisMayor Anne Hidalgo sent her condolences to the victims, and visited the site,externalon Tuesday morning, along with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Just a few weeks earlier,four people were killed after a huge blast at a bakeryin the centre of the city. Hugh Schofield, BBC News Paris This is a well-to-do apartment building in an affluent neighbourhood. Other recent, deadly fires in Paris have been in poor, overcrowded areas where safety norms have clearly being ignored. By mid-morning, the fire had been extinguished and normal life was resuming. Sounds of children playing came from a schoolyard next door. The building is on an inner courtyard, so from outside there was no sign at all of the anguish and the drama. Firefighters were widely praised for saving 50 people from the building But groups of people were milling about, residents from neighbouring buildings who had been told to leave their homes. They wanted to know when they could go back. The occasional witness arrived who saw it all: the screaming, the flames, the people on seventh-floor window ledges staring into the void. They said they wouldn't ever forget.

"HMV's flagship - and original - Oxford Street store in central London has closed Canadian firm Sunrise Records has emerged as the buyer of collapsed music chain HMV, beating competition including Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley. The firm will buy 100 stores out of administration, securing 1,487 jobs. But 27 stores will close, resulting in 455 redundancies. Sunrise Records chief executive Doug Putman said he was ""delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK."" No price was given. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back on the changing fortunes of the high street music retailer The administrators KPMG announced that the company's flagship Oxford Street store in London, its first shop when it opened in 1921, is among the 27 outlets set to close. Ayr Bath Bluewater, Kent Bristol, Cribbs Causeway Chichester Exeter, Princesshay Fopp, Bristol Fopp, Glasgow Byres Fopp, Manchester Fopp, Oxford Glasgow, Braehead Guernsey Hereford Trafford, Manchester Merry Hill, Dudley Oxford Street, central London Queensgate, Peterborough Plymouth, Drake Circus Reading Meadowhall, Sheffield Southport Thurrock Tunbridge Wells Uxbridge Watford Westfield Shepherds Bush Wimbledon Canadian entrepreneur Mr Putman, 34, bought the retail chain Sunrise Records in 2014. He previously bought HMV's Canadian business in 2017, expanding his small chain into a national operation with 80 outlets. Can anyone make HMV successful? HMV: The rise and fall of a music icon HMV: Did streaming cause retailer to fail? Not all of the HMV stores will reopen Mr Putman is also President of Everest Toys, the largest toys and games distribution company in North America. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that HMV was a ""fantastic, heritage brand"". He also said the chain would be looking to stock more vinyl records, in response to customer demand. First successful business venture - selling fresh local produce - started aged 16. Bought Canada's Sunrise Records in 2014 - and expanded it. Took over HMV's Canadian locations after it went into administration. Mr Putman also owns a restaurant called The Granite in Bancroft, Ontario, and Makin Waves Marine, a boat dealer. His family also run Everest Toys, one of the largest toy wholesalers in North America. This video can not be played His deal will ultimately save 1,600 jobs, he tells the Today programme ""I feel really lucky to be able to say we [will] continue to call it HMV,"" he told the programme. There had been speculation that the shops might be rebranded as Sunrise Records stores after Mr Putman's rebranding of HMV's Canadian business. ""It is very clear that the customer wants more selection on vinyl, more depth of catalogue,"" he said. ""There's no doubt that online is a big part of overall retail sales. But people like to come into a store, have an experience, talk with someone who understands music, loves music, loves video and entertainment. If you think online is the only future I don't think that is the case."" He added: ""There is so much you get from coming into a store that you can't get online."" Robert Plummer, business reporter News of a successful rescue bid for troubled HMV couldn't come soon enough for staff and customers alike, although some outlets will unfortunately be closing. After the store chain suffered its second collapse in December, it has faced weeks of uncertainty, with no new supplies reaching its branches. That didn't matter so much in January, traditionally a lean time for music releases. But now February has begun, bands are putting out new albums again and their absence from HMV's shelves was starting to look embarrassing. On Monday, HMV's flagship Oxford Street store was unable to provide copies of the latest CDs by the Specials, Busted and Ian Brown, which had been issued at the end of last week. That means those albums are hard to find on the High Street right now, since HMV sells nearly a third of the UK's physical music product. Impulse buyers unable to walk out with those releases may well represent sales that are lost to the music industry forever - providing evidence of why record companies need HMV to survive. According to Canadian broadcaster CBC last year, his aim is also to tap into local tastes in music and store autonomy is important, he said. ""I think you lose something when everything's exactly the same,"" Mr Putman told CBC. ""Essentially every store has a different assortment. If metal is really big in that area, they can stock more of that."" HMV collapsed in December, its second administration in six years. Until now, Mr Ashley had been the likely favourite to take over the music retailer. As the owner of more than 60% of Sports Direct, he has bought retailers including the House of Fraser department store chain and Evans Cycles. His company also owns stakes in French Connection and Debenhams. A woman at the first listening booths in HMV in the 1930s HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges for the latest collapse. These include business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies. HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. However, the music industry expects physical entertainment sales to shrink by another 17% this year. Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator said: ""We are pleased to confirm this sale which, after a complex process, secures the continued trading of the majority of the business. ""Our immediate concern is now to support those employees that have unfortunately been made redundant."" One significant issue for physical retailers is rising rental and business rates costs, particularly at high-profile sites such as London's Oxford Street. According to real estate adviser, Altus Group, HMV saw its business rates bill for its flagship store on Oxford Street rise to Â£1,308,150 this financial year, almost double the amount it was paying before the controversial revaluation came into effect in April 2017. The store's rateable value is its estimated annual rent paid on 1st April 2015, and rose by Â£1.04 million to Â£2.55 million under the 2017 revaluation. A brief history of HMV.

Willow Sims, who moved to the UK from the US aged four, lost proof of her indefinite leave to remain when she was taken into foster care. Sajid Javid said he was ""concerned"" by the mother-of-two's story. Ms Sims said she hoped the Home Office would find a solution ""so that nobody has to not exist ever again"". She worked as a teaching assistant until last year, when she was subjected to a routine DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check by her employers.

She is now thousands of pounds in debt and reliant on food banks. Who are the Windrush generation? What should Windrush generation do now? Windrush: Who exactly was on board?

People of any nationality who settled in the UK before 31 December 1988 can apply to the taskforce for help securing proof of their status. But when Ms Sims rang the helpline she was told she did not qualify for assistance because she was not from a Commonwealth country. Later, after the BBC approached the Home Office, it confirmed she was, in fact, eligible after all. Mr Javid told MPs in the House of Commons on Tuesday: ""I am absolutely happy to apologise to her for the mistakes of the Home Office in not recognising the importance of her case right from the first moment she contacted the Home Office.""

"Police are questioning the couple over alleged abuse Two Russians have been detained in Malaysia over a street act which involved swinging their baby by the legs and throwing it up into the air. The pair are being questioned over alleged abuse of the infant, police told news agency AFP. A video of one of their performances has gone viral over the past days, prompting the police to act. The parents, in their late 20s, are travelling across South East Asia as buskers. The couple, who are in Malaysia on a month-long tourist visa, have defended the act. They told the Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news website that their child ""loves this exercise"". Five places tackling too much tourism Russia's risky gymnastics for babies The 90-second video was uploaded on Facebook by a user who described it as an ""irresponsible act that can literally cause injury"", urging police to arrest those involved. The clip shows a man holding a baby by the feet, swinging it between his legs and raising it above his head. He also throws the baby into the air several times, briefly letting go. Next to him are a group of other Europeans playing instruments and chanting. The Facebook post has been viewed more than 28,000 times. Facebook said it had not taken it down because ""it may help with rescuing the child in question"". The video can still be viewed online but with a warning that it ""may show violence against a child or teenager"". Bystanders were puzzled but didn't interfere Police detained the couple during another performance on a street in Kuala Lumpur. ""We detained them on Monday for questioning over the alleged abuse,"" Kuala Lumpur police chief Mazlan Lazim told AFP. He told local reporters the baby was unharmed, with no sign of injuries. Most comments on the Facebook post express shock at the treatment of the baby and that the parents use their child to make money. One comment sayssimilar baby gymnastics are legal in Russia. While controversial also in Russia, some believe the exercise helps babies develop more quickly. The Russian embassy in Kuala Lumpur told FMT they would contact the family. ""We feel it is not right to draw attention or behave in this manner, to swing the baby,"" a spokesperson said. Other social media users also express their anger that the couple appears to be travelling around South East Asia begging for money. There's been a growing trend of Westerners travelling in poorer Asian countries begging for money and other support to sustain their trip. Often referred to as ""begpackers"", they're increasingly a source of confusion or anger for local populations. Japan apology over death of abused child Why I founded Nigeria's first child helpline.

"Daniel Williams was last seen leaving a bar at about 01:00 GMT on Thursday A body has been found in a lake in the search for a missing 19-year-old student, police said. Daniel Williams, from Sutton in London, has been missing since Thursday after failing to return home after a night out at the University of Reading. Police searching for him discovered the body in Whiteknights Lake near the university's campus. Thames Valley Police said the death was being treated as unexplained and was not believed to be suspicious. No formal identification has taken place, the force said, but Mr Williams' family has been informed. In response to the ""very sad"" news, the university said activities on campus would continue as normal and support would be available to students and staff. Allow Twitter content?

A major search, aided by search and rescue volunteers and the National Police Air Service, was launched over the weekend for second-year computer science student Mr Williams. Police said they had checked a lake and surrounding countryside on Monday. Search crews were seen searching Whiteknights Lake in a small boat until about 13:00 GMT on Monday. Student's disappearance 'out of character' Vigil held for missing university student Lead investigator, Supt Jim Weems, said recent snow had ""not hampered"" the search, but the night Mr Williams disappeared was ""one of the coldest"" of the year. A vigil was hosted on Monday in the Whiteknights campus bar, 3sixty, where Mr Williams was last seen. Police water search teams have spent two days in the lake Joe Campbell, BBC South The forensic team arrived just before 11:00 GMT and there were lots of police on the scene. A small group - including plain clothes officers and forensic specialists - gathered on the bank of the lake and were deep in conversation. The water search team has packed their equipment away, their job is done. Police have closed the nearby footpath, but the university campus remains open. Speaking before the body was found, the university's Anglican Chaplain Mark Laynesmith told the BBC students were in ""shock"". Acting vice-chancellor Prof Robert Van de Noort said support was being offered to Mr Williams' housemates and friends. Mr Williams' family described him as ""a happy, normal 19-year-old enjoying university life"" and said they had ""no concern at all"" about him before he went missing.

"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival festival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival filmed her and branded her a ""drama queen"" as she lay dying, a court has heard. Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie, was found dead in woods on the Bestival site in Dorset in 2017. Boyfriend Ceon Broughton, 29, failed to seek help because he feared breaching a suspended jail sentence, jurors heard. He denies manslaughter and supplying drugs. William Mousley QC, prosecuting at Winchester Crown Court, said the defendant had given his girlfriend the Class A drug 2CP while they attended the event in the grounds of Lulworth Castle in September 2017. ""He did not intend to cause her harm and Louella willingly took that which she was given, but it had a terrible effect,"" he said. Ms Fletcher-Michie died after a ""significant period of suffering"", he said, and Mr Broughton had continued filming ""when she was disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"" over several hours. ""He even did so, the prosecution suggest, after she was apparently dead,"" Mr Mousley said. In video clips shown to the court, Ms Fletcher-Michie repeatedly shouts at Mr Broughton to telephone her mother but he tells her to ""put your phone away"". Carol Fletcher-Michie eventually spoke to her daughter at 18:48 BST, growing concerned when she ""could hear her screeching"". Her parents were so worried they set off for the festival, repeatedly messaging and calling Mr Broughton, the prosecutor told the jury. Sam, her brother, also contacted Mr Broughton and urged him to seek medical help. However, Mr Broughton replied, saying ""call back in an hour"" and referred to Louella as a ""drama queen"", jurors heard. Ceon Broughton, 29, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs The court was told Mr Broughton was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, a month before Ms Fletcher-Michie's death. ""His failure to get her treatment which may well have saved her life was borne of selfishness and in self-preservation,"" Mr Mousley said. ""Because to have done otherwise, to have acted positively, he knew would have exposed him to the possibility of arrest and prosecution for a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment."" ""Failure to act was a substantial cause of her death,"" he added. Stephen Kamlish QC, defending, denied claims Mr Broughton acted out of selfishness, saying he tried to carry his ""loving girlfriend"" out of the woods but failed because the terrain was hilly and full of thorns and nettles. He told jurors Ms Fletcher-Mitchie bought the drugs before Mr Broughton arrived at the festival and they could only find him guilty of gross negligence manslaughter if he had given her the drugs and she had been at an ""obvious risk of dying"". Mr Kamlish said no-one had ever been known to have died from taking 2CP. He added: ""Ceon and Louella were in love with each other and willingly chose to take drugs together. Mistakes, even serious mistakes... are nowhere near enough for a crime such as this to be guilty."" Jurors have been asked if they watch Holby City, which stars Ms Fletcher-Michie's father John Michie Mr Kamlish said Mr Broughton had tried to get people to his girlfriend at an earlier stage and had tried to restrain her when she was ""thrashing about, injuring herself"". He said: ""He couldn't actually have done any more than he did... in this difficult and frightening situation."" He told the court the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs. Mr Broughton, 29, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, denies manslaughter and supplying Class A drugs. The trial continues.

"Former student David Harding's gift to Cambridge is the biggest single British donation to a UK university A hedge fund billionaire has donated Â£100m to Cambridge University. The donation from David Harding, via his foundation, is the biggest single gift made to a university in the UK by a British philanthropist. The money will fund postgraduate scholarships for more than 100 PhD students and be invested in attracting students from ""under-represented groups"". Vice-chancellor Prof Stephen J Toope said it was ""extraordinarily generous"". The David and Claudia Harding Foundation funds scientific research and education A university spokesman said the David and Claudia Harding Foundation donation would help propelthe Â£500m fundraising drivelaunched last autumn to attract and support postgraduate and undergraduate students from the UK and around the world. Mr Harding founded the global investment management firm, Winton. His wife, Claudia is a trustee of the Science Museum Foundation. A Â£79m slice of the funding will go towards scholarships for more than 100 PhD students in residence, starting in October, around Â£25m of which will go to St Catharine's College, where Mr Harding studied natural sciences. Prof Sir Mark Welland, Master of St Catharine's College, said the investment would ""have a tremendous and permanent impact"" on the university as a whole. The remaining Â£21m will go towards undergraduate support and encourage further alumni philanthropy - Â£1m of which will also be invested in attracting students from ""under-represented groups"". Prof Toope said the gift would ""transform the lives of students"". ""This extraordinarily generous gift will be invaluable in sustaining Cambridge's place among the world's leading universities and will help to transform our offer to students,"" he said. ""We are determined that Cambridge should nurture the finest academic talent, whatever the background or means of our students."" Cambridge University has already set a target to increase the number of postgraduates in residence by 13 per cent from 6,500 in 2016-17 to about 7,400 by the end of 2021. The largest single donation to a British university prior to Mr Harding's was in 2000, when the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated $210m (Â£161m) to Cambridge University.

"A coastguard helicopter was involved in the rescue operation A man who fell ill at his remote Highlands cabin was rescued after the signal from his distress beacon was picked up in the US. The man, who is in his 70s and lives ""off-grid"", uses the device in its ""check-in"" mode every week to let his family and friends know he is well. On Sunday he triggered an SOS, which was automatically sent to a response centre in Houston, Texas. A coastguard helicopter and Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team went to his aid. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the man, who has no other means of communication other than his personal locator beacon, was found to be ""very ill"" from a potentially life-threatening head injury. Prestwick Coastguard helicopter crew was unable to winch the man directly from outside his loch-side cabin because of surrounding trees. Members of Lochaber MRT moved the man to a clearing where he could be winched to the helicopter. Lochaber MRT described him as one of their ""off-gridders"", a term used to describe someone with their own power and water supplies and usually grows their own food. The remote UK community living off-grid The SOS signal was picked up by the International Emergency Response Coordination Centre in Houston, which in turn notified HM Coastguard mission control centre (MCC) in Fareham. The coastguard team assessed the signal to be an emergency rather than the man's usual Sunday ""check-in"" with family and friends. After being winched to the helicopter, he was flown to a landing site at Torlundy, near Fort William, and then taken by ambulance to Fort William's Belford Hospital. Neil Blewett, UK aeronautical operations centre controller for HM Coastguard, said the man's rescue was an ""excellent result"". He said: ""When the man activated his beacon that signal went via satellite to Houston, which then gets sent to our MCC for attention. ""What must seem a very long way round for an alert to reach us is actually very quick thanks to the satellite technology that we use. 'In this case, the man's activation of his beacon, the satellites and the beacon itself saved his life because without any of those we would not have known he needed urgent help. ""We have since heard that the man is doing well and we wish him a speedy recovery so that he can return home as soon as possible.""

"Liam Neeson has denied he is racist, after admitting he once set out to kill any black man who provoked him. The actor has been facing a major racism storm since he made the comments in an interview, published byThe Independent,externalon Monday. He had said he walked the streets with a weapon around 40 years ago, hoping to take out his anger after someone close to him was raped by a black man. But speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, Neeson said: ""I'm not racist."" Neeson added that he wanted his original comments to start a wider conversation about racism. Asked what he wanted people to learn from his experience, he told the host: ""To talk. To open up. ""We all pretend we're all politically correct in this country... in mine, too. You sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry and it's there."" The Hollywood star told ABC's Robin Roberts on Tuesday that around 40 years ago, one of his close female friends - who had since died - told him she had been raped. The Love Actually actor has starred in several revenge-themed films in recent years Neeson said it made him want to take violent action. He said: ""I had never felt this feeling before which was a primal urge to lash out, and I asked her, 'Did you know the person, was it a man?' No. 'Race?' She said it was a black man."" The actor said he ""went out deliberately into black areas in the city looking to be set upon so that I could unleash physical violence"". Neeson alongside Tom Bateman in Cold Pursuit He added: ""I did it maybe four or five times."" The Taken star claimed he would have acted in the same way if his friend's assailant had been white. He told ABC: ""If she had said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian it would - I know it would - have had the same effect. ""I was trying to show honour, to stand up for my dear friend in this terribly medieval fashion."" This video can not be played Former footballer John Barnes says Liam Neeson âdeserves a medalâ. Neeson said of his actions: ""It shocked me and it hurt me. I did seek help."" The actor said he went to confession and went power walking for two hours every day, to try to work through his anger. Neeson has been subject to huge criticism since his original interview was published on Monday. In that, he was speaking to promote his new film Cold Pursuit, a thriller about a man who seeks retribution after his son is murdered. Asked how his character turns to anger, he replied that ""something primal"" kicks in when someone close to you is a victim of violence. This video can not be played Listen to Liam Neeson's comments that sparked the outrage The Guardian's Gary Younge wrote,external: ""The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder, I need no longer brush the question away with disdain. ""I can say, with all sincerity: 'Because there may well be an Oscar-nominated actor out there who wants to kill me, so I have to be alert at all times...' ""Neeson is angry and upset and decides to invest his rage in the collective punishment of a group of people based on the colour of their skin."" But former England footballer and anti-racism campaigner, John Barnes, defended Neeson during an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He was ashamed a week into it. He understood that he was wrong for thinking what he did. ""And we have to have this conversation. ""Because there's so many people who have this perception, a wrong perception, of black people, Chinese people, based on what they have been wrongly told about them. ""It's understandable why he thought the way he did, because it's what the world has wrongly shown him."" He added that Neeson ""deserved a medal"" for admitting he was wrong so soon after the event. This video can not be played Playwright and author Bonnie Greer says Neesonâs race comments were a âsilly, stupid thing to doâ Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said Neeson's comments were ""completely inappropriate and offensive"" and to make them as he promoted a film was ""distasteful"". He told the BBC News Channel he was worried some of the reaction to the remarks ""seem to be absolving"" the actor and it ""should be about how deeply-seated these ideas still are"". Playwright and author Bonnie Greer said Neeson had ""probably put paid to his career"". She said: ""We are in an age where people are very sensitive and the fact that he doesn't understand what he's doing or what he's done is actually almost scarier than what he said.""

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the news was a surprise to Mr Cantlie's next of kin. Previous statements by UK officials had hinted that the Briton was probably dead, and Security Minister Ben Wallace has not explained why he believes Mr Cantlie is still a captive. There is no new evidence or intelligence to suggest he is alive, our correspondent said.

"Stephen Waterson said Alfie Lamb's mother had told him she ""blamed herself"" for her son's death A man accused of crushing his girlfriend's son with his car seat used the fact his father is a former government minister to make himself ""untouchable"", a court has heard. Stephen Waterson, 25, is accused of twice pushing the front passenger seat of his Audi convertible into Alfie Lamb, who was in the footwell behind. The Old Bailey heard he told police he had ""powerful parents"". Mr Waterson and Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, 23, both deny manslaughter. The pair were in the car with two other adults, while Alfie and another child sat in the rear footwell during the journey from Sutton to Croydon in south London on 1 February last year. Jurors heard that in an interview with police, Mr Waterson name-dropped his adoptive father Nigel Waterson, a former MP and lawyer. Cross-examining Mr Waterson, Ms Hoare's lawyer Katy Thorne QC said: ""In that interview you used the fact you have got powerful parents, it seems to you, because you like to drop it into conversation all the time."" She accused Mr Waterson of using ""the fact that your parents are powerful people to make you untouchable"". Mr Waterson replied: ""I'm not untouchable."" Mr Waterson told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Mr Waterson told the jury he had not deliberately pushed the seat into Alfie after losing his temper but had moved it back no more than an inch, before moving forwards again. During cross-examining, Ms Thorne said to him: ""On your account Mr Waterson, it could not have been the seat that caused his death and you have been framed horribly for Alfie's death."" Mr Waterson replied that it was ""correct"". When asked by Ms Thorne how Alfie did die, Mr Waterson told the court: ""That's what I want to find out as well."" Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare both deny manslaughter Mr Waterson said the only thing that happened in the car to Alfie was that he was ""being shouted at by Adrian"", while Ms Hoare had told him she ""blamed herself"" for the toddler's death as they later lay in bed together. When he was asked if he bore any responsibility over the boy's death, he replied that he ""should have said something and not put the children in the car in the footwell"". Accused thought crushed boy was 'joking' Crush death boy injuries 'like car crash' Boy, three, killed 'for being too noisy' Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues. The court heard Alfie Lamb was in the footwell behind Stephen Waterson Accused thought crushed boy was 'joking' Crush death boy injuries 'like car crash' Accused 'cried out' after boy's crush death Crush death boy 'told to shut up by mum' Boy, three, killed 'for being too noisy' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Met Office issues 'hazardous' ice warning on roads across London after snow London crime statistics: Is knife crime worsening?

"Tributes have been left to the children close to the police cordon Sycamore Lane is a quiet cul-de-sac nestled on the outskirts of Stafford. But today it is filled with fire engines, police cars and emergency service personnel dealing with the wreckage of a burnt-out house. Hours earlier it was ravaged by a fire which claimed the lives of four children. A cordon, where journalists have gathered, blocks entry to the road. The mood is sombre as people try to go about their daily business. Residents from neighbouring streets stop and ask police officers what has happened. Visibly shocked and upset, many become tearful as the full horror of the events became clear. Four children die in house fire Emergency services workers remained at the scene of the fire today Some spoke of hearing screams while one witness described seeing a ""wall of flames"" out of the bedroom window. ""We just stood there with our hands over our mouths,"" another said. The remnants of the property are partly covered in blue tarpaulin. The roof has collapsed, the windows shattered and the rooms left blackened. Wendy Pickering and her husband Bryan said they often saw the family take the children to school Wendy Pickering and her husband Bryan said they often saw the family take the children to school. ""It is a real shock,"" she said. ""We heard screaming... it is just so sad."" People have started to lay flowers and teddy bears in tribute to the four children - named locally as Riley, Keegan, Tilly and Olly, and aged between three and eight - at the edge of the cordon. Firefighters helped place some of the memorials near the scene Friends and relatives visited the scene and shared tearful embraces.

"The Commission wants watches retrieved from owners The European Commission has ordered the recall of a children's smartwatch because it leaves them open to being contacted and located by attackers. In its recall alert,,externalthe Commission said the Enox Safe-Kid-One device posed a ""serious"" risk. Data sent to and from the watch was unencrypted allowing data to be easily taken and changed, it said. Enox said the decision was ""excessive"" and added that it had appealed against the ruling. The recall is believed to be the first issued because a product does not protect user data. ""A malicious user can send commands to any watch making it call another number of his choosing, can communicate with the child wearing the device or locate the child through GPS,"" wrote the Commission in its alert notice. It has directed public authorities across Europe to recall the product from end users. Enox founder Ole Anton Bieltvedt told the BBC that the watch had passed tests carried out by German regulators last year allowing it to be sold. The version the Commission tested was no longer on sale, he added. Enox planned to lodge an appeal with Iceland's consumer protection regulator which had complained about the watch to the Commission. Mr Bieltvedt said Enox's distributor in Iceland had made a ""strong protest"" and ""they have appealed to the authorities in charge with the demand that this test conclusion would be reversed"". The Enox device comes fitted with GPS, a microphone and speaker and has a companion app that lets parents oversee the location of the wearer and contact them. Tests by security researchers on popular smartwatches aimed at children last year revealed some of their shortcomings. The security experts found it waseasy to track childrenas the watches did a poor job of encrypting data or checking who was logging information. In November 2017,Germany banned smartwatchesfor children saying they were ""spying devices"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May: My commitment to no hard border in NI is ""unshakeable"" Theresa May has said she wants changes to the controversial backstop but suggested she is not seeking to remove it from her Brexit deal. In a speech in Belfast, the prime minister restated her ""unshakeable"" commitment to avoiding a hard border after Brexit. Mrs May said the backstop's ""potential indefinite nature"" was the issue. However, Downing Street said the government was still considering alternatives. What is the Good Friday Agreement? Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Katya Adler: EU digs in its heels The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Analysis by John Campbell, BBC News NI Business Editor For some Brexit supporters in Mrs May's party the message is simple - bin the backstop. But in answers to questions after her Belfast speech, she seemed clear that a withdrawal deal will need a backstop of some sort. She said: ""There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure in the future there is provision for this insurance policy... the backstop. ""What parliament has said... is that they want to see changes to the backstop as it currently exists within the protocol, as part of the withdrawal agreement."" That may put her at odds with members of her own party who want radical change to the backstop. Addressing an audience of business leaders in Belfast on Tuesday, Mrs May said she was ""grateful"" to firms and farming groups who supported the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. Ultimately, that deal was rejected by Parliament, and the prime minister has now moved to ask the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement and allow legally-binding changes to be made to the backstop. Mrs May is due to meet the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Thursday. The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is to visit on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

The Democratic Unionist Party and Brexiteers believe the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and could leave the UK stuck with EU rules if a trade deal is not agreed. Earlier on Tuesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""toxic backstop"" remained the problem. The Republic of Ireland and EU have said there can be no renegotiation of the Brexit deal, or the backstop, leading to a rift in relations between the UK and the Irish government. On Tuesday, Mrs May said she wanted to strengthen the UK's ""unique"" relationship with the Irish government - including the ""tantalising possibility"" of a joint UK-Irish bid for the football World Cup in 2030. This video can not be played The EU must be realistic if the Irish border issue is to be resolved, says Arlene Foster In a gesture towards nationalist concerns, the prime minister said she had asked the home secretary to review cases concerning Irish citizens in Northern Ireland who have had difficulties bringing in family members. However, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Mrs May's visit came after she had ""performed a major U-turn"" over the backstop, an action she described as ""an enormous act of bad faith"". ""I heard nothing (from the prime minister) that would leave the community here to be in any way feeling in a better position than before her visit,"" she added. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI said business leaders were committed to ensuring a deal is ""landed"" Mrs May also met business leaders during Tuesday's visit. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said it had been a ""very useful meeting"". ""However, we are potentially 52 days out from Brexit so we need a deal and we need it now,"" he said. Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said that while it was a ""worrying time for business"" in Northern Ireland there was no choice but to ""stick with it"". ""If we can get an agreement whereby Northern Ireland firms can trade unfettered that's the ideal scenario,"" she said. She added that a positive from the meeting was that the PM ""gave the commitment again that she wasn't interested be putting any sort of hard border in Ireland"". In January,MPs overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal dealthat the government had negotiated with the EU, backing an amendment for the government to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop. The prime minister addressed this and said although she has said technology could play a part in managing the Irish border, it needs to work for the ""particular circumstances"" of Northern Ireland. Last July, Mrs May said no technology had been designed or implemented anywhere in the world yet to address the complexities of the Irish border. European Union leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the withdrawal deal as agreed. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking,"" he said. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said his party would not support any legal ""codicil"" to the withdrawal deal. Sinn FÃ©in Brexit spokesperson Chris Hazzard said he did not think the prime minister had ""any credibility at all"". This was a speech light on specifics. But it did feel like somewhat of an olive branch to those who feel frustrated by Theresa May's apparent U-turn on the backstop in recent weeks. The audience heard an appeal from Mrs May to strengthen Anglo-Irish relations, her ""unshakable"" commitment to peace in NI and a hat-tip to business leaders who backed her original deal. But the question of how the UK government intends to avoid a hard Irish border in its Brexit deal remains unanswered. Meanwhile, Lord Trimble, a 1998 Nobel Peace prize-winner for his role in the Good Friday Agreement, said he was ""exploring"" the possibility of a legal challenge over claims the PM's Brexit deal breaches the historic peace agreement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mrs May's deal ""turns the Belfast Agreement on its head and does serious damage to it"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Cost of printing May's EU deal revealed Brexit: A really simple guide A group of Leave and Remain MPs,the Alternative Arrangements Working Group, is in the middle of three days of talks aimed at finding other backstop optionsthat would avoid a hard border. Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions However, the EU has maintained that it will not re-negotiate the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop. MPs heading into a second day of discussions on the Irish border backstop on Tuesday Northern Ireland has been without its executivesince January 2017. Mrs May said that had not helped with the Brexit deadlock. She is working to restore it. She will meet Stormont's five main parties on Wednesday to discuss the political impasse.

"Liam Neeson has denied he is racist, after admitting he once set out to kill any black man who provoked him. The actor has been facing a major racism storm since he made the comments in an interview, published byThe Independent,externalon Monday. He had said he walked the streets with a weapon around 40 years ago, hoping to take out his anger after someone close to him was raped by a black man. But speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, Neeson said: ""I'm not racist."" Neeson added that he wanted his original comments to start a wider conversation about racism. Asked what he wanted people to learn from his experience, he told the host: ""To talk. To open up. ""We all pretend we're all politically correct in this country... in mine, too. You sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry and it's there."" The Hollywood star told ABC's Robin Roberts on Tuesday that around 40 years ago, one of his close female friends - who had since died - told him she had been raped. The Love Actually actor has starred in several revenge-themed films in recent years Neeson said it made him want to take violent action. He said: ""I had never felt this feeling before which was a primal urge to lash out, and I asked her, 'Did you know the person, was it a man?' No. 'Race?' She said it was a black man."" The actor said he ""went out deliberately into black areas in the city looking to be set upon so that I could unleash physical violence"". Neeson alongside Tom Bateman in Cold Pursuit He added: ""I did it maybe four or five times."" The Taken star claimed he would have acted in the same way if his friend's assailant had been white. He told ABC: ""If she had said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian it would - I know it would - have had the same effect. ""I was trying to show honour, to stand up for my dear friend in this terribly medieval fashion."" This video can not be played Former footballer John Barnes says Liam Neeson âdeserves a medalâ. Neeson said of his actions: ""It shocked me and it hurt me. I did seek help."" The actor said he went to confession and went power walking for two hours every day, to try to work through his anger. Neeson has been subject to huge criticism since his original interview was published on Monday. In that, he was speaking to promote his new film Cold Pursuit, a thriller about a man who seeks retribution after his son is murdered. Asked how his character turns to anger, he replied that ""something primal"" kicks in when someone close to you is a victim of violence. This video can not be played Listen to Liam Neeson's comments that sparked the outrage The Guardian's Gary Younge wrote,external: ""The next time someone asks me why I have a chip on my shoulder, I need no longer brush the question away with disdain. ""I can say, with all sincerity: 'Because there may well be an Oscar-nominated actor out there who wants to kill me, so I have to be alert at all times...' ""Neeson is angry and upset and decides to invest his rage in the collective punishment of a group of people based on the colour of their skin."" But former England footballer and anti-racism campaigner, John Barnes, defended Neeson during an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He was ashamed a week into it. He understood that he was wrong for thinking what he did. ""And we have to have this conversation. ""Because there's so many people who have this perception, a wrong perception, of black people, Chinese people, based on what they have been wrongly told about them. ""It's understandable why he thought the way he did, because it's what the world has wrongly shown him."" He added that Neeson ""deserved a medal"" for admitting he was wrong so soon after the event. This video can not be played Playwright and author Bonnie Greer says Neesonâs race comments were a âsilly, stupid thing to doâ Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said Neeson's comments were ""completely inappropriate and offensive"" and to make them as he promoted a film was ""distasteful"". He told the BBC News Channel he was worried some of the reaction to the remarks ""seem to be absolving"" the actor and it ""should be about how deeply-seated these ideas still are"". Playwright and author Bonnie Greer said Neeson had ""probably put paid to his career"". She said: ""We are in an age where people are very sensitive and the fact that he doesn't understand what he's doing or what he's done is actually almost scarier than what he said.""

He said he walked the streets with a weapon for a week years ago, hoping to take out his anger after someone close to him was raped by a black man.

I'll tell you a story. This is true."" Neeson said the alleged rape took place a long time ago and he found out about it when he came back from a trip abroad. The actor went on to use racially offensive language about the attacker. He said: ""She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way. ""But my immediate reaction was... I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person. ""I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I'd be approached by somebody - I'm ashamed to say that - and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [uses air quotes with fingers] 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know?

Inan accompanying article in The Independent,external, columnist Kuba Shand-Baptiste wrote: ""What immediately struck me when reading about his revelation was how deeply the white supremacist trope of the 'black brute' versus the 'helpless woman' appears to have permeated society.""

""I knew a couple of guys that died on hunger strike, and I had acquaintances who were very caught up in the Troubles, and I understand that need for revenge, but it just leads to more revenge, to more killing and more killing, and Northern Ireland's proof of that.

"This video can not be played Willow Sims says her mental health - and family - are suffering as she tries to resolve the issue The lawyer overseeing a compensation scheme for victims ofthe Windrush scandalhas asked for ""urgent clarification"" after a woman was wrongly refused Home Office help. Willow Sims, who came to the UK aged four, has found herself in debt and facing eviction and deportation after losing her right to work. Proof of her indefinite leave to remain was lost when she entered foster care. The Home Office now says it is helping Ms Sims resolve her case. ""I feel like I don't exist,"" she said. ""My whole life has fallen apart."" Ms Sims moved to the UK from the US with her mother and has lived in the UK for more than 35 years. Willow Sims (left) lost her right to work in the UK, despite having lived in the country since she was four She was put in foster care as a teenager after her mother died, and it was around this time that much of her documentation was lost - including family photos and her original passport declaring she has indefinite leave to remain. Who are the Windrush generation? What should Windrush generation do now? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Last April she was subjected to a routine DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check by her employers, Lewisham Council. She holds a US passport from her time in care stating she was granted leave to remain in a previous passport, and the BBC has seen documents in her care files which prove she has been known to her local authority since at least the age of seven. Nevertheless, the council said this was not enough evidence. ""They accused me and my mum of being illegal immigrants and said I'd forged my passport,"" she said. ""I was a child and feel like I've been put on trial for something I couldn't control."" Ms Sims lost her right to work, access to healthcare and benefits. She is now thousands of pounds in debt and relying on food banks, despite 20 years' experience in social care and as a primary school teaching assistant. The Windrush taskforce was set up last April to help thousands of people who were wrongly targeted by the Home Office's ""hostile environment"" strategy for illegal immigration. People of any nationality who settled in the UK before 31 December 1988 can apply to the Windrush taskforce for help securing proof of their immigration status. Willow was placed in foster care following the death of her mother Ms Sims had contacted the Home Office four times: by the Windrush helpline, through a subject access request for documentation, and multiple times through her MP. Then, in December, she wrote a handwritten letter to the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, asking to meet a staff member to explain her case for British Citizenship. But until now, Ms Sims has never had a reply or received any direct communication from the Home Office. Ellie Reeves, the Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, told the BBC she was ""concerned"" to learn Ms Sims was eligible for the Windrush Scheme because, in correspondence, the Home Office had failed to notify her that Ms Sims was entitled to help. And when Ms Sims rang the helpline she was given the wrong advice. ""They told me that I wasn't eligible because I'm not from a Commonwealth country and don't have any ties to the Caribbean,"" she explained. After the BBC approached the Home Office, it confirmed Ms Sims was, in fact, eligible for help, but it's still not known why she was given the wrong advice in the first place. ""The taskforce are in contact with Ms Sims to help her resolve her case,"" a spokesperson said. ""She has been issued with an application form and referred to the Vulnerable Persons Team for additional help and support."" Ms Sims says she believes ""the problem is the name 'Windrush'"", adding: ""It makes you think of a boat, of a certain time, of a certain type of people, and no-one else."" HMT Empire Windrush brought the first West Indies immigrants to Britain in 1948 Martin Forde QC, who was appointed by the Home Office to oversee the Windrush compensation scheme, said officials needed further training to prevent mistakes like this happening again. ""This scheme is not just for Commonwealth citizens,"" he said. ""I'm concerned to know people are being turned away because of confusion about Home Office guidelines."" While Ms Sims no longer faces deportation, she is waiting for her final eviction letter and has been threatened with imprisonment for being unable to pay her council tax. ""I'm sad, I can't afford to eat, can't sleep, can't afford gas and it's not just me - it's affecting my kids. ""My daughter's got exams coming up and she's having to worry about me because she can see the decline in my mental health as the days turn into weeks and the weeks turn into months and now the months almost a year, and I can't do it any more."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Lewisham Council said Ms Sims' school could not legally continue to employ her following the DBS check because she was unable to present the evidence required. ""Since then, the Home Office has changed its arrangements following the Windrush scandal,"" it said. ""If in the light of this, the Home Office has now established that Ms Sims does have the right to work in the UK, we would be very happy to discuss her employment situation and opportunities for re-employment."" The Home Office says 186 people were formally refused help from the Windrush scheme last year, but has confirmed Ms Sims is not included in these figures. Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary following the Windrush scandal People of any nationality who settled in the UK before 31 December 1988 and have lived here continuously since People from Commonwealth countries who settled in the UK before 1 January 1973 and have lived here continuously since their arrival, or have the right of abode People from Commonwealth countries who settled in the UK before 1 January 1973, and their settlement status lapsed because they left the UK for more than 2 years, but are now lawfully in the UK and have strong ties with the UK Children of people from Commonwealth countries who were born in the UK, or arrived before they were 18 years old, and have lived here continuously since their arrival, and their parent was settled before 1 January 1973 or has the Right of Abode, or is now a British citizen What should Windrush generation do now?

"This video can not be played ""Teach kids the realities of knife crime."" The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has criticised a new scheme by the government to tackle knife crime. The Home Secretary announced plans for Knife Crime Prevention Orders last week, targeting suspects aged 12 and over -even if they don't have a blade. But Baroness Lawrence said there were better ways to deal with knife crime than ""criminalising"" children. The Home Office said the scheme would prevent young people from routinely carrying a knife. Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack in south-east London in 1993, aged 18. Labour peer Baroness Lawrence was speaking to the Home Affairs Select Committee ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Macpherson report, which looked into how the case was handled by the police. It concluded that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the force and made 72 recommendations for the police to follow. Social media ban for knife crime suspects Violent crime in England and Wales up 19% Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Baroness Lawrence, who has campaigned for police reforms since the murder of her son, told the committee: ""What is really worrying now is [what] the home secretary has announced about 12-year-olds carrying knives, so these kids are going to have a criminal record from the age of 12 and are going to be locked up. ""You are going to start criminalising [them] at the age of 12. ""Now I am sure there are other ways of dealing with that."" She called on the government to start going into schools to educate all children on what could happen if they carry knives. ""Kids who have been to prison or youth offenders... come out with a completely different way of dealing. Get those kids in to talk to them,"" said Baroness Lawrence. ""The older generation doesn't actually reach them, so you need the peer to go in and speak to those kids and let them know what the reality is."" This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the Asbo-style orders would give police more powers to prevent knife crime Baroness Lawrence said young black people also needed to be shown role models, rather than just negative ways in which their lives could turn out. ""Society has put a label on them that they are always up to no good, that they don't achieve anything, but that is not the case,"" she said. ""[They don't] see how many young people have gone off to university. It is always negative. They believe, 'I can't do any better'. ""They never see the positive side, we need to be able to do that more."" Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death as he waited at a bus stop Speaking later to the committee, the chairwoman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association highlighted that those role models may not be there in the police force, claiming diversity had ""gone backwards"". Det Sgt Janet Hills said there had been great strides in recruiting women into the police - with forces reaching a ""tipping point for cultural change"" - but that a ""gap has developed"" with a lack of policewomen from African, Asian or Caribbean backgrounds. ""When you look at the success of African, Caribbean and Asian heritage women within [recruitment], we are nowhere to be seen,"" she said. ""We have become invisible to the organisation, so you can have police organisations up and down the country that do not have any black females in them. ""If you turned that on its head and said we have constabularies without any women in them there would be a public outcry. ""But because we have become invisible to the organisation, that is how we are being missed. We are not being progressed and we are not being targeted around representing our communities within the police services."" Baroness Lawrence said it was key for the force, and other institutions, to represent the public they serve. ""I was trying to find out about progression of officers... and when you look at the top table, how many people of colour do you see there? Not many."" She added: ""You need good leadership andâ¦ you don't have leadership that represents community."" A Home Office spokesperson said the prevention orders would stop vulnerable young people from routinely carrying a knife and becoming involved in knife crime. The aim is preventative, and would not result in a criminal record. They said it was a core part of the Serious Violence Strategy - to address the root causes of violence by working with a range of agencies to focus on early intervention alongside strong law enforcement. Nearly Â£18m would be provided over the next two years through the Early Intervention Youth Fund to help Police and Crime Commissioners and Community Safety Partnerships, they said.

"Keegan, Tilly Rose, Olly and Riley, seen here in a photo taken from social media, died in the blaze in the early hours of Tuesday Four children have died in a house fire which also left a toddler and two adults - who leapt to safety from a first-floor window - injured Neighbours reported hearing screams as the blaze, in the Highfields area of Stafford, took hold overnight. The children killed in the fire were aged between three and eight, Staffordshire Police said. Both adults, along with the toddler, are in hospital, but their injuries are not life-threatening. The force named the four children, who have not been formally identified, as Riley Holt, eight, Keegan Unitt, six, Tilly Rose Unitt, four, and Olly Unitt, three. Their two-year-old brother Jack survived, along with mother Natalie Unitt, 24 and her partner Chris Moulton, 28. Neighbours 'distraught' over fatal house fire Part of the roof collapsed, windows were shattered and rooms left blackened by the blaze after the fire broke out on Sycamore Lane at about 02:40 GMT. Neighbour Wendy Pickering said she heard ""screaming"" in the middle of the night, while her husband Bryan said he was alerted to the fire by his dog barking during the night. This video can not be played Neighbour's tears for children killed in Stafford fire Firefighters confirmed that a man, woman and young child had escaped from a first-floor window before emergency services arrives. The cause of the blaze is not yet known. Flowers and soft toys have been left at the scene, while tributes have been paid to the four children who died by those who knew them Nicola Glover, head teacher of Castlechurch Primary School, which Riley, Tilly and Olly attended, said the school was ""absolutely devastated"". She described Riley as a ""confident, excitable"" and articulate boy ""who was always keen to ask lots of questions. A handwritten note attached to flowers was left at the scene from the children's grandparents Tilly, meanwhile ""was a happy little girl who loved coming to nursery"" and was ""a friendly and caring child who loved to read stories, dress up and paint"", Ms Glover said. She said Olly was ""a happy, loving boy who loved cuddles. He was always happy to come to nursery and loved to be in the role play area with the dolls"". Kim Ellis, head teacher at Marshlands School, where Keegan was a pupil, said he was ""full of fun and mischief"". ""He loved school and everyone who worked with him loved him. It is very hard to accept what has happened."" The fire ripped through the house destroying parts of the roof Ch Insp John Owen, of Staffordshire Police, described the blaze as ""absolutely heartbreaking"". ""Our firefighters were faced with very difficult conditions inside the property due to the severity of the fire,"" he said. Nathan Hudson, assistant chief officer of West Midlands Ambulance, added: ""This was an immensely difficult incident for all three (emergency) services to respond to. ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends and four children at this time."" This video can not be played Stafford house fire: Fire service to support community Matthew Ellis, Staffordshire Commissioner for Police Fire and Crime, paid tribute to emergency services for working in ""tragic and difficult circumstances in the middle of the night"". ""For something like this to happen it's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to imagine just how professional and how dedicated these people are, but they are all human beings."" County councillor for Stafford West, Carolyn Trowbridge, said local people had already begun to collect items and money to help the family. Speaking near the scene, she said: ""This is a great community. We will all pull together and we will try to help this family as much as we possibly can."" She said the emergency services had ""worked tirelessly"", adding: ""It must have been horrendous for them."" There was a special service at Castle Church in Stafford at 19:00 GMT. The Rev Philip Sowerbutts said: ""It will take this community a long time to get over such devastation. ""We as a church family along with all the other agencies have got to be here and stand together."" The nearby Signpost Centre on Auden Way has become one of many collection points for people looking to make donations to the family. Ken Down, who runs the centre, said: ""Lots of people who knew the family were in the cafe this morning talking about it. There is lots of sadness.

"Mourinho left his job as Manchester United manager in December Ex-Manchester United boss JosÃ© Mourinho has agreed a prison term in Spain for tax fraud but will not go to jail. A one-year prison sentence will instead be exchanged for a fine of â¬182,500 (Â£160,160). That will be added to a separate fine of â¬2m. Spain rarely enforces sentences of less than two years for non-violent or first-time offenders. He was accused of owing â¬3.3m to Spanish tax authorities from his time managing Real Madrid in 2011-2012. Prosecutors said he had created offshore companies to manage his image rights and hide the earnings from tax officials. Image rights cover the use of a person's likeness, voice, signature and mannerisms - and can be very lucrative for footballers and managers. Mr Mourinho's move to Manchester United in 2016 was even delayed after it emerged his previous teamChelsea owned the trademark to his name. Spanish prosecutors said that Mr Mourinho, a Portuguese national, had set up multiple business entities in the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere to manage his image rights. They argued that was designed to obscure his financial gain from such deals - and he left it undeclared in his tax statements after he moved to Spain. He is the latest high-profile football personality to strike a deal with Spanish authorities, which are pursuing a crackdown on tax evasion or fraud by the country's many resident star players. Mourinho reacts during the Manchester-Fulham match in December, weeks before leaving the manager's job In January,Cristiano Ronaldo accepted a fine of â¬18.8m and a suspended 23-month jail sentence, in a case which was also centred around tax owed on image rights. He was playing for Real Madrid at the time of the offence between 2010 and 2014 - the same team Mr Mourinho was managing at the time of his own tax violation. Unlike the Ronaldo case, Spanish media were not told about Tuesday's hearing, so there was no crowd to meet the former Manchester United manager, who lost his job in December. Ronaldo fined â¬18.8m over tax evasion Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? How to hide your cash Another former Real Madrid star, Xabi Alonso, is also facing charges over alleged tax fraud amounting to about â¬2m, though he denies any wrongdoing. Marcelo Vieira, who still plays for the club, accepted a four-month suspended jail sentence last September over his use of foreign firms to handle almost half a million euros in earnings. Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Neymar have also found themselves embroiled in legal battles with the Spanish tax authorities. As in many of the cases, Mr Mourinho's deal which spared him from prison had been agreed in advance with tax officials. Mr Mourinho's representatives have declined to comment.

"This video can not be played Molly Russell's father told the BBC he believed Instagram had 'helped kill my daughter' Harmful suicide and self-harm content online ""has the effect of grooming people to take their own lives"", the suicide prevention minister has said. Jackie Doyle-Price has told the BBC that social media companies must ""step up"" to protect vulnerable users. It comes after links were made between thesuicide of teenager Molly Russelland her exposure to harmful content. The government is to roll out new laws to remove illegal content and protect vulnerable people later this year. Digital Minister Margot James promised to crack down on many of the social media platforms that have ""fallen short"" in their response to online bullying, abuse and misinformation. In a speech at a conference for Safer Internet Day, Ms James said: ""We will soon be publishing an Online Harms White Paper which will set out clear expectations for companies to help keep their users, particularly children, safe online. ""We will introduce laws that force social media platforms to remove illegal content, and to prioritise the protection of users beyond their commercial interests."" Meanwhile Ms Doyle-Price was due to meet Facebook on Tuesday to discuss what action it is taking. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We want social media not really to be doing this through the stick of the law, we want them to do it to look after their users."" She said she hoped senior staff at Facebook, which also owns Instagram, would act - ideally using algorithms to protect people rather than ""bombard"" them with advertising. Ms Doyle-Price said: ""Sometimes they do [act], but more often they don't"". Instagram 'helped kill my daughter' Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Adults 'can't keep up with technology' Addressing the National Suicide Prevention Alliance Conference on Tuesday, she said: ""If companies cannot behave responsibly and protect their users, we will legislate. ""They shouldn't wait for government to tell them what to do. It says a lot about the values of companies if they do not take action voluntarily."" Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""We could use fines, we could make social media companies much more responsible and apply the full force of the law to them if we feel they are being negligent in their duty of care to their users."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Home Office are due to publish a white paper on the government's approach to online safety later this year. A family photo of Molly, taken in 2009 Ms Doyle-Price said the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 aged 14, had done much to highlight the issue. ""I am full of admiration for Molly's father for being so brave and frank,"" she said. Molly's father, Ian Russell, told the BBC he believed Instagram had ""helped kill my daughter"". When her family looked at her Instagram account after her death, they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Ms Doyle-Price said that after Mr Russell spoke out, ""so many other parents have spoken out...it has really focused people's minds"". She added: ""The really shocking thing is that he had absolutely no idea that his daughter was looking at these things online."" The boss of Instagram,Adam Mosseri, is due to meet the health secretarythis week over the platform's handling of content promoting self-harm and suicide. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said Molly's case had left him ""deeply moved"" and he accepted the site had work to do. He wrote: ""We rely heavily on our community to report this content, and remove it as soon as it's found. ""The bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they're seen by other people."" This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram In a separate case, Libby, 16, and her father Ian have shared their story after hearing of Molly's death. At the age of 12, Libby, became ""hooked"" on posting and viewing self-harm images on Instagram - including pictures of cutting, burning and overdosing. Her father said his family reported such images to Instagram, but the social media company did nothing.

"Mourinho left his job as Manchester United manager in December Ex-Manchester United boss JosÃ© Mourinho has agreed a prison term in Spain for tax fraud but will not go to jail. A one-year prison sentence will instead be exchanged for a fine of â¬182,500 (Â£160,160). That will be added to a separate fine of â¬2m. Spain rarely enforces sentences of less than two years for non-violent or first-time offenders. He was accused of owing â¬3.3m to Spanish tax authorities from his time managing Real Madrid in 2011-2012. Prosecutors said he had created offshore companies to manage his image rights and hide the earnings from tax officials. Image rights cover the use of a person's likeness, voice, signature and mannerisms - and can be very lucrative for footballers and managers. Mr Mourinho's move to Manchester United in 2016 was even delayed after it emerged his previous teamChelsea owned the trademark to his name. Spanish prosecutors said that Mr Mourinho, a Portuguese national, had set up multiple business entities in the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere to manage his image rights. They argued that was designed to obscure his financial gain from such deals - and he left it undeclared in his tax statements after he moved to Spain. He is the latest high-profile football personality to strike a deal with Spanish authorities, which are pursuing a crackdown on tax evasion or fraud by the country's many resident star players.

"Daniel Williams was last seen leaving a bar at about 01:00 GMT on Thursday A body has been found in a lake in the search for a missing 19-year-old student, police said. Daniel Williams, from Sutton in London, has been missing since Thursday after failing to return home after a night out at the University of Reading. Police searching for him discovered the body in Whiteknights Lake near the university's campus. Thames Valley Police said the death was being treated as unexplained and was not believed to be suspicious. No formal identification has taken place, the force said, but Mr Williams' family has been informed. In response to the ""very sad"" news, the university said activities on campus would continue as normal and support would be available to students and staff. Allow Twitter content?

A major search, aided by search and rescue volunteers and the National Police Air Service, was launched over the weekend for second-year computer science student Mr Williams. Police said they had checked a lake and surrounding countryside on Monday. Search crews were seen searching Whiteknights Lake in a small boat until about 13:00 GMT on Monday. Student's disappearance 'out of character' Vigil held for missing university student Lead investigator, Supt Jim Weems, said recent snow had ""not hampered"" the search, but the night Mr Williams disappeared was ""one of the coldest"" of the year. A vigil was hosted on Monday in the Whiteknights campus bar, 3sixty, where Mr Williams was last seen. Police water search teams have spent two days in the lake Joe Campbell, BBC South The forensic team arrived just before 11:00 GMT and there were lots of police on the scene. A small group - including plain clothes officers and forensic specialists - gathered on the bank of the lake and were deep in conversation. The water search team has packed their equipment away, their job is done. Police have closed the nearby footpath, but the university campus remains open. Speaking before the body was found, the university's Anglican Chaplain Mark Laynesmith told the BBC students were in ""shock"". Acting vice-chancellor Prof Robert Van de Noort said support was being offered to Mr Williams' housemates and friends. Mr Williams' family described him as ""a happy, normal 19-year-old enjoying university life"" and said they had ""no concern at all"" about him before he went missing.

"Terry has given up his job in London and moved to Monmouth to look after his 92-year-old father More than 600 people a day leave their jobs because of the demands of being a carer, says research from a charity. The pressures of looking after an elderly, ill or disabled relative have made almost half a million people quit their jobs in the UK in the past two years, says Carers UK. The report calls for more flexibility in the workplace for carers. The charity's head, Helen Walker, says that 15% of the working population is ""now working and caring"". The report estimates that almost five million people are trying to balance looking after relatives with working - up from about three million in 2011. An ageing population has pushed this increase - but the report says not enough employers are offering flexibility over working hours or taking leave. Carers UK is calling for employment rights to formally recognise the needs of carers, such as providing five to 10 days per year of paid leave. Such carers in work are typically aged over 45 and the report says that their caring responsibilities ""often go unnoticed"". Among those giving up their job is Terry, who has left his role as a duty hospital manager in London to move to Monmouth to look after his father. The 92-year-old was living alone after Terry's mother died and he had begun to ""struggle with everyday tasks"". For Terry, it has meant going from a well paid job to relying on a carer's allowance and accepting that he now ""doesn't have a penny spare"". The report follows a warning from the Office for National Statistics of growing numbers of people who not only have to look after an elderly relative but are also caring for their children. There are 1.3 million of these mid-life ""sandwich carers"", says the ONS, with many feeling ignored and undervalued. More than a quarter of such carers are suffering from depression or stress,external, says the ONS. Carers UK says there is a ""real social and economic imperative"" for workplaces to be made ""carer friendly"". ""Better workplace support for people juggling paid work with caring for a loved one is becoming an increasingly important issue,"" said Ms Walker.

"This video can not be played Molly Russell's father told the BBC he believed Instagram had 'helped kill my daughter' Harmful suicide and self-harm content online ""has the effect of grooming people to take their own lives"", the suicide prevention minister has said. Jackie Doyle-Price has told the BBC that social media companies must ""step up"" to protect vulnerable users. It comes after links were made between thesuicide of teenager Molly Russelland her exposure to harmful content. The government is to roll out new laws to remove illegal content and protect vulnerable people later this year. Digital Minister Margot James promised to crack down on many of the social media platforms that have ""fallen short"" in their response to online bullying, abuse and misinformation. In a speech at a conference for Safer Internet Day, Ms James said: ""We will soon be publishing an Online Harms White Paper which will set out clear expectations for companies to help keep their users, particularly children, safe online. ""We will introduce laws that force social media platforms to remove illegal content, and to prioritise the protection of users beyond their commercial interests."" Meanwhile Ms Doyle-Price was due to meet Facebook on Tuesday to discuss what action it is taking. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We want social media not really to be doing this through the stick of the law, we want them to do it to look after their users."" She said she hoped senior staff at Facebook, which also owns Instagram, would act - ideally using algorithms to protect people rather than ""bombard"" them with advertising. Ms Doyle-Price said: ""Sometimes they do [act], but more often they don't"". Instagram 'helped kill my daughter' Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Adults 'can't keep up with technology' Addressing the National Suicide Prevention Alliance Conference on Tuesday, she said: ""If companies cannot behave responsibly and protect their users, we will legislate. ""They shouldn't wait for government to tell them what to do. It says a lot about the values of companies if they do not take action voluntarily."" Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""We could use fines, we could make social media companies much more responsible and apply the full force of the law to them if we feel they are being negligent in their duty of care to their users."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Home Office are due to publish a white paper on the government's approach to online safety later this year. A family photo of Molly, taken in 2009 Ms Doyle-Price said the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 aged 14, had done much to highlight the issue. ""I am full of admiration for Molly's father for being so brave and frank,"" she said. Molly's father, Ian Russell, told the BBC he believed Instagram had ""helped kill my daughter"". When her family looked at her Instagram account after her death, they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Ms Doyle-Price said that after Mr Russell spoke out, ""so many other parents have spoken out...it has really focused people's minds"". She added: ""The really shocking thing is that he had absolutely no idea that his daughter was looking at these things online."" The boss of Instagram,Adam Mosseri, is due to meet the health secretarythis week over the platform's handling of content promoting self-harm and suicide. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said Molly's case had left him ""deeply moved"" and he accepted the site had work to do. He wrote: ""We rely heavily on our community to report this content, and remove it as soon as it's found. ""The bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they're seen by other people."" This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram In a separate case, Libby, 16, and her father Ian have shared their story after hearing of Molly's death. At the age of 12, Libby, became ""hooked"" on posting and viewing self-harm images on Instagram - including pictures of cutting, burning and overdosing. Her father said his family reported such images to Instagram, but the social media company did nothing. Speaking to the BBC, Libby described how she was drawn in to an online community and recalled sharing pictures of her fresh cuts with 8,000 followers. Read more of her storyhere.

Mayo will lead the line-up on a new classical music station Whiley's addition to Drivetime came after Radio 2 was criticised for its lack of female presenters. Mayo said: ""There was genuine pressure from the top about improving the number of women in daytime"". The presenter added he was not told about the change in a face-to-face meeting with managers. Instead, he found out about the decision to introduce a female co-presenter in a phone call with his agent. Mayo then insisted his co-host should be Whiley, as the pair had been friends for years and had even gone on a family holiday together. He claimed managers never gave him a sense that the decision would be reversed if it didn't work, adding: ""They'd invested too much political capital in the change."" Mayo joined Radio 2 in January 2010 The resulting showmet with a huge backlash from listenersand ended after just a few months on air, when Mayo announced his departure from Radio 2. Mayo said he didn't see himself, or Whiley, as a victim, saying: ""I think victim's the wrong word. Jo and I worked very hard to make that show as good as it could be."" His exit camea few weeks after Chris Evans announced he was quittingthe station's breakfast show. Chris Evans returned to the Virgin Radio breakfast show in January Mayo revealed Evans offered him a job at Virgin Radio at the time, saying: ""He rang me and said, 'Do you want to work here?' I said, 'I'm already spoken for."" Mayo will soon be heard in a new show on digital classical music station Scala, which begins on 4 March. He continues to present a film review show with Mark Kermode on BBC Radio 5 Live. Sara Cox is the new host of Drivetime on Radio 2 Sara Cox now presentsBBC Radio 2's Drivetime show andZoe Ball has becomethe station's first female Breakfast show host. Whiley remains at Radio 2, presenting a weekday evening show. The changes at Radio 2 have created a more gender balanced presenting line-up. Of the new schedule, Mayo said: ""It's not the way I'd have designed it."" But he added: ""The overwhelming gratitude I have after 36 years eclipses the difficulties of the last months.""

"This video can not be played The fire was brought under control in the early hours of Tuesday morning Ten people including a baby have died in a fire at an eight-storey building in south-western Paris, officials say. More than 30 people - including six firefighters - were injured. One person is in a serious condition. Fifty people were evacuated by ladders from the blaze in the upmarket 16th arrondissement. Investigators believe the fire - one of the most deadly in the French capital in years - was possibly started deliberately. A woman detained earlier by police is no longer being questioned and, after undergoing medical and behavioural tests, has been admitted to the psychiatric infirmary of the Paris police, media reports quote the Paris prosecutor as saying. Earlier,French President Emmanuel Macron said the country ""had woken up to tragedy,external"", and praised the fire services for their courage. Rue Erlanger is a residential street close to the Parc des Princes football stadium and the Roland-Garros tennis venue. The fire started on the second floor and spread across the block - built in the 1970s, unlike many of the older, classic Parisian buildings nearby - shortly after 01:00 (00:00 GMT), forcing some residents to scramble on to nearby rooftops to escape the flames and smoke. This video can not be played A survivor describes how she ""jumped across balconies"" to escape An eyewitness at the scene told French television: ""The fire alarm went off at 00:30, a little after midnight, and smoke was everywhere already. I live on the eighth floor, the top floor, so I tried to pass from balcony to balcony to get away, And then we huddled up in a corner. Other people climbed up to where I was to escape the flames."" About 250 firefighters were deployed to the scene, not far from the Bois de Boulogne park, helping to rescue those trapped on the roofs. Pictures showed flames coming from the top floor windows and firefighters in breathing apparatus scaling ladders to reach residents. Rescue efforts were initially hampered by the fact that the apartments on fire were inside an inner courtyard with no vehicle access. ""When we arrived, we were faced with an apocalyptic situation. Lots of people were calling for help from the windows,"" a spokesman for the fire service said. Firefighters said the building's courtyard had acted as a funnel, helping the flames to spread from the lower to the upper floors. Six firefighters are among the injured,external, officials say. The fire is one of the deadliest Paris has seen in years The fire was brought under control after a five-hour operation. Surrounding buildings in the area have been evacuated as a precaution. Town hall officials have been tasked with finding alternative accommodation. On Tuesday afternoon, architects working for the Paris police assessed the building and said there was ""a serious and imminent danger to the occupants"", who are therefore barred from returning for now. An investigation has been opened into the criminal charge of causing death by arson. Several local residents said the fire had started after a dispute between neighbours in the block over loud music. It was not immediately known what had caused the fire ParisMayor Anne Hidalgo sent her condolences to the victims, and visited the site,externalon Tuesday morning, along with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Just a few weeks earlier,four people were killed after a huge blast at a bakeryin the centre of the city. Hugh Schofield, BBC News Paris This is a well-to-do apartment building in an affluent neighbourhood. Other recent, deadly fires in Paris have been in poor, overcrowded areas where safety norms have clearly being ignored. By mid-morning, the fire had been extinguished and normal life was resuming. Sounds of children playing came from a schoolyard next door. The building is on an inner courtyard, so from outside there was no sign at all of the anguish and the drama. Firefighters were widely praised for saving 50 people from the building But groups of people were milling about, residents from neighbouring buildings who had been told to leave their homes. They wanted to know when they could go back. The occasional witness arrived who saw it all: the screaming, the flames, the people on seventh-floor window ledges staring into the void. They said they wouldn't ever forget.

"HMV's flagship - and original - Oxford Street store in central London has closed Canadian firm Sunrise Records has emerged as the buyer of collapsed music chain HMV, beating competition including Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley. The firm will buy 100 stores out of administration, securing 1,487 jobs. But 27 stores will close, resulting in 455 redundancies. Sunrise Records chief executive Doug Putman said he was ""delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK."" No price was given. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back on the changing fortunes of the high street music retailer The administrators KPMG announced that the company's flagship Oxford Street store in London, its first shop when it opened in 1921, is among the 27 outlets set to close. Ayr Bath Bluewater, Kent Bristol, Cribbs Causeway Chichester Exeter, Princesshay Fopp, Bristol Fopp, Glasgow Byres Fopp, Manchester Fopp, Oxford Glasgow, Braehead Guernsey Hereford Trafford, Manchester Merry Hill, Dudley Oxford Street, central London Queensgate, Peterborough Plymouth, Drake Circus Reading Meadowhall, Sheffield Southport Thurrock Tunbridge Wells Uxbridge Watford Westfield Shepherds Bush Wimbledon Canadian entrepreneur Mr Putman, 34, bought the retail chain Sunrise Records in 2014. He previously bought HMV's Canadian business in 2017, expanding his small chain into a national operation with 80 outlets. Can anyone make HMV successful? HMV: The rise and fall of a music icon HMV: Did streaming cause retailer to fail? Not all of the HMV stores will reopen Mr Putman is also President of Everest Toys, the largest toys and games distribution company in North America. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that HMV was a ""fantastic, heritage brand"". He also said the chain would be looking to stock more vinyl records, in response to customer demand. First successful business venture - selling fresh local produce - started aged 16. Bought Canada's Sunrise Records in 2014 - and expanded it. Took over HMV's Canadian locations after it went into administration. Mr Putman also owns a restaurant called The Granite in Bancroft, Ontario, and Makin Waves Marine, a boat dealer. His family also run Everest Toys, one of the largest toy wholesalers in North America. This video can not be played His deal will ultimately save 1,600 jobs, he tells the Today programme ""I feel really lucky to be able to say we [will] continue to call it HMV,"" he told the programme. There had been speculation that the shops might be rebranded as Sunrise Records stores after Mr Putman's rebranding of HMV's Canadian business. ""It is very clear that the customer wants more selection on vinyl, more depth of catalogue,"" he said. ""There's no doubt that online is a big part of overall retail sales. But people like to come into a store, have an experience, talk with someone who understands music, loves music, loves video and entertainment. If you think online is the only future I don't think that is the case."" He added: ""There is so much you get from coming into a store that you can't get online."" Robert Plummer, business reporter News of a successful rescue bid for troubled HMV couldn't come soon enough for staff and customers alike, although some outlets will unfortunately be closing. After the store chain suffered its second collapse in December, it has faced weeks of uncertainty, with no new supplies reaching its branches. That didn't matter so much in January, traditionally a lean time for music releases. But now February has begun, bands are putting out new albums again and their absence from HMV's shelves was starting to look embarrassing. On Monday, HMV's flagship Oxford Street store was unable to provide copies of the latest CDs by the Specials, Busted and Ian Brown, which had been issued at the end of last week. That means those albums are hard to find on the High Street right now, since HMV sells nearly a third of the UK's physical music product. Impulse buyers unable to walk out with those releases may well represent sales that are lost to the music industry forever - providing evidence of why record companies need HMV to survive. According to Canadian broadcaster CBC last year, his aim is also to tap into local tastes in music and store autonomy is important, he said. ""I think you lose something when everything's exactly the same,"" Mr Putman told CBC. ""Essentially every store has a different assortment. If metal is really big in that area, they can stock more of that."" HMV collapsed in December, its second administration in six years. Until now, Mr Ashley had been the likely favourite to take over the music retailer. As the owner of more than 60% of Sports Direct, he has bought retailers including the House of Fraser department store chain and Evans Cycles. His company also owns stakes in French Connection and Debenhams. A woman at the first listening booths in HMV in the 1930s HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges for the latest collapse. These include business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies. HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. However, the music industry expects physical entertainment sales to shrink by another 17% this year. Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator said: ""We are pleased to confirm this sale which, after a complex process, secures the continued trading of the majority of the business. ""Our immediate concern is now to support those employees that have unfortunately been made redundant."" One significant issue for physical retailers is rising rental and business rates costs, particularly at high-profile sites such as London's Oxford Street. According to real estate adviser, Altus Group, HMV saw its business rates bill for its flagship store on Oxford Street rise to Â£1,308,150 this financial year, almost double the amount it was paying before the controversial revaluation came into effect in April 2017. The store's rateable value is its estimated annual rent paid on 1st April 2015, and rose by Â£1.04 million to Â£2.55 million under the 2017 revaluation. A brief history of HMV.

"Ocado has reported widening losses in the year ending 2 December 2018. The online food retailer recorded a pre-tax loss of Â£44.4m, compared with Â£9.8m in the previous 12 months. However, its sales rose by 12.3% to Â£1.59bn and chief executive Tim Steiner said: ""We now have in place a platform for significant and sustainable long-term value creation."" Last week, Ocado's shares rose by as much as 6.7%after a suggestion it may do a deal with Marks and Spencer. Mr Steiner refused to confirm or deny the story, saying the company never commented on speculation linking it with rumoured deals. However, he did say: ""We are constantly talking to different retailers around the world."" Ocado currently has a deal with southern England-focused Waitrose, which is due to come to an end in September 2020. And Mr Steiner added: ""Under the current arrangement we have with Waitrose, we wouldn't be able to add the own labels of another substantial UK grocery retailer into the current Ocado offering."" The company's losses grew as a result of investment costs, including development of its new warehouses and IT systems, and an accounting charge, while its earnings fell by 20.7% to Â£59.5m. It attracted 11.8% more active customers, taking its total to 721,000, with total order volumes increasing by 12.1% to an average of 296,000 per week. The value of each basket shrunk slightly, however, to Â£106.85 from Â£107.28. Mr Steiner said that Ocado was ""the leading pure-play digital grocer in the UK, a world-leading provider of end-to-end e-commerce grocery solutions"" and added, ""our transformation journey is well under way"". He added: ""Creating future value now will involve us continuing to scale the business, enhancing our platform, enabling our UK retail business to take advantage of all its opportunities for growth and innovating for the future."" In a statement, the company said it was confident of achieving retail revenue growth of between 10% and 15% this year, despite another expected drop in earnings. Mr Steiner said that Ocado was as prepared as it could be for the impact of Brexit. He explained that none of the food retailers could stockpile food because of lack of space and the fact that fresh stock would not last long. But he said they had started to get in extra supplies of ""mechanical spare parts that we need to keep our facilities running. We don't want to be in a situation where we can buy the food, but can't buy a component"". He added: ""This is an example of one of the mitigating things that we have done.""

"Keegan, Tilly Rose, Olly and Riley, seen here in a photo taken from social media, died in the blaze in the early hours of Tuesday Four children have died in a house fire which also left a toddler and two adults - who leapt to safety from a first-floor window - injured Neighbours reported hearing screams as the blaze, in the Highfields area of Stafford, took hold overnight. The children killed in the fire were aged between three and eight, Staffordshire Police said. Both adults, along with the toddler, are in hospital, but their injuries are not life-threatening. The force named the four children, who have not been formally identified, as Riley Holt, eight, Keegan Unitt, six, Tilly Rose Unitt, four, and Olly Unitt, three. Their two-year-old brother Jack survived, along with mother Natalie Unitt, 24 and her partner Chris Moulton, 28. Neighbours 'distraught' over fatal house fire Part of the roof collapsed, windows were shattered and rooms left blackened by the blaze after the fire broke out on Sycamore Lane at about 02:40 GMT. Neighbour Wendy Pickering said she heard ""screaming"" in the middle of the night, while her husband Bryan said he was alerted to the fire by his dog barking during the night. This video can not be played Neighbour's tears for children killed in Stafford fire Firefighters confirmed that a man, woman and young child had escaped from a first-floor window before emergency services arrives. The cause of the blaze is not yet known. Flowers and soft toys have been left at the scene, while tributes have been paid to the four children who died by those who knew them Nicola Glover, head teacher of Castlechurch Primary School, which Riley, Tilly and Olly attended, said the school was ""absolutely devastated"". She described Riley as a ""confident, excitable"" and articulate boy ""who was always keen to ask lots of questions. A handwritten note attached to flowers was left at the scene from the children's grandparents Tilly, meanwhile ""was a happy little girl who loved coming to nursery"" and was ""a friendly and caring child who loved to read stories, dress up and paint"", Ms Glover said. She said Olly was ""a happy, loving boy who loved cuddles. He was always happy to come to nursery and loved to be in the role play area with the dolls"". Kim Ellis, head teacher at Marshlands School, where Keegan was a pupil, said he was ""full of fun and mischief"". ""He loved school and everyone who worked with him loved him. It is very hard to accept what has happened."" The fire ripped through the house destroying parts of the roof Ch Insp John Owen, of Staffordshire Police, described the blaze as ""absolutely heartbreaking"". ""Our firefighters were faced with very difficult conditions inside the property due to the severity of the fire,"" he said. Nathan Hudson, assistant chief officer of West Midlands Ambulance, added: ""This was an immensely difficult incident for all three (emergency) services to respond to. ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends and four children at this time.""

""For something like this to happen it's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to imagine just how professional and how dedicated these people are, but they are all human beings."" County councillor for Stafford West, Carolyn Trowbridge, said local people had already begun to collect items and money to help the family. Speaking near the scene, she said: ""This is a great community. We will all pull together and we will try to help this family as much as we possibly can."" She said the emergency services had ""worked tirelessly"", adding: ""It must have been horrendous for them."" There was a special service at Castle Church in Stafford at 19:00 GMT. The Rev Philip Sowerbutts said: ""It will take this community a long time to get over such devastation. ""We as a church family along with all the other agencies have got to be here and stand together."" The nearby Signpost Centre on Auden Way has become one of many collection points for people looking to make donations to the family. Ken Down, who runs the centre, said: ""Lots of people who knew the family were in the cafe this morning talking about it. There is lots of sadness. ""We are open five days a week for anyone who is having any issues. If they are feeling really upset about it they can come here and talk to us."" Ken Down runs the nearby Signpost Centre A donation page set up to help the family ""rebuild their lives"" has amassed more than Â£12,000 since it was launched. Its founder, Stephen Glover, whose daughter attended the same school as Riley Holt, said he was ""delighted"" at the generosity of people not only from Stafford but all over the country. Housing association Stafford and Rural Homes, which owns the property, said it was assisting the police and fire service with investigations.

"Councils say a more sustainable funding model is needed to ensure services continue The latest financial pot for councils in England will ""pave the way for a more confident, self-sufficient and reinvigorated local government,"" the communities secretary has said. James Brokenshire claimed local authorities would have an extra Â£1.3bn in the next financial year. But this is their estimated ""spending power"", not the guaranteed government grant, which will fall by around Â£1bn. The Local Government Association (LGA) has complained of a Â£3bn funding gap. It said ""huge uncertainty"" remained over the provision of services. MPs voted on Tuesday evening to adopt the plans. Are these councils defying the cuts? Council spending cuts, in seven charts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Council makes Â£82m budget cuts Council approves budget cuts of Â£5m The ""core spending power"" of councils will rise by Â£1.3bn or 2.8% to Â£46.4bn - which includes money raised if councils increase their tax by the maximum 3% allowed and collect strong amounts from rents and business rates. However, the central grant they get from government will drop by around Â£1bn on the current financial year. BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan said council budgets would shrink by almost 6%, meaning more services would have to be cut. Opening the debate, Mr Brokenshire said he had listened to councils who wanted more control of the money they raised, and had plans to allow more authorities to keep the business rates they collected. He also promised a review of the formula used to work out how money is split between areas, saying the current one was ""far too complicated and frankly out of date"". He said the moves would ""reboot our system"" of local government. ""Strong, vibrant resilient communities are more than ever key to unlocking a brighter future for our country,"" said the minister. ""I hold these dedicated public servants in the highest regard and have faith in them to rise to the challenges that lie ahead to see their people and places flourish with no-one left behind."" Labour's communities spokesman Andrew Gwynne said all councils had been ""hung out to dry"" by the government over the last nine years and the figure for core spending power was ""smoke and mirrors"". He added: ""There is no new new money, no new ideas, no recognition of the dire situation facing councils."" The independentInstitute for Fiscal Studies calculates that poorer council areas,externalwill lose more money that richer authorities. LGA chairman Lord Porter said: ""The money councils have to provide local services is running out fast and there is huge uncertainty about how they will pay for them into the next decade and beyond.""

"Kyle Remzi, a computer science student at Essex University, died aged 20 after an overdose in 2017 At least 204 deaths have been linked to the misuse of anxiety drug Xanax in the UK since 2015, figures seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme reveal. Of these, there were 126 fatalities in Scotland between 2015 and 2017. Counterfeit Xanax bars with a street value of more than Â£1m have been seized at UK ports and airports since 2016. Border Force said its officers were ""at the forefront of the fight to keep illegal drugs out of the country"". ""We are taking a smarter approach to restricting the supply of drugs and are adapting our approach to reflect changes in criminal activity,"" it added. Pfizer, the company that developed Xanax as a prescription drug, said it was ""alarmed by the rise"" of counterfeit versions and that it ""continued to work side-by-side with all law enforcement"". It added that Xanax was ""subject to strict regulations"" and ""should only be used as prescribed by and under the supervision of a qualified healthcare practitioner"". Xanax, also known by the name alprazolam, is widely prescribed in the US to treat anxiety and panic attacks, and can be obtained on private prescription in the UK - though not through the NHS. Counterfeit versions of the class C drug are often bought via the dark web, and mixed with other substances, which makes it extra dangerous. There were 30 deaths reported in England and Wales between 2015 and 2017, figures provided by the Office for National Statistics show. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has found evidence of at least five further deaths from the misuse of Xanax in 2018. Between 2015 and 2017 - 43 people have died in Northern Ireland having misused Xanax with other drugs. Sarah Stewart says her son's death has left the family ""in pieces"" Sarah Stewart's son Kyle Remzi, a computer science student at Essex University, died aged 20 after an overdose in 2017. A post-mortem examination found illegally-obtained, counterfeit Xanax to be the cause of his death. There were also traces of MDMA and alcohol in his blood. ""I kept begging him to listen. Xanax was the problem with him,"" she said, breaking into tears. ""He was addicted and I tried so hard. ""When he died, so did the family. We're all in pieces. ""He just thought it was a party thing. He was educated, loved by everyone - all the love in the world didn't save him."" In 2018, some 340,000 counterfeit Xanax bars were seized at UK ports and airports, figures from Border Force figures and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) show. The MHRA's head of enforcement, Alastair Jeffrey, said the key was raising awareness among the public and giving people ""the knowledge that buying medicines outside the regulated supply chain is a really dangerous thing to do"". In Belfast, rough sleeper Andy, 22 - whose surname we are not using - said he was dependent on the drug and took up to 20 illegally-obtained pills a day. When the Victoria Derbyshire programme met him, he said he had been on a life-support machine two days earlier, because of the effects of Xanax. ""My heart stopped. They cut my clothes off. They had to put tubes down me and I was on a life-support machine,"" he said. ""I woke up. Thankfully."" Andy fears he may not see the age of 25 He added that he was already back taking Xanax. Asked why, he answered: ""I don't know any better. ""I probably won't see 25 if I don't stop. I'll be lucky if I see 23."" Northern Ireland's police service (PSNI) said counterfeit Xanax was the third most-seized drug there, accounting for 25% of the 113 deaths involving drugs recorded in 2018. The PSNI's DCI David Henderson said it had ""more seizure incidents of [psychoactive drugs] benzo, which includes Xanax, than we do of heroin or ecstasy."" Some hospitals have been struggling to cope with overdoses involving the misuse of Xanax. NHS Grampian in Aberdeen issued a warning of the dangers in 2018, having recorded 29 deaths involving the drug the year before. The Scottish government said it was ""increasing awareness of the health-related dangers of misusing prescription drugsâ¦ and addressing the underlying factors"".

"A UN trade official has warned a US plan to raise tariffs on Chinese goods next month would have ""massive"" implications for the global economy. The US plans to increase tariffs on Chinese goods if the two sides fail to make progress on a trade deal by 1 March. The comments followed a report by a UN trade agency on the impact of the US-China trade war. It said Asian countries are likely to suffer most from protectionism. The US and China are locked in a damaging trade dispute that has seen both sides levy tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. In December, both countries agreed to hold off on new tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. The US and China have a deadline of 1 March to strike a deal, or the US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn (Â£152bn) worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. China hails 'progress' in US trade talks Will the US and China reach a trade deal? The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) has warned that there will be huge costs if the trade war escalates. ""The implications are going to be massive,"" Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Unctad's head of international trade, said at a news conference. ""The implications for the entire international trading system will be significantly negative."" Smaller and poorer countries would struggle to cope with the external shocks, she said. The higher cost of US-China trade would prompt companies to shift away from current east Asian supply chains. Unctad's report estimates that east Asian producers will be hit the hardest, with a projected $160bn contraction in the region's exports. But it warns the effects could be felt everywhere. ""There'll be currency wars and devaluation, stagflation leading to job losses and higher unemployment and more importantly, the possibility of a contagion effect, or what we call a reactionary effect, leading to a cascade of other trade distortionary measures,"" Ms Coke-Hamilton said. The higher cost of US-China trade would prompt companies to shift away from current east Asian supply chains, but report suggests it's unlikely that US firms would pick up that business. The study found that US firms will only pick up 6% of the $250bn in Chinese exports that are subject to US tariffs. Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite Of the approximately $85bn in US exports that are subject to China's tariffs, only about 5% will be taken up by Chinese firms, the UN research shows. The study found that European exports will grow by $70bn, while Japan, Canada and Mexico will see exports increase by more than $20bn each. Other countries that could benefit include Australia, Brazil, India, the Philippines and Vietnam, the report said.

"This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa A group of Latin American countries and Canada has urged the Venezuelan military to support opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. In a statement, 11 of the 14 members of the Lima Group called for a change of power without the use of force and the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid. Mr GuaidÃ³ has declared himself interim president and won support from major powers including the US. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says he is the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Mr Maduro, who has the backing of a number of countries including China and Russia, earlier warned that the country's deepening political crisis could spark civil war. The crisis in nine charts Where countries stand on Venezuela Why Maduro has the military's backing Country profile Mr Maduro was sworn in last month for a second term after disputed elections which many opposition leaders did not contest because they were in jail or boycotting them. In response, Mr GuaidÃ³, who is head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate. The group issued a 17-point declaration,,externalfollowing a meeting in the Canadian capital, Ottawa. The document says the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru ""reiterate their recognition and support for Juan GuaidÃ³"" as interim president of Venezuela. Rightful leader or usurper? Dictator or defender of socialism? The 11 group members also urged the world community ""to take measures to prevent the Maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, from having access to Venezuela's international assets and from doing business in oil, gold and other assets"". However, three members of the Lima Group - Guyana, Mexico and St Lucia - did not back the declaration. The Lima Group was set up in 2017 with the aim of helping to find a peaceful solution to the Venezuela crisis. Asked on Spanish television if the crisis in Venezuela could lead to civil war, Mr Maduro said on Monday that ""no-one could answer that question with certainty"". ""Everything depends on the level of madness and aggressiveness of the northern empire [the US] and its Western allies. ""We ask that nobody intervenes in our internal affairs... and we prepare ourselves to defend our country."" The US has said military invention remains an ""option"".,external This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? But in a speech on Monday, Mr GuaidÃ³ said: ""There is no possibility of a civil war in Venezuela, it is a Maduro invention."" He also accused the Maduro government of trying to move up to $1.2bn (Â£900m) in public funds to Uruguay, but did not offer any evidence. At least 17 EU countries have officially recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president of Venezuela. It follows the rejection of a deadline set by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and others for President Maduro to call new elections. Why Russia has so much to lose in Venezuela Other EU nations, such as Greece and Ireland, have called for fresh elections but stopped short of recognising Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro retains powerful allies, most notably China and Russia, who has accused EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"". The Venezuelan president also retains the crucial support of the army. Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy. There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food, and an inflation rate that last year saw prices doubling every 19 days on average. Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite.

"Councils say a more sustainable funding model is needed to ensure services continue The latest financial pot for councils in England will ""pave the way for a more confident, self-sufficient and reinvigorated local government,"" the communities secretary has said. James Brokenshire claimed local authorities would have an extra Â£1.3bn in the next financial year. But this is their estimated ""spending power"", not the guaranteed government grant, which will fall by around Â£1bn. The Local Government Association (LGA) has complained of a Â£3bn funding gap. It said ""huge uncertainty"" remained over the provision of services. MPs voted on Tuesday evening to adopt the plans. Are these councils defying the cuts? Council spending cuts, in seven charts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Council makes Â£82m budget cuts Council approves budget cuts of Â£5m The ""core spending power"" of councils will rise by Â£1.3bn or 2.8% to Â£46.4bn - which includes money raised if councils increase their tax by the maximum 3% allowed and collect strong amounts from rents and business rates. However, the central grant they get from government will drop by around Â£1bn on the current financial year. BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan said council budgets would shrink by almost 6%, meaning more services would have to be cut. Opening the debate, Mr Brokenshire said he had listened to councils who wanted more control of the money they raised, and had plans to allow more authorities to keep the business rates they collected. He also promised a review of the formula used to work out how money is split between areas, saying the current one was ""far too complicated and frankly out of date"". He said the moves would ""reboot our system"" of local government. ""Strong, vibrant resilient communities are more than ever key to unlocking a brighter future for our country,"" said the minister. ""I hold these dedicated public servants in the highest regard and have faith in them to rise to the challenges that lie ahead to see their people and places flourish with no-one left behind."" Labour's communities spokesman Andrew Gwynne said all councils had been ""hung out to dry"" by the government over the last nine years and the figure for core spending power was ""smoke and mirrors"". He added: ""There is no new new money, no new ideas, no recognition of the dire situation facing councils."" The independentInstitute for Fiscal Studies calculates that poorer council areas,externalwill lose more money that richer authorities. LGA chairman Lord Porter said: ""The money councils have to provide local services is running out fast and there is huge uncertainty about how they will pay for them into the next decade and beyond.""

"Striving for a supercharged golf swing could play havoc with your back, according to US doctors. The modern ""X-factor"" swing favoured by many professionals may hit balls harder and further but it can also put extra strain on the spine, theBarrow Neurological Institute,externalexperts say. They look at the example of Tiger Woods in their research, which is published in theJournal of Neurosurgery: Spine,external. The 43-year-old player recently made a comeback afterserious back issues. Swinging the golf club at measured speeds of 129mph at the April 2018 Master's Tournament, Tiger Woods appears to be back to physical fitness. And he has said that he now has a greater understanding of what he ""can and can't do"" this season. ""A lot of it has been training, trying to get stronger,"" he said. An X-factor golf swing tries to get maximum rotation of the player's shoulders relative to their hips at the top of the backswing. This big rotation creates wound-up potential energy - the X-factor - but Dr Corey Walker, Dr Juan Uribe and Dr Randall Porter, from Barrow, say it may come at a cost, twisting the lumbar spine. The spinal surgeons have been studying how the golf swing of present-day professionals, including Tiger Woods, differs from those of golf veterans, such as Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan. They say players' physiques and techniques have changed significantly over recent decades. Modern players are more muscular and have more powerful downswings and this can put increased force on the spinal disc and facet joints, they believe. And over time, it can result in a damaging process that the authors call ""repetitive traumatic discopathy"" (RTD). But it's not just the backswing that might injure the lower spine. During an explosive downswing, lateral flexion can result in a 'crunch"" of the side of the spine, putting strain on the disc and facet joints on one side of the spine, they say. Dr Walker said: ""We believe Tiger Woods's experience with spinal disease highlights a real and under-recognised issue amongst modern era golfers. ""Tiger was using the mechanics of the modern day swing and that places a tremendous amount of strain on the back. ""It's still a theory but we are starting to see the late stages of this in some of our patients. ""We are seeing younger and younger elite level golfers with degeneration in their lower back."" He said any golfer, elite or not, who experienced pain should seek expert help. Woods had fusion surgery on his lower spine to get back to fitness. He also did a lot of physiotherapy and strengthening exercises in the gym. This video can not be played Tiger Woods explains why he is a ""walking miracle"" Consultant physiotherapist Nigel Tilley, who has worked on the PGA European Tour, the Ryder Cup and with Team GB, said the research should be treated with some caution. ""If you scanned a lot of people in their 40s, you would see some disc degeneration,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean the necessarily have a back problem with it though. ""And Tiger has had a very long golfing career doing repetitive movements, so it's perhaps not that surprising that he has had back problems. ""But there's certainly been a change in swing style among players in the last 20 years. ""It's become much more powerful and it can put more force on the spine. "" He said it was important for golfers to control that speed to avoid injury. ""Strengthening and conditioning exercises in the gym can help reduce injuries,"" he said. ""If you are training properly, there's no reason why you can't resist these forces and have no problems or injuries. ""And golf is a great sport. I wouldn't want anyone to be put off doing it. You can play it at a very high level for a very long time."" Dr Andrea Fradkin, associate professor in exercise science at Bloomsburg University said ""Many injuries can be avoided by a good warm up."" Tiger Woods's back story He won the US Masters at Augusta in 1997 with a record score, aged 21, making him the youngest man and the first black American to earn the title His lower back pain began about 2013 In March 2014, he withdrew from the final round at the Honda Classic because of lower back pain and spasms Later that month, he had surgery (laminotomy and microdiscectomy procedures) to relieve nerve compression He needed more surgery to his spine in 2015 In 2017, he had his fourth back operation - spinal fusion - to stop the pain The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A letter from the government to Nissan, written in 2016, revealed that the Japanese carmaker would only get the money if it made the car in the UK. The government clarified that Nissan had received just Â£2.6m of the funds, but would have to reapply for the rest. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the X-Trail would have created 741 UK jobs. But he told the House of Commons that Nissan had committed to building its Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models in Sunderland, where it employs 7,000 workers. Mr Clark also said: ""While the decision was made on broader business grounds, Nissan commented on the need for us to come together and resolve the question of our future trading relationship with the EU. I believe their advice should be listened to and acted upon."" In the 2016 letter from Mr Clark,externalto Nissan's then boss, Carlos Ghosn, he said the funding was contingent ""on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant"". Mr Ghosn has since been sacked as Nissan's chairman and is in detention in Japanfollowing claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has denied the allegations. Simon Jack: The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Nissan had originally asked for Â£80m in state support, but following a review by an independent advisory committee, that figure was reduced to Â£61m. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Nissan has been given Â£2.6m and would have to reapply for the remaining Â£58.4m. On Sunday, when Nissan announced its decision not to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". The government had to clarify its position after Business Minister Richard Harrington told the BBC that Nissan would get the Â£61m support payment. Mr Harrington told BBC Newcastle: ""The Â£60m still stands. It's to do with research and development and developing alternative technologies and making sure Nissan is at the forefront of that. ""This was nothing to do with the X-Trail."" Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Mr Ghosn had hinted that he would seek compensation if car exports to Europe were subject to tariffs. Mr Ghosn met Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the future of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, after which he said he was ""confident"" that the government would keep the UK a competitive place to do business after it leaves the EU. In the letter to Mr Ghosn, Mr Clark said: ""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU."" Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said Nissan's decision not to built the X-Trail in the UK ""is a blow to production at Sunderland"". She added: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit, the reluctance to rule out 'no deal' and the lack of certainty around our future trading relationship with our biggest and nearest trading partner has made this decision sadly predictable, no matter what assurances may have been provided in the past.""

"This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa A group of Latin American countries and Canada has urged the Venezuelan military to support opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. In a statement, 11 of the 14 members of the Lima Group called for a change of power without the use of force and the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid. Mr GuaidÃ³ has declared himself interim president and won support from major powers including the US. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says he is the legitimate leader of Venezuela.

The group issued a 17-point declaration,,externalfollowing a meeting in the Canadian capital, Ottawa.

Rightful leader or usurper? Dictator or defender of socialism? The 11 group members also urged the world community ""to take measures to prevent the Maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, from having access to Venezuela's international assets and from doing business in oil, gold and other assets"".

"Not an inch? Top EU officials Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and Michel Barnier in Brussels So. How open does the EU seem almost a week on from parliament narrowly voting in favour of an amendment to find alternatives to the backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit? After all, with every passing day as we've heard , again and again and again, the clock is ticking us all towards an increased chance of a no-deal Brexit with all the costs and chaos that could involve. Well, if I were to speak in weather forecast terms, I might describe current EU attitudes as frosty with a chance of ice. If Theresa May comes to Brussels later this week, she will be received politely and listened to attentively. But if her EU ask remains centred around getting a time limit to, or allowing the UK a unilateral get-out mechanism from, the Irish border backstop or if she pushes again for pure technology as a means of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, then the likelihood of her being sent home empty-handed - or as good as - is very high indeed. Brexit: A really simple guide Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? EU reveals no-deal Brexit plans This is not because the EU has suddenly become cavalier about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit - far from it. The club may be over the moon about just sealing the world's largest ever bilateral deal with Japan but that's no replacement for trade and cooperation with neighbouring UK. It's just that the EU sees so many reasons not to budge over the backstop: solidarity with EU club member Ireland over ""caving in"" to departing member UK; defending the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process; and above all (in the eyes, hearts and pockets of many EU politicians and businesses) defending the integrity of the EU's single market. So when Sajid Javid, the UK's home secretary, announced at the weekend that sorting out the backstop would just involve ""a bit of good will"" on behalf of the EU, I could almost hear the groans of European exasperation from my Brussels living room. This is something that those in the UK who knowingly repeat that ""the EU will give in, in the end"" perhaps don't fully appreciate. The EU certainly does budge at times, even when it has repeatedly ruled out such a move but it performs U-turns out of self-interest, to safeguard the bloc in some way. Take the oft-cited Greek debt crisis - the EU acted in the interest of the eurozone currency. That is ultimately why it changed its line on member country Greece. Eurozone bailout programme is finally over The Brussels calculation is that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging for the EU but exposing the entire EU single market to clear vulnerabilities would be the worst of two evils. The backstop guarantee for the Irish border ensures a means of sealing the long, meandering, porous border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in a way that technology alone (as many Brexiteers are suggesting) cannot. The EU worries about tariff-dodging and about non-EU standard products being smuggled into the EU's single market ""through the back door"" - via Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop If technology alone could seal a border in terms of customs and regulatory checks then you would no longer see the existing infrastructure in place between close allies and neighbours non-EU Norway and EU member Sweden or between Switzerland, which has very tight relations with the European Union, and its EU neighbours. So, instead of dramatically changing or weakening the backstop, the EU is more than happy - as officials indicated today to visiting members of the UK's parliamentary Brexit Select Committee - to repeat or re-package its previous reassurances about the backstop. For example: That the backstop is a fall-back mechanism, not intended to be used That all sides would prefer to complete a ""deep and ambitious"" trade deal that would obviate the need for the backstop That if such a trade deal were not completed in time, the backstop would not need to be triggered if the transition period (in which the UK legally leaves the EU but remains a member in practical terms while new trade relations are being negotiated) were extended. An important aside on the transition period: there's a new proposal the EU understands is now being championed by Downing Street - The Malthouse Compromise. Brussels would likely reject this, not only because it seeks to rewrite the backstop but because it suggests paying the EU to extend the transition period even in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The EU argues (and this is included in the text of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement) that if the Brexit deal is not passed by the House of Commons, there will be no transition period. Full stop. Now, the EU is not at all convinced that re-hashing assurances about the backstop will be enough to satisfy MPs who voted to change it. They believe the bar set by the DUP and hard-line Brexiteers is too high for any tweaks the EU might be willing to make. Which leaves EU leaders sceptical that Theresa May actually has the majority of MPs behind her. Just this weekend for example, the EU's deputy chief Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, retweeted a UK commentator pointing out signs of splintering in the brief truce inside the Conservative Party. Which is why the EU will continue to show ice-cold resolve - at least for now. Hoping, by not giving an inch over the backstop, that the Prime Minister will be forced to look across the political divide, to the Labour Party, for another means to find parliamentary support for the Brexit Deal - such as opting for a permanent customs union with the EU. This is the EU's hope. But European diplomats see in Theresa May a politician who likes sticking to her Plan A's. Is the UK Prime Minister simply playing for time? From the beginning we've discussed the big possibility that with such a divided country, parliament, party and cabinet, the prime minister will simply keep playing for time, inching forward small step by small step until so close to the cliff-edge of having no Brexit deal at all that most MPs will end up backing her and her deal at the very last moment. This is high-risk brinkmanship. Dublin is deeply concerned about the consequences of a no deal Brexit - for peace above all but also about the impact on the Irish economy. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar heads to Brussels this Wednesday for high-level meetings. That same day his deputy flies to Washington to lobby for US support to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the Irish border stays open. Could US disapproval over UK pressure on the backstop makes things more complicated for a future UK-US trade deal? It won't make things any simpler.

"Theresa May says she has ""fresh mandate and renewed determination"" to revisit the Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May says she intends to return to Brussels with new ideas on the Irish backstop. The EU has already dismissed the idea of putting a time limit on the backstop, so what other ideas have been suggested? The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. If the UK leaves the customs union and the single market that could mean goods would have to be checked as they crossed the frontier. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? The UK and EU would instead like to keep the border frictionless through a comprehensive trade deal. If such an agreement could not be reached, then to avoid those checks with customs posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Many MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in that arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. The prime minister's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) allies also do not want to see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. Clarification - and another referendum The Irish economist Karl Whelan has suggested thatthe EU should clarify that it has no objections to Great Britain leaving the customs union backstop,externalwhile Northern Ireland stays in it. ""This is the original version of the backstop that the EU offered, so it should be clear they are willing to still offer this,"" says Prof Whelan. That would leave Great Britain free to strike trade deals but Northern Ireland would not be part of them. That would be anathema to the DUP and other MPs. The DUP's Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster want NI to be treated the same as the rest of the UK after Brexit The second part of Prof Whelan's plan is to use the Brexit political declaration to promise the citizens of Northern Ireland a referendum on the backstop, should it ever come into effect. He suggests that five years after the beginning of the operation of a Northern Ireland-only backstop there would be a vote on whether to remain within the EU's customs union and single market. He says: ""A promise to hold a referendum five years after the end of the transition period would provide a clear concession to those who believe the backstop arrangements would be harmful to Northern Ireland by offering them a chance to convince their fellow citizens to end the arrangements after a period."" A European customs association A paper for the German Ifo Institute suggests thatthe difficulties with the backstop should cause both sides to fundamentally rethink,externaltheir red lines. It proposes a new European customs association - a permanent customs union between the UK and the EU. It would be superior to the customs deal Turkey has with the EU giving the UK ""full and active participation"", instead of merely being a rule-taker. However, it acknowledges even that would not be enough to keep the Irish border frictionless and the UK would have to effectively remain in the single market for goods and perhaps services. The Irish border has been one of the most contentious Brexit issues In return for such an enormous u-turn by the UK, the institute says that the EU should also make a radical change on free movement. The EU's position is that the UK cannot enjoy full participation in the single market unless it accepts the four freedoms - one of which is the free movement of people. The institute says the EU could ""abandon its indivisibility dogma by which the four freedoms are inseparable, offering the UK to participate in product market integration but allowing it to make its own choices in other areas"". It adds: ""Most importantly, this concerns the mobility of people."" Beef up the political declaration The political declaration was published alongside the withdrawal deal and sets out the broad shape of the future relationship between the UK and EU. EU leaders have said they are open to redrafting the declaration if the UK presents new ideas. The former Liberal Democrat MEP Andrew Duff has, in a paper for the European Policy Centre, suggestedimprovements aimed at ""rescuing"" the withdrawal agreement,external. Please upgrade your browser He says that the language on the temporary nature of the backstop could be clearer and ""more forceful"". However, given the prime minister's intention to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement changes to the political declaration are unlikely to impress pro-Brexit MPs. Ireland leaves the EU customs union Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister's former senior adviser Nick Timothy suggested thatIreland could leave the EU's customs union and instead create a joint customs territory,externalwith the EU. That would eliminate the possibility of customs checks at the Irish border but mean new customs procedures between Ireland and the EU. Mr Timothy said that would build on existing policies and would help to protect Irish consumers and businesses. However, in Ireland there is near universal hostility to any suggestion that Brexit should force it to weaken its position in the EU. Mr Timothy appeared to acknowledge that reality, writing: ""No doubt this idea will be attacked as another unicorn.""

"Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A letter from the government to Nissan, written in 2016, revealed that the Japanese carmaker would only get the money if it made the car in the UK. The government clarified that Nissan had received just Â£2.6m of the funds, but would have to reapply for the rest. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the X-Trail would have created 741 UK jobs. But he told the House of Commons that Nissan had committed to building its Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models in Sunderland, where it employs 7,000 workers. Mr Clark also said: ""While the decision was made on broader business grounds, Nissan commented on the need for us to come together and resolve the question of our future trading relationship with the EU. I believe their advice should be listened to and acted upon."" In the 2016 letter from Mr Clark,externalto Nissan's then boss, Carlos Ghosn, he said the funding was contingent ""on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant"". Mr Ghosn has since been sacked as Nissan's chairman and is in detention in Japanfollowing claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has denied the allegations. Simon Jack: The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Nissan had originally asked for Â£80m in state support, but following a review by an independent advisory committee, that figure was reduced to Â£61m. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Nissan has been given Â£2.6m and would have to reapply for the remaining Â£58.4m. On Sunday, when Nissan announced its decision not to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". The government had to clarify its position after Business Minister Richard Harrington told the BBC that Nissan would get the Â£61m support payment. Mr Harrington told BBC Newcastle: ""The Â£60m still stands. It's to do with research and development and developing alternative technologies and making sure Nissan is at the forefront of that. ""This was nothing to do with the X-Trail."" Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Mr Ghosn had hinted that he would seek compensation if car exports to Europe were subject to tariffs. Mr Ghosn met Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the future of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, after which he said he was ""confident"" that the government would keep the UK a competitive place to do business after it leaves the EU. In the letter to Mr Ghosn, Mr Clark said: ""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU."" Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said Nissan's decision not to built the X-Trail in the UK ""is a blow to production at Sunderland"". She added: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit, the reluctance to rule out 'no deal' and the lack of certainty around our future trading relationship with our biggest and nearest trading partner has made this decision sadly predictable, no matter what assurances may have been provided in the past.""

"This video can not be played The fire was brought under control in the early hours of Tuesday morning Ten people including a baby have died in a fire at an eight-storey building in south-western Paris, officials say. More than 30 people - including six firefighters - were injured. One person is in a serious condition. Fifty people were evacuated by ladders from the blaze in the upmarket 16th arrondissement. Investigators believe the fire - one of the most deadly in the French capital in years - was possibly started deliberately. A woman detained earlier by police is no longer being questioned and, after undergoing medical and behavioural tests, has been admitted to the psychiatric infirmary of the Paris police, media reports quote the Paris prosecutor as saying. Earlier,French President Emmanuel Macron said the country ""had woken up to tragedy,external"", and praised the fire services for their courage. Rue Erlanger is a residential street close to the Parc des Princes football stadium and the Roland-Garros tennis venue. The fire started on the second floor and spread across the block - built in the 1970s, unlike many of the older, classic Parisian buildings nearby - shortly after 01:00 (00:00 GMT), forcing some residents to scramble on to nearby rooftops to escape the flames and smoke. This video can not be played A survivor describes how she ""jumped across balconies"" to escape An eyewitness at the scene told French television: ""The fire alarm went off at 00:30, a little after midnight, and smoke was everywhere already. I live on the eighth floor, the top floor, so I tried to pass from balcony to balcony to get away, And then we huddled up in a corner. Other people climbed up to where I was to escape the flames."" About 250 firefighters were deployed to the scene, not far from the Bois de Boulogne park, helping to rescue those trapped on the roofs. Pictures showed flames coming from the top floor windows and firefighters in breathing apparatus scaling ladders to reach residents. Rescue efforts were initially hampered by the fact that the apartments on fire were inside an inner courtyard with no vehicle access. ""When we arrived, we were faced with an apocalyptic situation. Lots of people were calling for help from the windows,"" a spokesman for the fire service said. Firefighters said the building's courtyard had acted as a funnel, helping the flames to spread from the lower to the upper floors. Six firefighters are among the injured,external, officials say. The fire is one of the deadliest Paris has seen in years The fire was brought under control after a five-hour operation. Surrounding buildings in the area have been evacuated as a precaution. Town hall officials have been tasked with finding alternative accommodation. On Tuesday afternoon, architects working for the Paris police assessed the building and said there was ""a serious and imminent danger to the occupants"", who are therefore barred from returning for now. An investigation has been opened into the criminal charge of causing death by arson. Several local residents said the fire had started after a dispute between neighbours in the block over loud music. It was not immediately known what had caused the fire ParisMayor Anne Hidalgo sent her condolences to the victims, and visited the site,externalon Tuesday morning, along with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Just a few weeks earlier,four people were killed after a huge blast at a bakeryin the centre of the city. Hugh Schofield, BBC News Paris This is a well-to-do apartment building in an affluent neighbourhood. Other recent, deadly fires in Paris have been in poor, overcrowded areas where safety norms have clearly being ignored. By mid-morning, the fire had been extinguished and normal life was resuming. Sounds of children playing came from a schoolyard next door. The building is on an inner courtyard, so from outside there was no sign at all of the anguish and the drama. Firefighters were widely praised for saving 50 people from the building But groups of people were milling about, residents from neighbouring buildings who had been told to leave their homes. They wanted to know when they could go back. The occasional witness arrived who saw it all: the screaming, the flames, the people on seventh-floor window ledges staring into the void. They said they wouldn't ever forget.

"This video can not be played BBC Radio 1's Nesta McGregor on what we don't know about 21 Savage A lawyer for US rapper 21 Savage says he will fight to stay in the US after an arrest by immigration agents who say he is British and in the US illegally. Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, 26, came to America in July 2005 aged 12 and failed to leave when his visa expired a year later, US officials say. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) also say the musician is a convicted felon. His lawyer accused the US of trying to ""intimidate"" the rapper into leaving. Attorney Charles Kuck said in a statement on Monday that the arrest was ""based upon incorrect information about prior criminal charges"" and that his client had never tried to conceal his immigration status from authorities. In 2017, he applied for a US ""U Visa"" on the basis that he had been the ""victim of crime"", his lawyer said. U Visas are given to non-citizen victims of crime who intend to co-operate with US authorities. In 2013, the rapper was shot six times on his 21st birthday in an attack that took the life of his best friend. Mr Kuck added the rapper is ""not a flight risk"" and is a ""prominent member of the music industry"" who would be recognised if he attempted to flee. The lawyer said the rapper also has US-born children, which Mr Kuck argued should prevent his client's deportation. 21 questions about 21 Savage ""ICE has not charged Mr Abraham-Joseph with any crime,"" Mr Kuck continued. ""As a minor, his family overstayed their work visas, and he, like almost two million other children, was left without legal status through no fault of his own."" The lawyer accused US immigration officials of trying to ""unnecessarily punish him and try to intimidate him into giving up his right to fight to remain in the United States"". Mr Kuck said his client was ""clearly not a danger to the community"" and is ""the type of immigrant we want in America"". A DeKalb County Police Department incident report says the rapper was arrested on Sunday during a traffic stop. Mr Abraham-Joseph was detained by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a federal law enforcement agency. A fellow musician, Quantavious Thomas, known as Young Nudy, was also arrested during the traffic stop. Mr Thomas is accused of aggravated assault with a gun and participation in criminal street gang activity. According to ICE, Mr Abraham-Joseph was convicted of drug charges in 2014 and his arrest on Sunday was a ""targeted operation"". An ICE spokesman added that when the rapper was first arrested, ICE was not aware of his immigration status. ""His whole public persona is false,"" said an ICE agent, adding that his childhood was not actually spent in the US. The UK Foreign Office told BBC News: ""Our staff are in contact with the lawyer of a British man following his detention in the USA."" 'Are all undocumented immigrants criminals?' The effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town Previous to his arrest by immigration officials, Abraham-Joseph has described a childhood in Atlanta, Georgia, not the UK. In an interview with Fader magazine in 2016 he said he had first seen a gun at the age of eight - though the article did not specify where this purported incident took place. The musician is also quoted as saying he was expelled from school in Atlanta aged about 12 or 13 for taking a gun to class. His music has drawn controversy at times, with the rapper apologising last December for a lyric on his second album that referenced ""Jewish money"". But since finding fame, 21 Savage has contributed to financial literacy programmes with underprivileged youth. A fan in Atlanta told the BBC: ""He's an icon for here. He's making great music. We're losing someone big."" 21 questions about 21 Savage LeBron apologises for 'Jewish money' post The effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'
