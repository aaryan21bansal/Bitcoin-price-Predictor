"Bombardier, Norbrook pharmaceuticals and Graham construction group signed the letter Some of NI's largest businesses have written to MPs,externalurging them not to let the UK leave the EU without a deal. They say that no-deal would ""result in significant damage to our export markets, supply chains, consumer spending power and the region's competitiveness"". The letter has been organised by the employers organisation, the CBI. The DUP have said they should not ""fall into line with the Government's attempt to foist a really bad deal on the UK"". The signatories are a range of locally-owned and multi-national businesses. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Big Brexit vote- What do I need to know Aerospace firm Bombardier, Norbrook pharmaceuticals and Graham construction group are among the signatories. The letter suggests that a no-deal could lead to the introduction of new checks at the Irish border. It states: ""A no deal Brexit will undoubtedly result in creating regulatory and tariff differences across the island of Ireland and will therefore have direct consequences for border checks and crossings. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button ""We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland's economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit."" Responding to the letter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: ""It is clear that there is a coordinated attempt to railroad MPs into accepting the toxic, union-destroying, Northern Ireland economy-damaging deal, which the prime minister had previously agreed with the EU. ""It is important that businesses in Northern Ireland do not simply fall into line with the government's attempt to foist a really bad deal on the UK because of its incompetence in negotiations."" Last week,the head of the NI civil service warned that a no-deal Brexit could have ""grave"" consequencesincluding a ""sharp increase in unemployment"".

"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" It was too dangerous to send British officials to rescue Shamima Begum's baby son in Syria, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. The child died in a refugee camp after his mother, who joined IS in 2015, was stripped of UK citizenship. The boy was a UK citizen - but Mr Hunt told the BBC that any rescuers' lives would have been at risk in the camp. ""The mother chose to leave a free country to join a terrorist organisation,"" he said. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the foreign secretary confirmed that Jarrah, who was three weeks old, was a British citizen even though his mother was not. But he said that - although several journalists had reached the camp and spoken to Ms Begum - ""we have to think about the safety of the British officials that I would send into that warzone"". ""Shamima knew when she made the decision to join Daesh, she was going into a country where there was no embassy, there was no consular assistance, and I'm afraid those decisions, awful though it is, they do have consequences,"" he said. He said that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development were looking at ways to find the British children of other so-called ""Islamic State brides"" and get them out. This video can not be played Ahmed Ali on his daughter Shamima Begum: ""She has done wrong, whether or not she realised it"" Details have emerged of two more women from the UK, who are in Syrian camps with their young children, who have been stripped of their citizenship. Reema Iqbal and her sister, Zara, from east London, were firstnamed by The Sunday Times,external, quoting legal sources. Sources told the BBC that the decision to remove their citizenship was taken by the former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who left office in April 2018. The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases. Decisions to withdraw citizenship from individuals were evidence-based and not taken lightly, it added. The use of the powers has risen sharply, with 104 deprivations of citizenship in 2017, compared to 50 in the previous decade, according to Home Officefigures obtained by the immigration law website Free Movement,external. Many cases have involved national security and supporters of groups such as Al-Qaeda butcriminals - including three of the Rochdale grooming gang -have also been stripped of citizenship. The Sunday Times says that Reema, 30, and Zara, 28, are living in separate refugee camps in Syria - along with thousands of other families who have fled from territory formerly controlled by jihadis. Between them they have five boys under the age of eight, it says. The parents of the sisters are originally from Pakistan, but it is not known if they have dual nationality. I apologise to Britain, says Shamima Begum's dad What was life like for Shamima Begum? According to the Sunday Times, the sisters left for Syria in 2013 after marrying IS fighters with ""close links"" to the filmed murders of western hostages. Zara was heavily pregnant with her second child when she travelled to Syria and later gave birth to a third. Reema has one son born in the UK and another born in Syria. Home Secretary Sajid Javid hasfaced criticismfor his handling of the similar case of Ms Begum. Her three-week-old son, Jarrah, died of pneumonia on Thursday, according to a medical certificate. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the child had died as a result of the ""callous and inhumane"" decision to strip Ms Begum of her citizenship - while Tory MP and former justice minister Phillip Lee urged the government to ""reflect"" on its ""moral responsibility"" for the tragedy. A UK government spokesman said: ""The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family.""

"Several cars were damaged when winds ripped scaffolding into a road in west London Cars were crushed by scaffolding and a supermarket roof was ripped off as strong winds battered the country. A plank of wood smashed through a taxi window, which witnesses said narrowly missed a passenger in the back seat, in west London. The wind caused travel disruption, including delays at the Dartford Crossing as the QEII bridge was closed. The Met Office said 70mph gusts were recorded,externalon the Isle of Portland, off Weymouth. Cross-Channel ferries to Kent and the Isle of Wight were also delayed, but services are now back to normal. The QEII bridge has since reopened but has a 30mph speed limit, meaning delays are expected to continue.

"This video can not be played Clonduff camogie champions Two teams battle for more than 70 minutes. A whistle blows, a moment of disbelief, then one team explodes in ecstasy, the other collapses in despair. That's exactly what happened last Sunday as south Down camogie side Clonduff held on, just, to defeat Waterford club GailltÃ­r to win the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Club Championship final. The final score in Croke Park in Dublin was Clonduff 0-10, GailltÃ­r 0-09. Clonduff captain Paula Gribben was the hero, firing over six points to help the 'Yellas' win the title for the first time. Sara-Louise Carr popped over three points and her sister Fionnuala added the other score, a shot so impressive it went viral on Twitter. Their father, Ross Carr, a two times all-Ireland Gaelic football winner with Down, tweeted that Sunday was the ""greatest day"" of his life. But why did it mean so much? For Sara-Louise Carr, it was because the win brought ""so much happiness"" to the whole local community. Clonduff's ""dream came true"" with their win in Croke Park Paula Gribben says being the first Clonduff team to play in Croke Park made it a special and historical event with the team feeling the whole community willing them on. Clonduff remains bedecked in bunting, flags and posters in support of the team. The club fields no less than six sets of sisters - the Gribbens, (Karen and Paula), the Carrs (Fionnuala & Sara-Louise), the Fitzpatricks (Cassie & Beth), the McGilligans (Clare & Katie), the Wilsons (Lizzie & Hannah) and Livelys (Ellen & Erin). ""Win, lose or draw, you always have each others' back,"" Paula says of her sister Karen. ""When the final whistle blows, it's one of the first people you go to find."" Sara-Louise and Fionnuala acknowledge that they are competitive, but say they also advise each other. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Katie and Clare McGilligan are the daughters of club chair Guinevra and team manager Alastair, and are cousins of the Carr sisters. Being sisters just made the victory extra special, they say. They describe the experience as simply ""class"" with the community's reactions making the team feel like ""royalty"". Beth and Cassie Fitzpatrick say their feelings are indescribable, adding it was a very proud day for their parents and wider family. ""When the game was over and you looked up into the stand, men, women and children were crying, it was unbelievable."" This video can not be played Clonduff celebrate All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Club title Paula Gribben, reluctantly, admits that the camogie team has been more successful than Clonduff's male teams but was at pains to point out that all of the club's teams back each other. She acknowledges that her team are now role models. ""You're a player your whole life, you look up to other people and other people inspire you,"" Paula says. Allow Twitter content?

""You never think that you're going to be someone else's inspiration. ""But after Sunday, you realise we are role models for six, seven, eight year olds coming through. ""Success drives interest, I think with the success of this camogie, it will get a lot more families, a lot more girls involved,"" she says. Fionnuala Carr echoed those thoughts, saying that a player only has a short period of time on the pitch, and it was important to inspire a new generation. Orla Morgan, a Clonduff player for 27 years, missed out on the final due to a problem not encountered by male sports people. She found out she was eight-weeks pregnant four weeks after the Ulster final, ruling her out of contention. ""It's part of female sporting life,"" she says. Karen Gribben, who has three children, including a six-month-old, says pregnancy is a reality in women's sport, but that mothers can continue to play. The whole club is one big happy family, she says, but one of the first people she met on the pitch after the final whistle was her nine-year-old son Jimmy, who had run out looking for his mum. Clonduff Camogie club was first formed in 1951 but folded after a short time before reforming in 1967. It fields teams at all levels from under-sixes to to seniors. The level a team plays at club level is dictated by the level its county plays. Down play at Intermediate level and were in the All-Ireland Intermediate final in 2018 with 10 Clonduff players on the panel. The word camogie comes from the Irish camÃ³gaÃ­ocht and refers to the act of wielding the camogie stick, or hurl, 'the little bend'. The game is very similar to its male equivalent, hurling, and is considered one of Ireland's Gaelic games. Hurling has ancient origins and is closely related to its Scottish and Manx cousins, shinty and cammag. The modern game of camogie is regulated by the Camogie Association, founded in 1904. The consensus seems to be that 'three-in-a-row' is the now the team's aim. Although it is understood that the girls intend to take a ""few more weeks off"" to engage in some ""team-bonding"" activities. Clonduff GAA fields no less than 23 teams across hurling, Gaelic football and camogie as well as supporting the area's handballers. The village of Hilltown, the only one in Clonduff, has expanded rapidly in recent years but many of its young people still feel that a life overseas is a better option. Clonduff people and their descendents are found all over the world - many of whom follow and support their home club from afar. Clonduff also takes an active part in the GAA's cultural competition, the ScÃ³r. Local girl Aoife Trainor is currently the young All-Ireland champion in solo singing. She won the title singing 'SlÃ¡n Abhaile' (safe home) in memory of her six-year-old sister who died following a car crash near Newry in 2016. This video can not be played 'Legendary' Slaughtneil achievement is 'the stuff of dreams' Clonduff was not the only Ulster camogie team to win an All-Ireland title on Sunday. Slaughtneill, another club with huge importance to its community, won the senior championship. Tina Hannon hit 1-6 to secure Slaughtneill's third straight senior club title by defeating St Martin's 1-9 to 0-7 in the final. In 2016, Slaughtneil became the first club to win provincial titles in Gaelic football, hurling and camogie in the same year. The club did it again in 2017 with the senior teams clinching provincial success in all three codes.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tells Andrew Marr the Conservative party is ""in very perilous waters"" Conservative MPs should back Theresa May's deal this week or risk losing Brexit altogether, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned. There was ""wind in the sails"" of those opposing Brexit and the consequences for the party will be ""devastating"", if it is not delivered, he said. MPs will vote again on the deal on Tuesday, after rejecting it in January. Labour's John McDonnell said it looked like the PM had failed to secure any changes and it would be rejected again. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Minister rejects 'May should quit' reports SNP to ask for Indyref powers if UK leaves EU MPs will vote for a second time on Tuesday on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the European Union - after rejecting it by a historic margin in January. If they reject it again, they will get a vote on leaving without a deal, and if that fails, on delaying the exit date. Many Conservative Brexiteers voted against the deal in January over concerns about the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But there have been few visible signs of progress over the issue in continuing talks between EU and UK officials. Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show some MPs wanted to ""kill"" the deal, in order to delay Brexit, with the ultimate aim of getting another referendum on the issue. ""Within three weeks, those people could have two of those three things,"" he said, adding that Labour's position made the third more likely. He said: ""We are in very perilous waters, and people who want to make sure that we really do deliver this result need to remember that if it fails... they are going to say: 'There was a party that promised to deliver Brexit, we put them into No 10 and they failed', and the consequences for us as a party, would be devastating."" He added: ""We have an opportunity now to leave on March 29, or shortly thereafter. And it's very important that we grasp that opportunity because there is wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit."" If Parliament approves Mrs May's withdrawal agreement next week and the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, it will begin a transition period, when the two sides will attempt to agree a comprehensive trade deal. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the transition period, the ""backstop"" plan is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell: ""This is the mess the PM has got us into"" It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But some MPs fear that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. On Friday, Mrs May urged the EU to help her get the deal through by resolving concerns about the backstop. But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""It looks as though she's bringing back the same deal so it looks as though we will have the same result and it will be thrown out."" He said the party's priority this week would be to stop Theresa May ""driving through some sort of Brexit deal that will damage our economy and undermine jobs"" and if that meant a delay to allow for a discussion about the deal Labour backs instead ""so be it"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. He also denied that Labour's support for keeping the option of another referendum open had been put on the backburner, adding: ""If Parliament can't agree, if we have to break the logjam, yes, we will keep the option available of going back to the people."" And he said he believed that Labour's alternative Brexit deal could be agreed with the EU ""within a matter of weeks"" but said any delay requested should be ""as long as is necessary"". Labour's policy is to seek a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr McDonnell said the EU had ""looked positively"" on the proposal. On Friday, the EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances it has already made about the withdrawal deal and its chief negotiator Michel Barniertweeted,externalthat the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she was deeply disappointed by the EU's proposal, which has already been rejected by the UK government.

"The government says the bill will reduce Russia's reliance on foreign internet servers Thousands of people in Russia have protested against plans to introduce tighter restrictions on the internet. A mass rally in Moscow and similar demonstrations in two other cities were called after parliament backed the controversial bill last month. The government says the bill, which allows it to isolate Russia's internet service from the rest of the world, will improve cyber-security. But campaigners say it is an attempt to increase censorship and stifle dissent. Activists say more than 15,000 people gathered in Moscow on Sunday, which is double the estimate given by the police. Some protesters chanted slogans such as ""hands off the internet"" and ""no to isolation"" while others gave speeches on a large stage. Russia considers 'unplugging' from internet Artists on Russia's culture, identity and censorship YouTube and Instagram face Russian bans ""If we do nothing it will get worse,"" one protester told Reuters news agency. ""The authorities will keep following their own way and the point of no return will be passed."" Another campaigner, Sergei Boiko, told AFP news agency that ""the government is battling freedom"". ""I can tell you this as somebody who spent a month in jail for a tweet,"" he added. Some protesters were reportedly detained by police Opposition figures said that a number of protesters were detained in Moscow, but the police have not confirmed this. One correspondent for AFP reported seeing a man being dragged away from the rally by his arms and legs. The government says the so-called digital sovereignty bill will reduce Russia's reliance on internet servers in the United States. It seeks to stop the country's internet traffic being routed through foreign servers. A second vote is expected later this month. If it is passed it will eventually need to be signed by President Vladimir Putin. Campaigners say the new bill is an attempt to increase censorship Russia has introduced a swathe of tougher internet laws in recent years. On Thursday, its parliament passed two bills outlawing ""disrespect"" of authorities and the spreading of what the government deems to be ""fake news"". And last year, campaigners took to the streets to protestthe media watchdog's attempt to shut down the encrypted messaging service, Telegram.

"The Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the US, are fighting to clear Baghuz of militants The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have launched another assault on the Islamic State group's last enclave in Syria. Head of the SDF media office,Mustafa Bali, tweeted their troops were in ""direct violent clashes"",external. Islamic State militants are centred in the town of Baghuz in eastern Syria. Once the village is taken, the US and its allies are expected to formally declare the end of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. Exclusive pictures of final Islamic State group bastion Tales from inside the chaos left by IS After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Despite the loss of territory, the group is still seen as a major security threat capable of mounting attacks in the region and worldwide. The group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching across Syria and neighbouring Iraq, imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. After five years of fierce battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq. Sunday's attack began at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), with air strikes aimed at weapons stores. SDF and coalition planes are involved in the assault, and the militant camp is now ablaze. But the SDF has said before that it had launched a ""final assault"". After intense air and artillery strikes on 1 March, the alliance said it had to slow down the offensive ""due to a small number of civilians held as human shields"". About 3,000 people were evacuated on Monday and another 3,500, including 500 militants who surrendered, followed on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a further 2,000 people left Baghuz, Reuters news agency reported. They were taken to an SDF checkpoint where they were searched, questioned and given food and water. Mr Bali told Reuters news agency no further civilians had come out of the town since Saturday. He also said more than 4,000 militants have surrendered in the past month. Five SDF fighters who had been held hostage by IS were also freed. But Mr Bali tweeted thatthe fate of other hostages remained unknown,external, including those of Italian priest Paolo Dall'Oglio and Lebanese journalist Samir Kassab. By Quentin Sommerville, BBC Middle East correspondent What's left of the Islamic State group enclave is an easy target - a couple of tented encampments surrounded on all sides and under regular bombardment from coalition warplanes. But the Kurds have taken an incremental approach. Attacking Baghuz and then calling ceasefires to allow IS supporters, hostages and children to leave. Sunday saw dozens of lorries arrive to evacuate more, but only a handful of people left. This might be the final assault, or it might be another ploy to again force people to leave. The fighting won't be easy. The Islamic State group has riddled the area with homemade explosives and still has plentiful supplies of ammunition and weapons. Clearing the last enclave could take days, if not longer. It is thought that the IS leadership has already fled. Despite losing nearly all the territory it once held across Iraq and Syria, experts still believe the group constitutes a major threat. US National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an interview on Sunday the group had fighters ""scattered still around Syria and Iraq and that [IS] itself is growing in other parts of the world"". US President Donald Trump has previously said Islamic State was defeated, but Mr Bolton clarified the president's statements. ""He has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of IS in total,"" he said. ""We know that's not the case."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The Worldwide Threat Assessment report,external, presented to the Senate in January, also highlighted the continuing dangers of the group. While IS will probably not immediately aim to take new territory, the report assesses its militants will try to ""exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term"".

"The zoo confirmed that the animal would not be punished (file photo) A woman who stepped over a barrier to take a selfie at a zoo in Arizona, US, has been attacked by a jaguar. It happened on Saturday and the woman's injuries were not life-threatening. When she crossed the barrier and approached the enclosure to photograph herself with the jaguar, it swiped out through the fencing, leaving deep gashes on her arms. Wildlife World Zoo director Mickey Ollson said there was ""no way to fix people crossing barriers"". ""They're there for a good reason,"" he said. He said the same animal had previously attacked someone else who crossed the barrier, but not as seriously. He confirmed that Saturday's incident was the result of ""human error"" and the animal would not be euthanised.

"A fire has destroyed an internationally-renowned bird observatory on Fair Isle in Shetland. Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, at about 11:20 on Sunday. Extra fire crews were flown in from Sumburgh by helicopter with others arriving on the island by boat. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the building had been ""lost to fire"", adding it was ""absolutely tragic news"". A family including two children who live in the flat adjoining the lodge were unhurt. There are no guests staying at the lodge for the winter season. Mr Dennis said: ""Thank goodness no loss of life but heartfelt sympathy to David, Susannah and family and the islanders. We will rebuild. We have lost much and will lose a year. Close to my heart - very very sad."" And Shetland MSP Tavish Scott described it as a ""colossal blow to the isle"". The smoke from the blaze could be seen for miles Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) recorded migration patterns One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. The fire is understood to have started in the roof. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. A statement on the Fair Isle Observatory & Guesthouse website said: ""A major fire has tragically destroyed the Obs."" A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Operations Control mobilised crews from Fair Isle and Shetland, with the crew from Lerwick transported via the Maritime Coastguard Agency's Search and Rescue helicopter. ""Further resources were later mobilised to help tackle the fire, with two crews transported from Shetland to Fair Isle with the assistance of the RNLI."" The observatory is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

"This video can not be played Phoebe Waller-Bridge: ""So many potholes in the road"" for people with feminist values. The co-creator and star ofFleabagsays she worries about being labelled a ""bad feminist"" when writing the TV comedy. Phoebe Waller-Bridge told the BBC's Andrew Marr that there were ""so many potholes in the road"" for people with feminist values. And the dramatist, who is also behind the hit seriesKilling Eve, said audiences were ""exhausted by seeing women being brutalised on screen"". There was something ""oddly empowering"" about women being violent, she said. Fleabag is back - and she's found religion Fleabag: How to make people laugh by Phoebe Waller-Bridge Fleabag series two review Waller-Bridge has been lauded for her portrayal of a hapless, sex-obsessed and dry-witted protagonist in Fleabag. Asked by Andrew Marr if her ""voracious"" character in the show was the kind of person ""having fingers wagged against her by feminists"", she agreed. Waller-Bridge said: ""When I was first writing her, that felt like the most honest and frightening thing to put out there: Am I doing this right?"" At one point in the first episode of the programme, her character is asked if she would trade five years of her life for the ""perfect body"". She says she would and whispers to her sister: ""We're bad feminists."" Waller-Bridge said: ""You're not supposed to say those sorts of things."" At the time the show was created, Waller-Bridge said she wanted to live by feminist ideals, but also had ""bad thoughts"" and did things that appeared not to ""align with the message"". ""A lot of women - and probably some men as well - feel like they could fall into a trap of being a bad feminist, which is somebody who doesn't tick all the boxes of what it is to be a perfect feminist, or be a perfect spokeswoman for the cause,"" she said. ""There are so many potholes in the road. It's kind of frightening and you want to be able to say the right things."" Why so many young women 'aren't feminists' Meghan 'hopes baby will be a feminist' Waller-Bridge also spoke about the violence that featured in another of her shows, Killing Eve. The series, which is based on a thriller by British novelist Luke Jennings, was developed by Waller-Bridge for BBC America. It follows an MI5 officer as she tries to track down a female assassin and the obsessive relationship between the two women. ""People are slightly exhausted by seeing women being brutalised on screen,"" said Waller-Bridge. ""We're being allowed to see women on slabs the whole time and being beaten up. ""Seeing women be violent - the flipside of that - there's something instantly refreshing and oddly empowering."" But she said there was ""hardly any"" blood shown in Killing Eve. ""The challenge was to make it feel very violent without actually showing anything,"" she added. ""I think that's a very different experience for an audience.""

"Stephen Hawking died in March last year Stephen Hawking's former nurse has been suspended and is facing a misconduct allegation over his care. Patricia Dowdy, 61, who worked for the renowned scientist for 15 years, was handed an interim suspension in 2016. A six-week Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing, which began in February and is due to last until 21 March, is being held behind closed doors in London. Mrs Dowdy told The Mail on Sunday,externalshe was upset and did not want to comment. Prof Hawking died at his home in Cambridge in March last year aged 76 having lived with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years. The alleged misconduct by Mrs Dowdy, from Ipswich in Suffolk, took place in Cambridge, according to the NMC's register of hearings. Director of fitness to practise at the nursing watchdog, Matthew McClelland, said its legislation and guidance was ""very clear that hearings will usually take place in public"". But he said that ""in some cases, including this particular case, there are reasons why this may not always happen"". This could be ""due to the health of those involved in the case, or that the allegations are related to a health condition of the nurse or midwife"", he added. This video can not be played A look back at the life of famous scientist Stephen Hawking Prof Hawking, who was known as one of the world's finest scientific minds, was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease in 1964 at the age of 22 and was given just a few years to live.

"Labour's John McDonnell has welcomed a potential investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in his party. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it is considering a formal inquiry following a number of complaints, including from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. The shadow chancellor told the BBC he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in the way it tackles anti-Semitism. He added: ""Let's get on with it now"". Jeremy Corbyn has said anti-Semitism has ""no place whatsoever"" in the party. Labour peers' 'alarm' at anti-Semitism row Labour could face human rights probe A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The Labour Party has been dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism over the last two years. On Friday, the chair of Labour peers wrote to party leader Mr Corbyn to express ""alarm"" at the ""ongoing failure"" to resolve the issue - something they said ""diminishes the moral authority of the Labour Party"". The EHRC is asking Labour to work with it to improve its processes.  It has raised concerns with the party, which has two weeks to respond before it decides whether to take enforcement action - which can range from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. The watchdog, which was set up by the Labour government in 2006, said it believed the party ""may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs"", following a number of complaints. Asked about the investigation, Mr McDonnell told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I'm hoping we will get a clean bill of health about how we are handling things. ""If there are issues that the EHRC can advise us on, I welcome that. Because I want us to be a shining example of how you tackle issues like anti-Semitism, both within your own party, but also wider society. Mr McDonnell said he was hoping for a ""clean bill of health"" for the party ""Let's get it done, because we will all learn lessons from it and I hope that other political parties as well - in how they deal with the racism that they've experienced in their own party - learn from this too."" The Conservativeshave been accused of not tackling Islamophobiain the party by their own former party chairwoman, Baroness Warsi. Senior Labour figureshave clashed in the past weekover the way the backlog of complaints against Labour members is being dealt with, amid claims the process has become politicised. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, has asked that any complaints be forwarded to him for monitoring, saying that ""opacity and delay"" had led to a ""complete loss of trust"". But the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said that approach would undermine party processes. The Sunday Times has reported claims that two of Mr Corbyn's closest aides had intervened in the party's disciplinary processes to lift the suspension of an activist accused of anti-Semitism. The party said the report was based on a ""selective briefing"" from a former employee and said while for a few weeks staff in Labour's Governance and Legal Unit had sought advice on a handful of cases, that practice had been stopped when Ms Formby became general secretary ""and made the procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust"". It said there had been no attempts to overturn the unit's recommendations.

"The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday The Ethiopian Airlines tragedy marks the second fatal crash within five months involving a new type of Boeing aircraft. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has only been in commercial use since 2017. In October last year a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. That aircraft was less than three months old. Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 also went down just minutes after take-off.  The aircraft - registration ET-AVJ - first flew in October 2018, according to flight tracking websites. Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told the BBC the 737 Max's ""engine is a bit further forward and a bit higher in relation to the wing, compared to the previous version of the plane. That affects the balance of the plane"". The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced ""erroneous input"" from one of its sensors designed to alert pilots if the aeroplane is at risk of stalling. The inquiry has not yet reached any final conclusions about the cause of the disaster. The sensor and connected software work in a different way to previous models of the 737, but pilots had not been told that. Within days of the Lion Air crash, the aircraft maker Boeing issued an operations bulletin to airlines. The US aviation regulator then issued an ""emergency"" airworthiness directive to US carriers about this sensor - a so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor. The Federal Aviation Administration said the sensor ""condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain"". US airlines were told to update information flight manuals for air crew. At the time the FAA said the information was passed on to other national aviation regulators. The expectation was that regulators would inform airlines and they in turn would update pilots. Aviation sources say it almost certain that Ethiopian Airlines pilots would have been updated on the sensor issue. There is no immediate evidence to suggest the Ethiopia Airlines jet has encountered the same difficulties as the Lion Air flight. Aviation analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting told the BBC: ""There will be attention to the fact that this was a very new aircraft, the same type as that involved in the recent Lion Air accident and in a similar phase of flight - but detailed work taking time will be required to establish the cause."" In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said a ""technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board"". It has also said it extended its ""heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team"". The Boeing 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally. The initial findings of the investigation in Ethiopia will determine what action regulators and airlines take. Ethiopian Airlines is regarded as Africa's leading airline. Analyst John Strickland said it is ""also recognised globally as a high-quality professionally-run company"".

"Labour's John McDonnell has welcomed a potential investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in his party. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it is considering a formal inquiry following a number of complaints, including from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. The shadow chancellor told the BBC he wants Labour to be a ""shining example"" in the way it tackles anti-Semitism. He added: ""Let's get on with it now"". Jeremy Corbyn has said anti-Semitism has ""no place whatsoever"" in the party. Labour peers' 'alarm' at anti-Semitism row Labour could face human rights probe A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The Labour Party has been dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism over the last two years. On Friday, the chair of Labour peers wrote to party leader Mr Corbyn to express ""alarm"" at the ""ongoing failure"" to resolve the issue - something they said ""diminishes the moral authority of the Labour Party"". The EHRC is asking Labour to work with it to improve its processes.  It has raised concerns with the party, which has two weeks to respond before it decides whether to take enforcement action - which can range from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. The watchdog, which was set up by the Labour government in 2006, said it believed the party ""may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs"", following a number of complaints. Asked about the investigation, Mr McDonnell told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I'm hoping we will get a clean bill of health about how we are handling things. ""If there are issues that the EHRC can advise us on, I welcome that. Because I want us to be a shining example of how you tackle issues like anti-Semitism, both within your own party, but also wider society. Mr McDonnell said he was hoping for a ""clean bill of health"" for the party ""Let's get it done, because we will all learn lessons from it and I hope that other political parties as well - in how they deal with the racism that they've experienced in their own party - learn from this too."" The Conservativeshave been accused of not tackling Islamophobiain the party by their own former party chairwoman, Baroness Warsi. Senior Labour figureshave clashed in the past weekover the way the backlog of complaints against Labour members is being dealt with, amid claims the process has become politicised. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, has asked that any complaints be forwarded to him for monitoring, saying that ""opacity and delay"" had led to a ""complete loss of trust"". But the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said that approach would undermine party processes. The Sunday Times has reported claims that two of Mr Corbyn's closest aides had intervened in the party's disciplinary processes to lift the suspension of an activist accused of anti-Semitism. The party said the report was based on a ""selective briefing"" from a former employee and said while for a few weeks staff in Labour's Governance and Legal Unit had sought advice on a handful of cases, that practice had been stopped when Ms Formby became general secretary ""and made the procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust"". It said there had been no attempts to overturn the unit's recommendations.

"Stephen Hawking died in March last year Stephen Hawking's former nurse has been suspended and is facing a misconduct allegation over his care. Patricia Dowdy, 61, who worked for the renowned scientist for 15 years, was handed an interim suspension in 2016. A six-week Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing, which began in February and is due to last until 21 March, is being held behind closed doors in London. Mrs Dowdy told The Mail on Sunday,externalshe was upset and did not want to comment. Prof Hawking died at his home in Cambridge in March last year aged 76 having lived with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years. The alleged misconduct by Mrs Dowdy, from Ipswich in Suffolk, took place in Cambridge, according to the NMC's register of hearings. Director of fitness to practise at the nursing watchdog, Matthew McClelland, said its legislation and guidance was ""very clear that hearings will usually take place in public"". But he said that ""in some cases, including this particular case, there are reasons why this may not always happen"". This could be ""due to the health of those involved in the case, or that the allegations are related to a health condition of the nurse or midwife"", he added. This video can not be played A look back at the life of famous scientist Stephen Hawking Prof Hawking, who was known as one of the world's finest scientific minds, was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease in 1964 at the age of 22 and was given just a few years to live. But he continued to travel the world giving lectures and writing scientific papers about the basic laws that govern the universe. Prof Hawking explained the Big Bang and black holes in his best-selling book A Brief History Of Time - which has sold more than 10 million copies.

Hetold Devon Live,externalshe was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. ""Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about."" He said her job involved a lot of travel, but added: ""Personally, I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes. ""I'm an environmental campaigner myself - so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it's a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Toole paid tribute to her 15 years working in international animal welfare organisations: ""I'm very proud of what she achieved. It's just tragic that she couldn't carry on to further her career and achieve more."" ""She was very well known in her own line of business and we've had many tributes already paid to her,"" he added. He said he remembered when she was a small child she had tried to save badgers from being run over on a new road near her home. Ms Toole, who worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi.

They had a meal together and said goodbye before his father caught a flight to Addis Ababa, he said. ""I gave him a hug and shook his hand, because in my culture it's more about the handshake than it is about the hug,"" he told BBC News. ""And I said we'll probably see you at some point soon. We usually spend a bit more time saying goodbye, but yesterday it kind of just felt routine."" Michael Ryan worked for the World Food Programme Michael Ryan, from Ireland, was one of seven people from the UN's World Food Programme who died in the crash. The aid worker and engineer, known as Mick, was formerly from Lahinch in County Clare and is believed to have been married with two children.

The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday Ethiopian Airlines said it had contacted the families of all the victims, who came from 35 nations - including 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and eight Americans. At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board.

"A fire has destroyed an internationally-renowned bird observatory on Fair Isle in Shetland. Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, at about 11:20 on Sunday. Extra fire crews were flown in from Sumburgh by helicopter with others arriving on the island by boat. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the building had been ""lost to fire"", adding it was ""absolutely tragic news"". A family including two children who live in the flat adjoining the lodge were unhurt. There are no guests staying at the lodge for the winter season. Mr Dennis said: ""Thank goodness no loss of life but heartfelt sympathy to David, Susannah and family and the islanders. We will rebuild. We have lost much and will lose a year. Close to my heart - very very sad."" And Shetland MSP Tavish Scott described it as a ""colossal blow to the isle"". The smoke from the blaze could be seen for miles Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) recorded migration patterns One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. The fire is understood to have started in the roof. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. A statement on the Fair Isle Observatory & Guesthouse website said: ""A major fire has tragically destroyed the Obs."" A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Operations Control mobilised crews from Fair Isle and Shetland, with the crew from Lerwick transported via the Maritime Coastguard Agency's Search and Rescue helicopter. ""Further resources were later mobilised to help tackle the fire, with two crews transported from Shetland to Fair Isle with the assistance of the RNLI."" The observatory is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

Senior Labour figureshave clashed in the past weekover the way the backlog of complaints against Labour members is being dealt with, amid claims the process has become politicised. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, has asked that any complaints be forwarded to him for monitoring, saying that ""opacity and delay"" had led to a ""complete loss of trust"". But the party's general secretary, Jennie Formby, said that approach would undermine party processes. The Sunday Times has reported claims that two of Mr Corbyn's closest aides had intervened in the party's disciplinary processes to lift the suspension of an activist accused of anti-Semitism. The party said the report was based on a ""selective briefing"" from a former employee and said while for a few weeks staff in Labour's Governance and Legal Unit had sought advice on a handful of cases, that practice had been stopped when Ms Formby became general secretary ""and made the procedures for dealing with complaints about anti-Semitism more robust"". It said there had been no attempts to overturn the unit's recommendations.

"A fire has destroyed an internationally-renowned bird observatory on Fair Isle in Shetland. Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, at about 11:20 on Sunday. Extra fire crews were flown in from Sumburgh by helicopter with others arriving on the island by boat. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the building had been ""lost to fire"", adding it was ""absolutely tragic news"". A family including two children who live in the flat adjoining the lodge were unhurt. There are no guests staying at the lodge for the winter season. Mr Dennis said: ""Thank goodness no loss of life but heartfelt sympathy to David, Susannah and family and the islanders. We will rebuild. We have lost much and will lose a year. Close to my heart - very very sad."" And Shetland MSP Tavish Scott described it as a ""colossal blow to the isle"". The smoke from the blaze could be seen for miles Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) recorded migration patterns One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. The fire is understood to have started in the roof. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. A statement on the Fair Isle Observatory & Guesthouse website said: ""A major fire has tragically destroyed the Obs."" A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Operations Control mobilised crews from Fair Isle and Shetland, with the crew from Lerwick transported via the Maritime Coastguard Agency's Search and Rescue helicopter. ""Further resources were later mobilised to help tackle the fire, with two crews transported from Shetland to Fair Isle with the assistance of the RNLI."" The observatory is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

Tributes have also been paid to Kenyan and British dual national Joseph Waithaka and University of Plymouth graduate Sarah Auffret. The Foreign Office said at least seven Britons were among the dead.

Air disasters timeline Mr Toole said he last spoke to his daughter, who was from Exmouth but was living in Rome, on Friday evening. Hetold Devon Live,externalshe was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. ""Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about."" He said her job involved a lot of travel, but added: ""Personally, I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes. ""I'm an environmental campaigner myself - so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it's a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Toole paid tribute to her 15 years working in international animal welfare organisations: ""I'm very proud of what she achieved. It's just tragic that she couldn't carry on to further her career and achieve more."" ""She was very well known in her own line of business and we've had many tributes already paid to her,"" he added. He said he remembered when she was a small child she had tried to save badgers from being run over on a new road near her home. Ms Toole, who worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. The director of the FAO, Manuel Barange,tweeted,external: ""So profoundly sad and lost for words at the loss of our wonderful @FAOfish officer @JoannaToole"".

Her employers, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, said they were ""shocked and heartbroken"" to learn of her death. In a statement,external, released with the agreement of Ms Auffret's family, they said: ""Words cannot describe the sorrow and despair we feel. We have lost a true friend and beloved colleague.""

Joseph Waithaka was a father of three Joseph Waithaka - a 55-year-old Kenyan and British dual national - was also killed in the crash. His son, Ben Kuria said he was still in shock after hearing that his father, who moved to the UK in 2004, was on board the flight. Mr Kuria described him as a ""generous"" man who ""loved justice"". Father-of-three Mr Waithaka lived in Hull and worked for the Humberside Probation Trust before returning to live in Kenya in 2015. This video can not be played Son of Ethiopian Airlines passenger: ""I'm still in shock"" Mr Kuria said he had seen his father in Croydon, south London on Saturday, when he had been in the UK visiting relatives. They had a meal together and said goodbye before his father caught a flight to Addis Ababa, he said. ""I gave him a hug and shook his hand, because in my culture it's more about the handshake than it is about the hug,"" he told BBC News. ""And I said we'll probably see you at some point soon. We usually spend a bit more time saying goodbye, but yesterday it kind of just felt routine."" Michael Ryan worked for the World Food Programme Michael Ryan, from Ireland, was one of seven people from the UN's World Food Programme who died in the crash. The aid worker and engineer, known as Mick, was formerly from Lahinch in County Clare and is believed to have been married with two children. Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar said,externalMr Ryan was ""doing life-changing work in Africa"". The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday Ethiopian Airlines said it had contacted the families of all the victims, who came from 35 nations - including 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and eight Americans. At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said there were five Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft registered and operational in the UK, with a sixth due to enter operation this week. It said it was liaising with the European Aviation Safety Agency as information about the crash emerged. Meanwhile, two airlines that fly in and out of the UK and have the Boeing 737 Max 8 among their fleet said their aircraft were operating as normal.

"This video can not be played Clonduff camogie champions Two teams battle for more than 70 minutes. A whistle blows, a moment of disbelief, then one team explodes in ecstasy, the other collapses in despair. That's exactly what happened last Sunday as south Down camogie side Clonduff held on, just, to defeat Waterford club GailltÃ­r to win the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Club Championship final. The final score in Croke Park in Dublin was Clonduff 0-10, GailltÃ­r 0-09. Clonduff captain Paula Gribben was the hero, firing over six points to help the 'Yellas' win the title for the first time. Sara-Louise Carr popped over three points and her sister Fionnuala added the other score, a shot so impressive it went viral on Twitter. Their father, Ross Carr, a two times all-Ireland Gaelic football winner with Down, tweeted that Sunday was the ""greatest day"" of his life. But why did it mean so much? For Sara-Louise Carr, it was because the win brought ""so much happiness"" to the whole local community. Clonduff's ""dream came true"" with their win in Croke Park Paula Gribben says being the first Clonduff team to play in Croke Park made it a special and historical event with the team feeling the whole community willing them on. Clonduff remains bedecked in bunting, flags and posters in support of the team. The club fields no less than six sets of sisters - the Gribbens, (Karen and Paula), the Carrs (Fionnuala & Sara-Louise), the Fitzpatricks (Cassie & Beth), the McGilligans (Clare & Katie), the Wilsons (Lizzie & Hannah) and Livelys (Ellen & Erin). ""Win, lose or draw, you always have each others' back,"" Paula says of her sister Karen. ""When the final whistle blows, it's one of the first people you go to find."" Sara-Louise and Fionnuala acknowledge that they are competitive, but say they also advise each other. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Katie and Clare McGilligan are the daughters of club chair Guinevra and team manager Alastair, and are cousins of the Carr sisters. Being sisters just made the victory extra special, they say. They describe the experience as simply ""class"" with the community's reactions making the team feel like ""royalty"". Beth and Cassie Fitzpatrick say their feelings are indescribable, adding it was a very proud day for their parents and wider family. ""When the game was over and you looked up into the stand, men, women and children were crying, it was unbelievable."" This video can not be played Clonduff celebrate All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Club title Paula Gribben, reluctantly, admits that the camogie team has been more successful than Clonduff's male teams but was at pains to point out that all of the club's teams back each other. She acknowledges that her team are now role models. ""You're a player your whole life, you look up to other people and other people inspire you,"" Paula says. Allow Twitter content?

""You never think that you're going to be someone else's inspiration. ""But after Sunday, you realise we are role models for six, seven, eight year olds coming through. ""Success drives interest, I think with the success of this camogie, it will get a lot more families, a lot more girls involved,"" she says. Fionnuala Carr echoed those thoughts, saying that a player only has a short period of time on the pitch, and it was important to inspire a new generation. Orla Morgan, a Clonduff player for 27 years, missed out on the final due to a problem not encountered by male sports people. She found out she was eight-weeks pregnant four weeks after the Ulster final, ruling her out of contention. ""It's part of female sporting life,"" she says. Karen Gribben, who has three children, including a six-month-old, says pregnancy is a reality in women's sport, but that mothers can continue to play. The whole club is one big happy family, she says, but one of the first people she met on the pitch after the final whistle was her nine-year-old son Jimmy, who had run out looking for his mum. Clonduff Camogie club was first formed in 1951 but folded after a short time before reforming in 1967. It fields teams at all levels from under-sixes to to seniors. The level a team plays at club level is dictated by the level its county plays. Down play at Intermediate level and were in the All-Ireland Intermediate final in 2018 with 10 Clonduff players on the panel. The word camogie comes from the Irish camÃ³gaÃ­ocht and refers to the act of wielding the camogie stick, or hurl, 'the little bend'. The game is very similar to its male equivalent, hurling, and is considered one of Ireland's Gaelic games. Hurling has ancient origins and is closely related to its Scottish and Manx cousins, shinty and cammag. The modern game of camogie is regulated by the Camogie Association, founded in 1904. The consensus seems to be that 'three-in-a-row' is the now the team's aim. Although it is understood that the girls intend to take a ""few more weeks off"" to engage in some ""team-bonding"" activities. Clonduff GAA fields no less than 23 teams across hurling, Gaelic football and camogie as well as supporting the area's handballers. The village of Hilltown, the only one in Clonduff, has expanded rapidly in recent years but many of its young people still feel that a life overseas is a better option. Clonduff people and their descendents are found all over the world - many of whom follow and support their home club from afar. Clonduff also takes an active part in the GAA's cultural competition, the ScÃ³r. Local girl Aoife Trainor is currently the young All-Ireland champion in solo singing. She won the title singing 'SlÃ¡n Abhaile' (safe home) in memory of her six-year-old sister who died following a car crash near Newry in 2016. This video can not be played 'Legendary' Slaughtneil achievement is 'the stuff of dreams' Clonduff was not the only Ulster camogie team to win an All-Ireland title on Sunday. Slaughtneill, another club with huge importance to its community, won the senior championship. Tina Hannon hit 1-6 to secure Slaughtneill's third straight senior club title by defeating St Martin's 1-9 to 0-7 in the final. In 2016, Slaughtneil became the first club to win provincial titles in Gaelic football, hurling and camogie in the same year. The club did it again in 2017 with the senior teams clinching provincial success in all three codes.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tells Andrew Marr the Conservative party is ""in very perilous waters"" Conservative MPs should back Theresa May's deal this week or risk losing Brexit altogether, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned. There was ""wind in the sails"" of those opposing Brexit and the consequences for the party will be ""devastating"", if it is not delivered, he said. MPs will vote again on the deal on Tuesday, after rejecting it in January. Labour's John McDonnell said it looked like the PM had failed to secure any changes and it would be rejected again. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Minister rejects 'May should quit' reports SNP to ask for Indyref powers if UK leaves EU MPs will vote for a second time on Tuesday on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the European Union - after rejecting it by a historic margin in January. If they reject it again, they will get a vote on leaving without a deal, and if that fails, on delaying the exit date. Many Conservative Brexiteers voted against the deal in January over concerns about the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But there have been few visible signs of progress over the issue in continuing talks between EU and UK officials. Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show some MPs wanted to ""kill"" the deal, in order to delay Brexit, with the ultimate aim of getting another referendum on the issue. ""Within three weeks, those people could have two of those three things,"" he said, adding that Labour's position made the third more likely. He said: ""We are in very perilous waters, and people who want to make sure that we really do deliver this result need to remember that if it fails... they are going to say: 'There was a party that promised to deliver Brexit, we put them into No 10 and they failed', and the consequences for us as a party, would be devastating."" He added: ""We have an opportunity now to leave on March 29, or shortly thereafter. And it's very important that we grasp that opportunity because there is wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit."" If Parliament approves Mrs May's withdrawal agreement next week and the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, it will begin a transition period, when the two sides will attempt to agree a comprehensive trade deal. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the transition period, the ""backstop"" plan is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell: ""This is the mess the PM has got us into"" It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But some MPs fear that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. On Friday, Mrs May urged the EU to help her get the deal through by resolving concerns about the backstop. But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""It looks as though she's bringing back the same deal so it looks as though we will have the same result and it will be thrown out."" He said the party's priority this week would be to stop Theresa May ""driving through some sort of Brexit deal that will damage our economy and undermine jobs"" and if that meant a delay to allow for a discussion about the deal Labour backs instead ""so be it"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. He also denied that Labour's support for keeping the option of another referendum open had been put on the backburner, adding: ""If Parliament can't agree, if we have to break the logjam, yes, we will keep the option available of going back to the people."" And he said he believed that Labour's alternative Brexit deal could be agreed with the EU ""within a matter of weeks"" but said any delay requested should be ""as long as is necessary"". Labour's policy is to seek a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr McDonnell said the EU had ""looked positively"" on the proposal. On Friday, the EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances it has already made about the withdrawal deal and its chief negotiator Michel Barniertweeted,externalthat the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she was deeply disappointed by the EU's proposal, which has already been rejected by the UK government.

"SNP Westminster spokesman Ian Blackford MP spoke to BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland The SNP will ask for the power to hold an independence referendum if the UK leaves the EU. The party's Westminster spokesman Ian Blackford MP toldBBC's Sunday Politics Scotlandthe party would put forward an amendment this week asking for the power to hold a second vote. The people of Scotland should be able to ""determine their own destiny"" after the country voted to remain, he added. Jeremy Hunt said earlier the prime minister would refuse the request. However, Mr Blackford said that the Scottish Parliament has a mandate to hold an independence referendum and said that Theresa May should respect the sovereignty of the Scottish people. Brexit could be lost if deal rejected, Jeremy Hunt says Brexiteer MPs say delay would be political calamity One more push needed to get deal through, says May Mr Blackford continued: ""What we're going to do is put down an amendment asking for the government to recognise that Scotland voted to remain. ""We're also putting down as part of that amendment a recognition that if the UK does leave the European Union that the people of Scotland should be able to determine their own destiny and in particular should have that power to have an independence referendum if we so choose. ""We're making reference in that to the claim of right and the debate we had in Parliament in July 2018 that Parliament accepted the motion that sovereignty rests with the Scottish people. ""We will do what we can to work with other parties to stop Brexit, we have no desire to see Scotland dragged out against its will, but we need to recognise that if that does happen then the people of Scotland have got to determine their own future."" He added: ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit, we know that it's going to cost jobs, we know that it's going to impact living standards, we know of course that no deal is absolutely disastrous for the people of Scotland."" While the Scottish government could stage another vote on independence, a section 30 order transferring the powers needed to hold such a ballot from Westminster would be needed for it to be legally binding. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not hold a referendum without Westminster's permission. MPs will vote on the prime minister's EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday. Brexit: Does anyone really know what happens next? Theresa May has said that if the vote is lost that she will give MPs the chance to vote against leaving the EU with no-deal and to request an extension of the Article 50 withdrawal process, delaying the UK's 29 March departure date. Mr Blackford said that the SNP would vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit and extend the Article 50 process if the prime minister's vote on Tuesday is defeated. He also said that the party supports a so-called ""People's Vote"" on Brexit. A UK government spokesman said: ""Scotland had an independence referendum in 2014 and voted decisively to remain in the UK. ""The Scottish government needs to stop using Brexit as an excuse to pursue their unwanted independence agenda. ""Rather than constantly seeking division and constitutional upheaval, the Scottish government needs to work with the UK government to avoid a damaging no deal. That is what people and business in Scotland expect."" Brexit 'could be lost if deal rejected' Brexit: Who knows what happens next?

Two warnings for Scotland have been issued by the Met Office Another crash resulted in the closure of the A82 north of Tyndrum, near Crianlarich in Stirling. Police have warned of adverse weather conditions in the area. Motorists have been advised to take care across the country as weather experts warn of icy patches and potentially untreated roads. It is likely that journey times will be affected while bus and train services could face disruption. However, snow is unlikely to settle in lower areas. A Met Office report said: ""Widespread icy patches will develop on untreated surfaces Sunday evening and night. ""Wintry showers will also continue through Sunday evening and night onwards into Monday morning, especially over Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""Snow accumulations will tend to be largely confined to hills and mountains above 200-300 metres where a few centimetres of snow is possible. ""At lower-levels, any accumulations of snow will tend to be quite small and patchy in nature with most areas not seeing any snow settling.""

"Karen Watts & Martin Reijns were the first Scottish couple to have a humanist wedding Scottish couples who chose a humanist wedding are less likely to divorce than those who had other types of marriage ceremony, figures for the BBC suggest. Humanist weddings have been legal in Scotland since 2005 and are now more popular than Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic weddings combined. Marriage experts said divorce rates across the UK generally were declining. They said other factors could determine whether couples stayed together, such as age, wealth and shared values. The statistics, obtained from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) forBBC Radio 4's Sunday programme,reveal that since Humanist ceremonies began couples married in them are: Three times less likely to divorce than Roman Catholic marriages over the same period. More than two times less likely to divorce than Church of Scotland marriages. Almost four times less likely to divorce than civil marriages. In 2017-18, the last year full figures are available, there were 5,702 humanist marriages in Scotland. The traditional church wedding has been declining in popularity There were 3,166 Church of Scotland ceremonies and 1,182 Roman Catholic weddings. The most common type of wedding was a civil ceremony, of which there were 14,702. Scotland and Northern Ireland are the only parts of the UK where humanist weddings are legally recognised A humanist wedding is a non-religious ceremony to mark a marriage between two people. They are conducted by humanist celebrants and each service is different because the couple write their own vows and script. Humanist weddings have been legally recognised in Scotland since 2005 and in the Republic of Ireland since 2012. How humanists changed Scottish marriage Northern Ireland legally recognised humanist weddings last year after a Court of Appeal ruling said it would breach human rights not to do so. In England and Wales humanist ceremonies are permitted but do not carry legal recognition, meaning humanist couples must register their marriage civilly if they want to have a humanist wedding. In last autumn's Budget, the Treasury announced a review into relaxing the rules around wedding venues in England and Wales. The move could bring the law more into line with Scotland, where there is more freedom in where couples can tie the knot. Andy Murray and Kim Sears chose a Church of Scotland wedding at Dunblane Cathedral A breakdown of the figures shows that for marriages that have taken place in the past five years humanist weddings had a divorce rate of 1.7 in every 1,000, whereas civil ceremonies were 7.3. The Church of Scotland divorce rate for marriages less than five years old was 5.8 in 1,000 and for Roman Catholic weddings it was five. A similar pattern was found for couples married between five and 10 years and between 10 and 15 years. Harry Benson, research director at the Marriage Foundation said the figures were ""sensible"" but there are ""caveats"". ""It may be that humanists are older or richer than most, either of which would account for their apparently lower divorce rates,"" he told Radio 4's Sunday programme. ""However couples with a shared faith or worldview tend to do better, which might well also apply to humanist couples. And as social pressure to marry has reduced, divorce rates have been tumbling across the board as fewer couples 'slide' into marriage and more 'decide'."" Divorce rates have been declining across the UK The figures comes as a new poll by YouGov found that almost seven in 10 British adults support legally recognising humanist weddings in England and Wales. Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, said: ""These figures show what a good start for couples a humanist wedding can be. ""Humanist weddings are deeply personal, with a unique ceremony crafted for each couple by a celebrant that gets to know them well and ensures that their script and vows reflect precisely who they are and the commitment they are making to each other."" Rev Norman Smith, convener of the Mission and Discipleship Council, said the Church of Scotland's wedding services were also personal and denied the type of ceremony was a factor in divorce rates. ""There are many factors in marriage that affect divorce rates, including age, socio-economic status, children, and whether partners have been married before. ""Without understanding many of the variable factors affecting divorcing couples, any suggestion of causation between type of ceremony and divorce rate is entirely spurious."" A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Scotland claimed the ""fatal flaw"" in the statistics was that Humanist weddings had not been around long enough to draw meaningful conclusions. He said: ""The average length of marriages in Scotland is around 30 years. Humanist marriages have been available for around 13 years. It will be at least 17 years before we can determine whether humanist marriages last any longer than religious marriages. ""Clearly the Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland have been marrying couples throughout living memory, between them they have married hundreds of thousands of Scots. ""The Humanists by comparison have married around 30,000 Scots, an extremely small pool of potential divorcees compared with the churches and a statistically insignificant dataset upon which to base any meaningful conclusions.""

"Two pugs are recovering after being thrown from a car window near Wrexham People struggling to cope with their animals have been urged to seek help after two pugs were tossed from a car while at traffic lights. The RSPCA said the dogs' experience in Wrexham would have been ""scary and traumatic"". It said they were among 145 pets abandoned after Christmas, 92 of them dogs. The charity said animal abandonment was a problem and urged people to hand over unwanted pets to rescue centres. There are a number of reasons for people abandoning animals - with reasons including people growing bored of Christmas presents or dumping them in the summer rather than find care when they go on holiday. RSPCA Cymru superintendent Martyn Hubbard said: ""Tragically, many are carelessly abandoned, while others are advertised online and on social media with owners offering them 'free to a good home' or trying to cash in on their pet's worth. ""When owners are unable to cope, whether that be with an animal's behaviour, the costs of keeping the pet or other things in their life take over, they opt to dump them."" Greyhound Rescue Wales: Charity says hunting dogs being abandoned Ernie the spaniel: Newport woman's fight to keep Cardiff stray Stolen dog found in Bangor 300 miles from London home Inspector Rachael Davies said the pugs were now recovering after they were dumped on 20 February and one of them had been traced to owners in Essex. ""This would have been a very scary and traumatic experience for these two dogs,"" said ""Put simply, this is a disgusting way to treat animals."" One of the pugs has been traced to owners in Essex RSPCA figures show month-on-month calls about abandonments remaining consistent. In the past two years, there were increases in the numbers of dogs abandoned in January compared to December: from 91 to 112 in 2016/2017; 112 to 113 in 2017 to 2018; and 83 to 92 in 2018/2019. In January, RSPCA Cymru received the most calls (13) about dog abandonments in Cardiff, while there were nine in Torfaen and none in Vale of Glamorgan. All local authorities provide a dog warden service and it is their responsibility to round up stray dogs. RSPCA Cymru said it did not have the resources to pick up all healthy ones, but urged anyone finding a sick or injured stray to contact them. The spokeswoman said by law all dogs should be micro-chipped and have a collar with the owner's contact details, meaning it could then potentially reunite them. There were 129 calls to RSPCA Cymru about all animal abandonments in December this year and 145 in January.

"The wreckage was found 370m from the plane's last known position Indonesian investigators have released a preliminary report on the Lion Air flight JT610 that crashed on 29 October, killing 189 people. It details what is known by the authorities about the short time the Boeing 737 Max plane was in the air, but does not give a definitive cause for the accident. The full report is not expected until next year - but here's what we know so far. The air flight maintenance log showed six problems had been identified on the plane since 26 October, including errors with its airspeed and altitude information displays. The plane's angle-of-attack sensor - that measures the angle between the wings and the flow of air - encountered problems and was replaced the day before the crash. But,according to the preliminary report, problems continued.,external In the most recent flight before the crash, from Denpasar on Bali to Jakarta, the pilot issued a ""Pan Pan"" call - an urgency signal that is one level below ""Mayday"". The crew said that the aircraft was operating in abnormal conditions due to instrument failure. However, they managed to land the plane safely after requesting an uninterrupted descent, and the problems were logged. Victim's fiancÃ©e takes wedding photos alone Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple The preliminary report says that the stick shaker - a warning device that alerts flight crew when their plane is at risk of stalling - was active throughout the flight. This was an ""un-airworthy condition"" and the flight should not have continued, it said. JT610 departed from Jakarta airport on runway 25L, at 06:20 local time on 29 October / 23:20 GMT on 28 October. Both the pilot and co-pilot were experienced - the pilot had over 6,000 flying hours, while his second-in-command had more than 5,100 hours. According to the preliminary report, this is what happened after the plane took off. 23:21 GMT- The co-pilot asks an air traffic controller for confirmation of the plane's altitude on their radar display. The pilot then flags up that there is a ""flight control problem"". 23:22- The plane's automatic anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down for 10 seconds. The flight crew correct this by manually pointing the plane's nose up. 23:22- The co-pilot asks for the aircraft's ground speed as shown on the air traffic controller's radar display. 23:25- The anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down again, and crew correct this by pointing it up. This sequence continues for the rest of the flight. 23:29- The air traffic controller notices that the flight appears to be descending. The co-pilot says they have a flight control problem and are flying the plane manually. 23:30- The crew contact the airport's arrival controller, who tells them to prepare to land back on runway 25L. 23:31- The crew say they cannot determine the altitude of the plane, because all the aircraft instruments are indicating different altitudes. They ask the arrivals controller to block the air space 3,000 ft above and below them so they can avoid other traffic. The controller approves this request. 23:31- Contact with the plane is lost shortly afterwards. The plane's flight data recorder has been retrievedbut authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted. The wreckage was identified 370m (1,200ft) from the last recorded aircraft position, and the damage to the aircraft suggested a high energy impact, the report said. Investigators say it is too early to conclude what caused the crash. All 189 people on board lost their lives Nurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, told the BBC that ""several problems occurred simultaneously"" during the flight, including problems with measuring air speed and altitude, and with the stick shaker. There appeared to be particularly serious problems with the anti-stall system. Anti-stall systems prevent a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, during flight JT610, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. The report does not reach any conclusions. One of the victims' family are suing Boeing, and accuse the aircraft manufacturer of failing to inform the pilots of the new anti-stalling feature on its 737 Max plane system that could ""push the nose down unexpectedly"". Boeing has said that ""the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies"" and that ""the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement"" is contained in the relevant flight manuals. The correct procedures appeared to have been followed in the Denpasar flight before the crash, it said. However, Nurcahyo Utomo told the BBC: ""We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system."" If the automatic system kicked in and ""the pilot didn't know what was happening"", there was a risk it would confuse the pilots, he added. The report has recommended that Lion Air improve its safety culture, to enable pilots to make proper decisions - including deciding to discontinue a flight if the plane becomes un-airworthy. It also stressed that operational documents should be properly filled in - pointing out that the JT610 weight and balance sheet said five flight attendants were on board, when actually there were six. Budget airline Lion Air has in recent years risen to become a major player in South East Asia's low cost aviation sector. The airline, which also operates Batik Air and Wings Air, has a dubious safety record, though, and has had more accidents than other airlines in the country. Overall, Indonesia's aviation safety record has improved a lot since the days when even its national carrier Garuda was blacklisted from European and US airports over safety concerns.

"John McDonnell said nationalisation of the energy network and new investment could create thousands of jobs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has told Scottish Labour's conference that a ""green industrial revolution"" could create 50,000 jobs in Scotland. The MP told delegates in Dundee that Scotland could be ""at the heart"" of developments in renewable energy. And he said the governments in Edinburgh and London were not doing enough to tackle climate change. UK and Scottish party leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard addressed the conference on Friday and Saturday. Both leaders also addressed green issues in their speeches, with Mr Leonard setting out a vision of ""free bus travel for all"" and Mr Corbyn saying there was ""no bigger threat to our future"" than climate change. Leonard targets 'free bus travel for all' Corbyn makes plea for Labour unity Mr McDonnell told the conference that there needed to be better economic and environmental planning to ""tackle humanity's greatest challenge - climate change"". He said this would include nationalisation of the energy network, and an expansion of infrastructure and investment in energy generation in the Western Isles in particular. He said: ""Politicians of all parties have talked about the fourth industrial revolution. Under Labour, that will be a green industrial revolution. ""In the future, under Labour, Scotland will be at the heart of a green industrial revolution in our energy sector that could save the planet."" Mr McDonnell was speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee The Shadow Chancellor said Scottish hydro, wind and wave power were ""essential to achieving the transition to the sustainable fuel sources that we need"", and said the party's ""ambitious plans"" for developing these sectors could create tens of thousands of jobs. Hitting out at the dividends paid by energy companies in recent years, he said: ""Putting control of our energy sector in the hands of the public, with a mandate to cut through the short-sighted decision making of the privateers, can we unlock the true potential of Scottish energy."" In response, a Scottish Power spokeswoman said the firm ""supports thousands of jobs"" in Scotland, and have ""consistently invested and spent more in Scotland and the UK than we have made in profit or paid in dividends"". The Scottish Conservatives said Labour were ""out of ideas"" and ""seem to think that nationalisation will solve all problems"".

"Interserve runs employment workshops at HMP Berwyn in Wales Interserve is likely to go into administration on Friday. Directors of the company, that employs 45,000 people in the UK, have told the BBC the firm has ""a mountain to climb"" to prevent it collapsing under the weight of its nearly Â£650m in debt. A plan to swap the majority of that debt for new  shares requires the support of more than 50% of the shareholders and the company's biggest shareholder - US hedge fund Coltrane which owns 27% - is currently dead set against the plan. Since many small shareholders don't vote - even in a crisis like this - the support of Coltrane is seen as crucial in getting the deal through. The board's plan would see current shareholders awarded 5% of the company - with the rest going to the creditors. It is tempting to see Interserve as the next Carillion. An-overly indebted private provider of public services going to the wall after years of suicide bidding to win government contracts at the same time as paying out big salaries and dividends. While there are similarities, there are important differences. If the company collapses on Friday - this is what will happen. Accountants EY will be appointed administrators, they will then sell the company for a nominal amount to the current lenders (a mixture of banks and bond holders) who will own 100% of the new company. The banks would look to sell off different parts of Interserve's business in due course. The board does not expect any interruption to the company's underlying contracts or any immediate job losses. The real impact will be on the debate over the appropriateness of using big private sector contractors to carry out essential public service work. The government has been monitoring the Interserve situation closely and while it has felt unable to award a company close to collapse much new work, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy are comfortable services won't be interrupted. In fact, Interserve - minus its crippling debts - will arguably be in one of the strongest financial positions of any outsourcer. There may yet be a last-minute deal to save the company. It is after all a curious game of chicken. If Coltrane insists on blocking the deal - it will get zero rather than the teaspoon of value its being offered under the board's plan. The biggest loser - apart from the shareholders - will be the reputation of an outsourcing  business model that will doubtless once again become a political football.

"The Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the US, are fighting to clear Baghuz of militants The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have launched another assault on the Islamic State group's last enclave in Syria. Head of the SDF media office,Mustafa Bali, tweeted their troops were in ""direct violent clashes"",external. Islamic State militants are centred in the town of Baghuz in eastern Syria. Once the village is taken, the US and its allies are expected to formally declare the end of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. Exclusive pictures of final Islamic State group bastion Tales from inside the chaos left by IS After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Despite the loss of territory, the group is still seen as a major security threat capable of mounting attacks in the region and worldwide. The group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching across Syria and neighbouring Iraq, imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. After five years of fierce battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq. Sunday's attack began at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT), with air strikes aimed at weapons stores. SDF and coalition planes are involved in the assault, and the militant camp is now ablaze. But the SDF has said before that it had launched a ""final assault"". After intense air and artillery strikes on 1 March, the alliance said it had to slow down the offensive ""due to a small number of civilians held as human shields"". About 3,000 people were evacuated on Monday and another 3,500, including 500 militants who surrendered, followed on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a further 2,000 people left Baghuz, Reuters news agency reported. They were taken to an SDF checkpoint where they were searched, questioned and given food and water. Mr Bali told Reuters news agency no further civilians had come out of the town since Saturday. He also said more than 4,000 militants have surrendered in the past month. Five SDF fighters who had been held hostage by IS were also freed. But Mr Bali tweeted thatthe fate of other hostages remained unknown,external, including those of Italian priest Paolo Dall'Oglio and Lebanese journalist Samir Kassab. By Quentin Sommerville, BBC Middle East correspondent What's left of the Islamic State group enclave is an easy target - a couple of tented encampments surrounded on all sides and under regular bombardment from coalition warplanes. But the Kurds have taken an incremental approach. Attacking Baghuz and then calling ceasefires to allow IS supporters, hostages and children to leave. Sunday saw dozens of lorries arrive to evacuate more, but only a handful of people left. This might be the final assault, or it might be another ploy to again force people to leave. The fighting won't be easy. The Islamic State group has riddled the area with homemade explosives and still has plentiful supplies of ammunition and weapons. Clearing the last enclave could take days, if not longer. It is thought that the IS leadership has already fled. Despite losing nearly all the territory it once held across Iraq and Syria, experts still believe the group constitutes a major threat. US National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an interview on Sunday the group had fighters ""scattered still around Syria and Iraq and that [IS] itself is growing in other parts of the world"". US President Donald Trump has previously said Islamic State was defeated, but Mr Bolton clarified the president's statements. ""He has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of IS in total,"" he said. ""We know that's not the case."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The Worldwide Threat Assessment report,external, presented to the Senate in January, also highlighted the continuing dangers of the group. While IS will probably not immediately aim to take new territory, the report assesses its militants will try to ""exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term"".

"The MAX 8 series has only been operating commercially for less than a year Lion Air flight JT 610 has crashed into the sea, with nearly 190 people on board, shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. A lot of attention has focused on the fact the plane, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, was brand new. This is the first major incident involving that kind of plane. Details so far have been scant and the cause will not be confirmed until a full investigation has been carried out. Plane crashes are often the result of a combination of factors - both technical and human - but could the fact that the plane was so new have played any part? Images from the Lion Air plane crash How likely are you to survive a plane crash? The Boeing 737 MAX 8 has only been in commercial use since 2017. Budget carrier Lion Air said in July it was ""very proud"" to be the first in Indonesia to deploy the plane,,externaland that it had ordered as many as 218 units. The plane involved in Monday's incident has only been in operation since 15 August. It had logged only 800 hours of flight time, according to the head of the National Transportation Safety Commission, Soerjanto Tjahjano. The pilot is reported to have radioed air traffic control in Jakarta asking for permission to turn back, shortly after taking off. Now it has emerged that the plane had some technical problems on Sunday on its penultimate flight. A technical log obtained by the BBC for that flight - from Denpasar airport in Bali to Jakarta - suggests that the airspeed reading on the captain's instrument was unreliable, and the altitude readings differed on the captain's and first officer's instruments. As a result of the problem, the captain handed over control of the plane to the first officer, the crew continued their flight and they landed safely at Jakarta. Lion Air have not confirmed the report, but this may have been the unspecified ""technical problem"" that the company's chief executive said the plane's Denpasar to Jakarta flight had suffered from. Edward Sirait said that this problem had been ""resolved according to procedure"". He added that Lion Air was currently operating 11 aircraft of the same model. He said there were no plans to ground the rest of the planes. Aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told the BBC that usually it is old aircraft that are at the highest risk of accidents but that there can also be problems with very new ones. ""If it's very new there are sometimes snags that only reveal themselves after they are [used routinely],""  he said. ""These usually get sorted [within] the first three months."" The plane would have hit the three-month mark in just a few weeks. Another analyst, Jon Ostrower of aviation publication The Air Current, said there were ""always new teething issues... that's common, but a far cry from something that would threaten the safety of an aeroplane"". He added that new planes generally ""enjoy a maintenance holiday because everything is so new, not the reverse"". The world's worst air disasters Indonesia country profile Both analysts said it was too early to draw definitive conclusions about what had gone wrong with Flight JT 610. ""I don't know what would make a plane this new crash,"" Mr Ostrower told the BBC. ""There are so many different factors that can contribute to an accident like this."" Mr Soejatman said he believed it was ""likely to be technical issues that caused it but it's still very early days"". ""We can really [only determine the cause] when we get more information,"" he said. Indonesia's poor aviation safety record, though, has other experts believing that factors such as human error or poor oversight are more likely to be behind Monday's tragedy. Boeing has said it is ""deeply saddened"",externalby the loss of the plane. It sent its sympathies to the victims' families and said it would co-operate with the investigation. According to Boeing, the 737 MAX series is the fastest-selling plane in its history, and has accumulated almost 4,700 orders. The MAX 8 has been ordered by airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines, Norwegian and FlyDubai. Passenger plane crashes in sea off Jakarta Lion Air crash debris spotted in sea.

"The wreckage was found 370m from the plane's last known position Indonesian investigators have released a preliminary report on the Lion Air flight JT610 that crashed on 29 October, killing 189 people. It details what is known by the authorities about the short time the Boeing 737 Max plane was in the air, but does not give a definitive cause for the accident. The full report is not expected until next year - but here's what we know so far. The air flight maintenance log showed six problems had been identified on the plane since 26 October, including errors with its airspeed and altitude information displays. The plane's angle-of-attack sensor - that measures the angle between the wings and the flow of air - encountered problems and was replaced the day before the crash. But,according to the preliminary report, problems continued.,external In the most recent flight before the crash, from Denpasar on Bali to Jakarta, the pilot issued a ""Pan Pan"" call - an urgency signal that is one level below ""Mayday"". The crew said that the aircraft was operating in abnormal conditions due to instrument failure. However, they managed to land the plane safely after requesting an uninterrupted descent, and the problems were logged. Victim's fiancÃ©e takes wedding photos alone Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple The preliminary report says that the stick shaker - a warning device that alerts flight crew when their plane is at risk of stalling - was active throughout the flight. This was an ""un-airworthy condition"" and the flight should not have continued, it said. JT610 departed from Jakarta airport on runway 25L, at 06:20 local time on 29 October / 23:20 GMT on 28 October. Both the pilot and co-pilot were experienced - the pilot had over 6,000 flying hours, while his second-in-command had more than 5,100 hours. According to the preliminary report, this is what happened after the plane took off. 23:21 GMT- The co-pilot asks an air traffic controller for confirmation of the plane's altitude on their radar display. The pilot then flags up that there is a ""flight control problem"". 23:22- The plane's automatic anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down for 10 seconds. The flight crew correct this by manually pointing the plane's nose up. 23:22- The co-pilot asks for the aircraft's ground speed as shown on the air traffic controller's radar display. 23:25- The anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down again, and crew correct this by pointing it up. This sequence continues for the rest of the flight. 23:29- The air traffic controller notices that the flight appears to be descending. The co-pilot says they have a flight control problem and are flying the plane manually. 23:30- The crew contact the airport's arrival controller, who tells them to prepare to land back on runway 25L. 23:31- The crew say they cannot determine the altitude of the plane, because all the aircraft instruments are indicating different altitudes. They ask the arrivals controller to block the air space 3,000 ft above and below them so they can avoid other traffic. The controller approves this request. 23:31- Contact with the plane is lost shortly afterwards. The plane's flight data recorder has been retrievedbut authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted. The wreckage was identified 370m (1,200ft) from the last recorded aircraft position, and the damage to the aircraft suggested a high energy impact, the report said. Investigators say it is too early to conclude what caused the crash. All 189 people on board lost their lives Nurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, told the BBC that ""several problems occurred simultaneously"" during the flight, including problems with measuring air speed and altitude, and with the stick shaker. There appeared to be particularly serious problems with the anti-stall system. Anti-stall systems prevent a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, during flight JT610, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. The report does not reach any conclusions. One of the victims' family are suing Boeing, and accuse the aircraft manufacturer of failing to inform the pilots of the new anti-stalling feature on its 737 Max plane system that could ""push the nose down unexpectedly"". Boeing has said that ""the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies"" and that ""the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement"" is contained in the relevant flight manuals. The correct procedures appeared to have been followed in the Denpasar flight before the crash, it said. However, Nurcahyo Utomo told the BBC: ""We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system."" If the automatic system kicked in and ""the pilot didn't know what was happening"", there was a risk it would confuse the pilots, he added. The report has recommended that Lion Air improve its safety culture, to enable pilots to make proper decisions - including deciding to discontinue a flight if the plane becomes un-airworthy. It also stressed that operational documents should be properly filled in - pointing out that the JT610 weight and balance sheet said five flight attendants were on board, when actually there were six. Budget airline Lion Air has in recent years risen to become a major player in South East Asia's low cost aviation sector. The airline, which also operates Batik Air and Wings Air, has a dubious safety record, though, and has had more accidents than other airlines in the country. Overall, Indonesia's aviation safety record has improved a lot since the days when even its national carrier Garuda was blacklisted from European and US airports over safety concerns.

"This video can not be played Phoebe Waller-Bridge: ""So many potholes in the road"" for people with feminist values. The co-creator and star ofFleabagsays she worries about being labelled a ""bad feminist"" when writing the TV comedy. Phoebe Waller-Bridge told the BBC's Andrew Marr that there were ""so many potholes in the road"" for people with feminist values. And the dramatist, who is also behind the hit seriesKilling Eve, said audiences were ""exhausted by seeing women being brutalised on screen"". There was something ""oddly empowering"" about women being violent, she said. Fleabag is back - and she's found religion Fleabag: How to make people laugh by Phoebe Waller-Bridge Fleabag series two review Waller-Bridge has been lauded for her portrayal of a hapless, sex-obsessed and dry-witted protagonist in Fleabag. Asked by Andrew Marr if her ""voracious"" character in the show was the kind of person ""having fingers wagged against her by feminists"", she agreed. Waller-Bridge said: ""When I was first writing her, that felt like the most honest and frightening thing to put out there: Am I doing this right?"" At one point in the first episode of the programme, her character is asked if she would trade five years of her life for the ""perfect body"". She says she would and whispers to her sister: ""We're bad feminists."" Waller-Bridge said: ""You're not supposed to say those sorts of things."" At the time the show was created, Waller-Bridge said she wanted to live by feminist ideals, but also had ""bad thoughts"" and did things that appeared not to ""align with the message"". ""A lot of women - and probably some men as well - feel like they could fall into a trap of being a bad feminist, which is somebody who doesn't tick all the boxes of what it is to be a perfect feminist, or be a perfect spokeswoman for the cause,"" she said. ""There are so many potholes in the road. It's kind of frightening and you want to be able to say the right things."" Why so many young women 'aren't feminists' Meghan 'hopes baby will be a feminist' Waller-Bridge also spoke about the violence that featured in another of her shows, Killing Eve. The series, which is based on a thriller by British novelist Luke Jennings, was developed by Waller-Bridge for BBC America. It follows an MI5 officer as she tries to track down a female assassin and the obsessive relationship between the two women. ""People are slightly exhausted by seeing women being brutalised on screen,"" said Waller-Bridge. ""We're being allowed to see women on slabs the whole time and being beaten up. ""Seeing women be violent - the flipside of that - there's something instantly refreshing and oddly empowering."" But she said there was ""hardly any"" blood shown in Killing Eve. ""The challenge was to make it feel very violent without actually showing anything,"" she added. ""I think that's a very different experience for an audience.""

Two warnings for Scotland have been issued by the Met Office Another crash resulted in the closure of the A82 north of Tyndrum, near Crianlarich in Stirling. Police have warned of adverse weather conditions in the area. Motorists have been advised to take care across the country as weather experts warn of icy patches and potentially untreated roads. It is likely that journey times will be affected while bus and train services could face disruption. However, snow is unlikely to settle in lower areas. A Met Office report said: ""Widespread icy patches will develop on untreated surfaces Sunday evening and night. ""Wintry showers will also continue through Sunday evening and night onwards into Monday morning, especially over Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""Snow accumulations will tend to be largely confined to hills and mountains above 200-300 metres where a few centimetres of snow is possible. ""At lower-levels, any accumulations of snow will tend to be quite small and patchy in nature with most areas not seeing any snow settling.""

"Lorries have been driving through residential areas rather than following the designated route Villagers say they have been overrun by lorries travelling the wrong way to a new Amazon distribution centre. Signs have been put up on residential roads to warn HGVs they cannot use them to access the centre, on the site of Coventry's former Jaguar factory. One resident said it was ""an accident waiting to happen"". Amazon said it was aware ""a small number of Amazon-bound vehicles"" had taken the wrong route and asked people to record registration numbers. The 24-hour distribution centreopened in July last year on Lyons Park, employing more than 800 people. Coventry City Council has put signs up nearby Residents living around Allesley and Keresley said lorries had been cutting through on a daily basis. The designated route for lorries leaving the M6 is via junction four at Coleshill, following the A446 and joining the A45 to access the main Amazon entrance. But villagers said some lorries must be leaving the motorway at junctions two and three and passing through on a detour that can cut up to 20 miles off journeys. There are also fears for the safety of schoolchildren, with some lorries spotted mounting the kerb as pupils walk home. Lynda Hemsley, whose house backs on to the site in Browns Lane, said: ""I think there's a problem with sat-navs, postcodes, and they see Lyons Drive and think 'Oh, I'm there'."" Lynda Hemsley says she frequently sees lorries travelling the wrong way The site was home to Jaguar car production until it moved to Castle Bromwich in 2005. In a statement, Amazon said: ""Should any of our neighbours see an HGV in an area not designated for their use and believe it to be an Amazon-related vehicle, they should record the haulier name and registration number and supply it to Councillor Glenn Williams who has been working with us to identify any Amazon-related vehicles. ""All our suppliers are provided with route details to which they should adhere, and clear road signage is in place.""

"A total of 9,635 sheep were stolen in 2018, a Freedom of Information request revealed The theft of nearly 10,000 sheep across England and Wales last year has only resulted in one charge by police, the BBC can reveal. A Freedom of Information request showed 9,635 sheep were stolen in 2018, up from 7,606 in 2017 and 6,337 in 2016. Humberside saw the biggest jump in the number of sheep theft incidents in 2018, while Dorset and North Yorkshire had the joint second highest. Police in Dorset said there was a lack of resources to tackle rural crime. All 43 police forces across England and Wales responded to the BBC, giving details of 381 incidents of sheep theft last year. But Hertfordshire Police was the only force to bring a charge. Dorset Farmer John Hoskin says more sheep are being taken at one time A rural insurance company said it believed organised criminal gangs were stealing the animals for slaughter, with sheep fetching up to Â£90 each last year. John Hoskin, who runs a farm near Dorchester in Dorset, said sheep had regularly been taken from his fields and the numbers had gone up with each raid. Mr Hoskin said sheep theft had resulted in him losing between Â£40,000 and Â£50,000 in recent years, which had led him to question his future in farming. He said: ""Do we get rid of the sheep and say 'forget it, we're not going to provide illegal income for somebody else?'"" Dorset Police rural crime officer Tom Balchin said officers needed the public to help Dorset Police has two dedicated rural officers in the county. One of those, PCSO Tom Balchin, said a lack of resources to tackle the crime had been ""frustrating"" for him and the community. ""We're constrained to what we've got, and that's where we need the public to help us as well as people reporting things,"" he said. Tim Price, from NFU Mutual, which insures three quarters of UK farms, said a ""significant number"" of sheep had been stolen from farms that had not experienced thefts before, with cases of more than 100 animals being taken at once. ""It's organised gangs, they've got big vehicles, they've got the skills to round up sheep and take them away,"" he said. ""And very often they've got an outlet for them as well.""

"Dame Esther Rantzen has said her broadcasting career would not be as successful if she joined the industry now as a young woman because she would not be ""pretty enough"". The former That's Life! presenter and producer, 78, was a trailblazer for female broadcasters. The TV series, which began in 1973, regularly attracted 20 million viewers. Dame Esther told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs she was ""very lucky"" to have launched her career when she did. ""A few generations earlier, I don't think I could have done it,"" she told presenter Lauren Laverne. ""A few generations later, I wasn't nearly pretty enough."" She said it was ""taken for granted"" earlier in her career that she would not be promoted because of her sex. After getting her job on That's Life! she said she was conscious that ""women weren't given this responsibility before"". ""I was aware that if I didn't do a job well, preferably better than a man would, then I would make it much harder for the next generation of women,"" she said. The BBC One TV series featured light-hearted items alongside serious investigations, including reports on child abuse. Dame Esther with fellow That's Life! presenters Howard Leader, Kevin Devine, and Gavin Campbell in 1993 In 1986 Dame Esther set up Childline - a charity offering support to young people. She told Desert Island Discs the need for the counselling service - which has helped nearly five million children - is as great today as ever. When it started calls were mainly about ""horrible things people were doing to children, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, bullying"", she said. ""Now so much of it is about unhappiness, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders. And bullying has changed and become cyber bullying that you can't escape from."" Silver Line earns Esther a Damehood Esther Rantzen warns of social media 'pressure' on children Dame Esther also spoke about the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager, which she revealed for the first time in 2011. Speaking about her abuser she said: ""I can see him to this day. He used to call me 'bright eyes'. He had one of these creepy smiles and he took me out to buy me a present. ""He found a way of getting me alone and he sexually abused me, not the most serious assault but still horrible."" However, she said her ""lovely"" mother ""didn't really believe me"" when she told her about the abuse. ""My mum, like many parents, cared about the social circle she moved in, cared about not making problems, and in a way wanted me to carry on meeting him and I said, 'Under no circumstance.'"" She did not speak publicly about the abuse until long after she founded Childline. ""Whether I blocked it or whether I chose to forget it, is that the same thing maybe? ""It really didn't occur to me, even after we set up Childline, even after those children were talking to me about terrible things that had happened to them. But then someone asked me the question and the answer was, 'Yes I have been.'"" Dame Esther also set up The Silverline helpline for older people in 2013, after writing about loneliness following the death of her husband in 2000. Speaking about her marriage to Desmond Wilcox, who was married to someone else when they began their relationship, she said: ""Our marriage lasted and we have three wonderful children so I don't regret it.

"Italian PM Giuseppe Conte has criticised the tunnel despite support from his party's coalition partner, the League Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has put tenders on hold for a high-speed railway to France following political clashes over the project. The multibillion-euro TAV (Treno Alta VelocitÃ ) link has been criticised by the Five Star Movement, the biggest ruling party, but is backed by its coalition partner, the League. The impasse has raised talk of a government shutdown in Italy. It comes amiddiplomatic tensions with France over immigration. The TAV is a joint venture between Italy and France aiming to link Turin and Lyon via a 58km (36-mile) tunnel through the Alps. It is expected to halve the travel time between the two cities to just two hours. The tunnel would also make it possible to travel from Paris to Milan in around four hours, down from nearly seven. The tunnel from Turin to Lyon is expected to cost â¬8.6bn but an Italian government report put the price tag at over â¬20bn The project was launched 20 years ago and part of it has already been dug. It is scheduled for completion in 2025. Costs were initially projected to hit â¬8.6bn ($9.7bn; Â£7.4bn), but Italy's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli - a Five Star member - has put the price tag at over â¬20 billion. The EU first pledged to fund up to 40% of the cost, Italy up to 35% and France up to 25%. But on Friday, France's Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said the European Commission offered to increase its share to 50%, leaving France and Italy to cover 25% each. The rail line has been a continual source of contention within Italian politics. Supporters argue that it would take millions of cars and lorries off the road and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions in the region. But opponents say costs will be too high and the money would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. An Italian government report last month concluded that the tunnel would be ""very negatively profitable"" and lose â¬7bn by 2059. But the methodology of its findings has been criticised. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio and his party, Five Star, argue that money for the tunnel would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. Tensions escalated on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini - a member of the League - told television station Rete4 that he would continue to serve in the government coalition ""unless there are too many 'noes'"" over the tunnel and other infrastructure projects. Five Star leader and fellow Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio later hit back at Mr Salvini and accused him of acting irresponsibly by pushing for the tunnel. On Saturday, Mr Di Maio attempted to quell concerns about a government shutdown, saying in a Facebook post that the dispute was ""being resolved positively. So now let's talk about something else and move on."" Mr Salvini also said in an interview with news channel Sky TG24 that ""Italy needs a government ... there won't be a crisis."" Telt, the Franco-Italian company running the project, says it plans to go ahead with tunnel construction on the French side to avoid losing millions in EU funding. But it said it but wouldn't do so without the consent of both countries. The firm also said it would be adding a clause in the tenders protecting it from financial penalties if plans for the tunnel are revoked. Italy is now expected to hold further talks over the project with France and the EU. An EU official told news agency Reuters the project could lose up to â¬300m of EU funding if tenders are not launched by the end of March.

"Women may feel more relaxed and better able to cope with giving birth at home, the NHS says Midwives are trialling ""delivery bags"" to promote safe births at home.

Hywel Dda health board isthe only one in Wales selected for the Baby Lifeline,externaltrial due to its home birth rate and the large area it covers.

Sam was born by an emergency caesarean section after Ms Davies was induced at 42 weeks. ""I didn't really consider a home birth, but I did discuss the option briefly in the first trimester,"" she said. ""I was relaxed about most things, but I did consider what happens if the weather was bad and we wouldn't be able to make it in [to hospital] especially when I was overdue and came into the Christmas period, knowing resources would be limited."" In 2017, 3.9% of births in the board area were at home, compared to the Wales average of 2.4% (770 of 32,236 births). Powys' rate was 8%. Mums-to-be left 'high and dry' Woman gives birth to 15lb baby Catrin Davies with one-year-old son Sam and fiance Luke Palmer Jones The 32-year-old said many mothers-to-be were worried they would not receive as much support at home. ""The idea of a home birth scared me and still does,"" she said. ""If something went wrong you're adding time to what could be done, or a problem not being detected as quickly. ""One example is I attempted to breastfeed and I got support from the midwives in hospital based on my needs, not a timed slot with community midwives. ""I think, though, that many people could have a positive home birth if it was once again the norm."" Samantha Gadsden - who had two of her births at home - says ""any intervention increases the risk of another intervention"" Caerphilly-based doula Samantha Gadsden, who runs Home Birth Support Group UK and the South Wales Home Birth and Hopefuls Group, said birth was ""more pleasant at home"". ""Anything that interrupts the hormonal flow of birth can lead to changes in the birth. ""When you go from your own home where you're comfortable and safe to a hospital environment where you're bombarded with questions and it's bright and white, it's not a conducive environment for birth."" Ms Gadsden, who had two home births, said transfers to hospital were usually needed for more pain relief or labour was not progressing within specified timelines and ""life or death emergencies"" were rare. ""You have to spend the early part of your birth at home anyway and if you need intervention at home, the chances are you would have needed it at hospital."" Lynn Hurley, lead midwife for Hywel Dda, said the bags - which will be used from April - would promote a ""safe and high quality service"", and the aim was to eventually roll out the initiative across Wales. Judy Ledger, founder and chief executive of mother and baby charity Baby Lifeline, said: ""Frontline community midwives reiterated the same thing that nationally, there is no standardisation in what equipment is carried to community births. ""What's very important is that we've also developed the right processes to make sure the contents are replenished and kept up to date."" In England, 2.1% of women gave birth at home in 2017 compared with 2.4% in Wales - of 679,106 live births across both countries. The England figure for 2016 was the same, while Wales' had dropped slightly from 2.7%. Powys health board, which has the highest home birth rate in Wales, said women tend to see the same midwife throughout pregnancy helping to establish a good relationship to discuss birth options, and women can have antenatal appointments at home.

"Sir Cliff Richard has joined other public figures calling for the law to protect the anonymity of people suspected of sexual offences until they are actually charged with a crime. The star won a high-profile legal fight against the BBC after it aired live shots of police searching his home. He says he would never have been named as a subject of inquiry had the law protected him as an innocent party. The group wants to meet the home secretary to set out their case. Sir Cliff mounted a groundbreaking privacy case against the BBC last year over its coverage of the raid by South Yorkshire Police. The investigation - launched after police received what turned out to be false allegations of sexual assault - was subsequently dropped and police never arrested or charged Sir Cliff. The campaign group, calledFalsely Accused Individuals for Reform,external(Fair), was launched by two other personalities who had been falsely accused of sexual offences and named in the media - the presenter Paul Gambaccini and former MP Harvey Proctor. They argue it is time the law was changed to prevent innocent people being vilified in the media. Sir Cliff has now announced he is joining them. In a statement he said: ""Being falsely accused myself and having that exposed in the media was the worst thing that has happened to me in my entire life. ""Even though untrue, the stigma is almost impossible to eradicate. Hence the importance of Fair's campaign to change the law to provide for anonymity before charge in sexual allegations and hence my continued work with Fair in the future. ""Had this proposed change in the law been enacted when the police decided to raid my apartment following the allegations of a fantasist, the BBC would not have been able to film this event, name me, and so plunge my life and those close to me into fear and misery."" Victims of sexual offences have automatic lifetime anonymity from being named in the media - but there is no bar on news organisations naming anyone who is under investigation for any type of offence. There have been previous calls to prevent the media naming suspects before charge. The most recent debate came after a Sussex couple were arrested over last Christmas's Gatwick Airport drone disruption, named in the media, and then cleared of any wrongdoing. The government has refused to back a proposal from the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Paddick for all suspects to be protected from being named before they are charged, saying it would infringe on freedom of speech. But Daniel Janner QC, co-founder and secretary for Fair, said the campaign wanted to rebalance the scales of justice by focusing on a much narrower set of innocent individuals. Mr Janner's father, the former Labour MP Lord Janner,was charged with 22 sexual offences dating back to the 1960s, but was found unfit to stand trial days before he died in 2015. ""We're trying to get balance because it's with sexual allegations that mud sticks in the most awful way,"" said Mr Janner. ""And that is why we want the Home Office to enact a small but significant change in the law. It is a privilege and honour that Sir Cliff has added his support.""

"The wreckage was found 370m from the plane's last known position Indonesian investigators have released a preliminary report on the Lion Air flight JT610 that crashed on 29 October, killing 189 people. It details what is known by the authorities about the short time the Boeing 737 Max plane was in the air, but does not give a definitive cause for the accident. The full report is not expected until next year - but here's what we know so far. The air flight maintenance log showed six problems had been identified on the plane since 26 October, including errors with its airspeed and altitude information displays. The plane's angle-of-attack sensor - that measures the angle between the wings and the flow of air - encountered problems and was replaced the day before the crash. But,according to the preliminary report, problems continued.,external In the most recent flight before the crash, from Denpasar on Bali to Jakarta, the pilot issued a ""Pan Pan"" call - an urgency signal that is one level below ""Mayday"". The crew said that the aircraft was operating in abnormal conditions due to instrument failure. However, they managed to land the plane safely after requesting an uninterrupted descent, and the problems were logged. Victim's fiancÃ©e takes wedding photos alone Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple The preliminary report says that the stick shaker - a warning device that alerts flight crew when their plane is at risk of stalling - was active throughout the flight. This was an ""un-airworthy condition"" and the flight should not have continued, it said. JT610 departed from Jakarta airport on runway 25L, at 06:20 local time on 29 October / 23:20 GMT on 28 October. Both the pilot and co-pilot were experienced - the pilot had over 6,000 flying hours, while his second-in-command had more than 5,100 hours. According to the preliminary report, this is what happened after the plane took off. 23:21 GMT- The co-pilot asks an air traffic controller for confirmation of the plane's altitude on their radar display. The pilot then flags up that there is a ""flight control problem"". 23:22- The plane's automatic anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down for 10 seconds. The flight crew correct this by manually pointing the plane's nose up. 23:22- The co-pilot asks for the aircraft's ground speed as shown on the air traffic controller's radar display. 23:25- The anti-stalling system pushes the plane's nose down again, and crew correct this by pointing it up. This sequence continues for the rest of the flight. 23:29- The air traffic controller notices that the flight appears to be descending. The co-pilot says they have a flight control problem and are flying the plane manually. 23:30- The crew contact the airport's arrival controller, who tells them to prepare to land back on runway 25L. 23:31- The crew say they cannot determine the altitude of the plane, because all the aircraft instruments are indicating different altitudes. They ask the arrivals controller to block the air space 3,000 ft above and below them so they can avoid other traffic. The controller approves this request. 23:31- Contact with the plane is lost shortly afterwards. The plane's flight data recorder has been retrievedbut authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted. The wreckage was identified 370m (1,200ft) from the last recorded aircraft position, and the damage to the aircraft suggested a high energy impact, the report said. Investigators say it is too early to conclude what caused the crash. All 189 people on board lost their lives Nurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, told the BBC that ""several problems occurred simultaneously"" during the flight, including problems with measuring air speed and altitude, and with the stick shaker. There appeared to be particularly serious problems with the anti-stall system. Anti-stall systems prevent a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, during flight JT610, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. The report does not reach any conclusions. One of the victims' family are suing Boeing, and accuse the aircraft manufacturer of failing to inform the pilots of the new anti-stalling feature on its 737 Max plane system that could ""push the nose down unexpectedly"". Boeing has said that ""the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies"" and that ""the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement"" is contained in the relevant flight manuals. The correct procedures appeared to have been followed in the Denpasar flight before the crash, it said. However, Nurcahyo Utomo told the BBC: ""We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system."" If the automatic system kicked in and ""the pilot didn't know what was happening"", there was a risk it would confuse the pilots, he added. The report has recommended that Lion Air improve its safety culture, to enable pilots to make proper decisions - including deciding to discontinue a flight if the plane becomes un-airworthy. It also stressed that operational documents should be properly filled in - pointing out that the JT610 weight and balance sheet said five flight attendants were on board, when actually there were six. Budget airline Lion Air has in recent years risen to become a major player in South East Asia's low cost aviation sector. The airline, which also operates Batik Air and Wings Air, has a dubious safety record, though, and has had more accidents than other airlines in the country. Overall, Indonesia's aviation safety record has improved a lot since the days when even its national carrier Garuda was blacklisted from European and US airports over safety concerns.

"Italian PM Giuseppe Conte has criticised the tunnel despite support from his party's coalition partner, the League Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has put tenders on hold for a high-speed railway to France following political clashes over the project. The multibillion-euro TAV (Treno Alta VelocitÃ ) link has been criticised by the Five Star Movement, the biggest ruling party, but is backed by its coalition partner, the League. The impasse has raised talk of a government shutdown in Italy. It comes amiddiplomatic tensions with France over immigration. The TAV is a joint venture between Italy and France aiming to link Turin and Lyon via a 58km (36-mile) tunnel through the Alps. It is expected to halve the travel time between the two cities to just two hours. The tunnel would also make it possible to travel from Paris to Milan in around four hours, down from nearly seven. The tunnel from Turin to Lyon is expected to cost â¬8.6bn but an Italian government report put the price tag at over â¬20bn The project was launched 20 years ago and part of it has already been dug. It is scheduled for completion in 2025. Costs were initially projected to hit â¬8.6bn ($9.7bn; Â£7.4bn), but Italy's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli - a Five Star member - has put the price tag at over â¬20 billion. The EU first pledged to fund up to 40% of the cost, Italy up to 35% and France up to 25%. But on Friday, France's Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said the European Commission offered to increase its share to 50%, leaving France and Italy to cover 25% each. The rail line has been a continual source of contention within Italian politics. Supporters argue that it would take millions of cars and lorries off the road and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions in the region. But opponents say costs will be too high and the money would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. An Italian government report last month concluded that the tunnel would be ""very negatively profitable"" and lose â¬7bn by 2059. But the methodology of its findings has been criticised. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio and his party, Five Star, argue that money for the tunnel would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. Tensions escalated on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini - a member of the League - told television station Rete4 that he would continue to serve in the government coalition ""unless there are too many 'noes'"" over the tunnel and other infrastructure projects. Five Star leader and fellow Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio later hit back at Mr Salvini and accused him of acting irresponsibly by pushing for the tunnel. On Saturday, Mr Di Maio attempted to quell concerns about a government shutdown, saying in a Facebook post that the dispute was ""being resolved positively. So now let's talk about something else and move on."" Mr Salvini also said in an interview with news channel Sky TG24 that ""Italy needs a government ... there won't be a crisis."" Telt, the Franco-Italian company running the project, says it plans to go ahead with tunnel construction on the French side to avoid losing millions in EU funding. But it said it but wouldn't do so without the consent of both countries. The firm also said it would be adding a clause in the tenders protecting it from financial penalties if plans for the tunnel are revoked. Italy is now expected to hold further talks over the project with France and the EU.

"Two leading Brexiteers have said any delay to Brexit would do ""incalculable"" harm to public trust in politics. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Tory MP Steve Baker and the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the ""extended uncertainty"" would be a ""political calamity"". On Tuesday, Theresa May will again ask MPs to back her Brexit deal, but if they reject it they may get a chance to vote to delay Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Analysis: What happens next? Mr Baker, who is deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group (ERG), and Mr Dodds wrote that, for some, any delay would mean ""democracy would be effectively dead"". They said that such an outcome would be ""a costly delay for businesses which have prepared to exit on 29 March"". Both were confident that without changes to the deal, Mrs May would be ""defeated firmly"" again on Tuesday. Please upgrade your browser MPsrejected the prime minister's dealby 230 votes in January - the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. If they do the same this week, MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal. If they then reject a no-deal Brexit they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Speaking on Sky News, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""A delay or extension of about three months is probably doable. Beyond that it becomes much more difficult."" He added that Labour's front bench would not put down an amendment to secure another referendum, ahead of the vote on Mrs May's deal on Tuesday. He said any such amendment should come from a backbencher in order to get more widespread support from MPs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the same programme it was not inevitable that the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU would be rejected on Tuesday. He added: ""It's in the gift of MPs to get on and deliver on Brexit and I very much hope that that is what people will vote for."" Since January, the prime minister has been trying to seek assurances from the EU about the so-called Irish backstop - an aspect of her plan which is a sticking point for many MPs. If Parliament approves Mrs May's withdrawal agreement, and the UK leaves the EU on 29 March,it will begin a transition period, when the two sides will attempt to agree a comprehensive trade deal. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the transition period, the backstop is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit's border drama nears final act But some MPs fear that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. They want Mrs May to change this aspect of the deal. Discussions between the UK government and EU officials on how to resolve the problem continued over the weekend. On Friday, Mrs May said the UK had put forward ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock. The EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Its Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of the EU's latest proposal. Meanwhile the US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, has urged the British public not to let the ""distraction"" ofthe debate over food standards and chlorine-washed chickenblock the ""huge opportunity"" of a trade deal between the countries. He said the US was the world's largest food importer, but currently bought less than one per cent of its food from the UK. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, he said: ""It's time to move on from chlorinated chicken. It's just a bogeyman used to scare you out of doing a great trade deal with America that will give your businesses a huge competitive advantage.""

"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" It was too dangerous to send British officials to rescue Shamima Begum's baby son in Syria, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. The child died in a refugee camp after his mother, who joined IS in 2015, was stripped of UK citizenship. The boy was a UK citizen - but Mr Hunt told the BBC that any rescuers' lives would have been at risk in the camp. ""The mother chose to leave a free country to join a terrorist organisation,"" he said. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the foreign secretary confirmed that Jarrah, who was three weeks old, was a British citizen even though his mother was not. But he said that - although several journalists had reached the camp and spoken to Ms Begum - ""we have to think about the safety of the British officials that I would send into that warzone"". ""Shamima knew when she made the decision to join Daesh, she was going into a country where there was no embassy, there was no consular assistance, and I'm afraid those decisions, awful though it is, they do have consequences,"" he said. He said that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development were looking at ways to find the British children of other so-called ""Islamic State brides"" and get them out. This video can not be played Ahmed Ali on his daughter Shamima Begum: ""She has done wrong, whether or not she realised it"" Details have emerged of two more women from the UK, who are in Syrian camps with their young children, who have been stripped of their citizenship. Reema Iqbal and her sister, Zara, from east London, were firstnamed by The Sunday Times,external, quoting legal sources. Sources told the BBC that the decision to remove their citizenship was taken by the former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who left office in April 2018. The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases. Decisions to withdraw citizenship from individuals were evidence-based and not taken lightly, it added. The use of the powers has risen sharply, with 104 deprivations of citizenship in 2017, compared to 50 in the previous decade, according to Home Officefigures obtained by the immigration law website Free Movement,external. Many cases have involved national security and supporters of groups such as Al-Qaeda butcriminals - including three of the Rochdale grooming gang -have also been stripped of citizenship. The Sunday Times says that Reema, 30, and Zara, 28, are living in separate refugee camps in Syria - along with thousands of other families who have fled from territory formerly controlled by jihadis. Between them they have five boys under the age of eight, it says. The parents of the sisters are originally from Pakistan, but it is not known if they have dual nationality. I apologise to Britain, says Shamima Begum's dad What was life like for Shamima Begum? According to the Sunday Times, the sisters left for Syria in 2013 after marrying IS fighters with ""close links"" to the filmed murders of western hostages. Zara was heavily pregnant with her second child when she travelled to Syria and later gave birth to a third. Reema has one son born in the UK and another born in Syria. Home Secretary Sajid Javid hasfaced criticismfor his handling of the similar case of Ms Begum. Her three-week-old son, Jarrah, died of pneumonia on Thursday, according to a medical certificate. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the child had died as a result of the ""callous and inhumane"" decision to strip Ms Begum of her citizenship - while Tory MP and former justice minister Phillip Lee urged the government to ""reflect"" on its ""moral responsibility"" for the tragedy. A UK government spokesman said: ""The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family.""

"President Maduro told supporters to celebrate ""anti-imperialism day"" Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has praised the armed forces for staying loyal to him and defeating a ""coup"" led by the US and opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³. During a rally, Mr Maduro also blamed Venezuela's widespread power cuts on ""cyber attacks"" by the opposition. His remarks came during a day of protests in the country by pro-government and opposition groups. In the capital Caracas, some supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ scuffled with police. Mr Maduro has retained the support of the military and close allies including Russia and China since Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president on 23 January. Speaking outside the Miraflores presidential palace, Mr Maduro referred to Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""a clown and a puppet"" of the US. ""They invited the armed forces to carry out a military coup and their reply was clear - they have defeated the coup plotters,"" he said. President Maduro has repeatedly accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"" Meanwhile, police were out in force during an opposition march in the city. Some protesters pushed against police in riot gear shouting ""murderers"" and officers responded by firing pepper spray at them. This video can not be played Protesters tried to push back lines of riot police in Caracas Addressing the rally, Mr GuaidÃ³ announced he would embark on a tour of the country and summon all his supporters to attend a mass protest in Caracas ""very soon"". ""We are going to come, all of Venezuela to Caracas, because we need all of them united,"" he said. Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries. Juan GuaidÃ³ told supporters to keep up pressure on the government President Maduro has repeatedly accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"". Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. By Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas At the end of what had been one of Venezuela's more fraught days of the recent period of political upheaval, the lights went out again. Caracas was plunged back into darkness with the vast majority of the city still without power. Issues are being reported from other cities elsewhere in the country too. President Maduro had used his demonstration to thank the military for their role in holding off what he described as an attempted coup as he continued to insist the blackout is part of a US plan for his downfall. Elsewhere, supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ cited the power cut as just one of the reasons they want him gone, and soon. Yet that is unlikely to happen overnight, even with widespread blackouts across the country. For now, Mr GuaidÃ³ intends to travel the nation to drum up support and then hold another huge march in Caracas. Ahead may lie more demonstrations, more attempts to bring in humanitarian aid against the government's will, more potential for clashes. In the meantime, Venezuela is fast becoming ungovernable, with two men claiming legitimacy as president and a population caught in the middle, growing increasingly desperate for the return of electricity and basic services. The widespread power cuts since Thursday have reportedly been caused by problems at the Guri hydroelectric plant in Bolivar state - one of the largest such facilities in Latin America. A fresh blackout struck on Saturday, El Nacional newspaper reported, cutting power to many areas where it had previously been restored. In Caracas, traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness President Maduro said on Saturday that electrical substations had been under cyber attack with ""the support and assistance of the US"". He told supporters that almost 70% of power had been restored but at midday there was another ""attack at one of the generators that was working perfectly and that disturbed and undid everything we had achieved."" ""We have evidence and they will be held accountable,"" the Venezuelan premier added. ""We will also introduce new measures to protect our electrical system from hackers."" Mr GuaidÃ³ has blamed the blackouts on years of under-investment. On Friday, some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators. In pictures: Lights go out on Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Is there a cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela's exodus In Caracas's University Hospital, 25-year-old patient Marielsi Aray died after her respirator stopped working. ""The doctors tried to help her by pumping manually, they did everything they could, but with no electricity, what were they to do?"" said her uncle Jose Lugo. Generators at a Caracas children's hospital failed, with staff reportedly working overnight using their mobile phones for light. Thousands join rival Venezuela rallies Police clash with protesters.

Police said Lionel Simenya had been involved in an altercation anddied of his injuries in Fords Road in the city's Saughton areaon Thursday. Mr Simenya was originally from Burundi but had lived in the UK for some years.

"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan. Opponents say it would not end the free movement of people or allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.

"Dissent is not a choice North Koreans are voting to elect the country's rubber-stamp parliament, the second such election since Kim Jong-un took power. Voting for the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) is mandatory and there's no choice of candidates. Any kind of dissent is unheard of. Turnout is always close to 100% and approval for the governing alliance is unanimous. North Korea is an isolated state, ruled by the Kim family dynasty. Citizens are required to show complete devotion to the family and its current leader. On election day, the entire population aged 17 or older must come out and vote. ""As a sign of loyalty you're expected to turn up early, that means there'll likely be long queues,"" says North Korea analyst Fyodor Tertitskiy, who is based in the South Korean capital Seoul. Once it's your turn, you receive a ballot paper with just one name on it. There's nothing to fill in, no boxes to tick. You take that paper and put it into the ballot box, which is located in the open. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis In pictures: Growing up in North Korea There's also a voting booth where you could vote in private, but doing that would raise immediate suspicion, analysts say. You theoretically have the right to cross out that single candidate. But, according to Mr Tertitskiy, doing that would almost certainly mean the secret police go after you and you likely would be declared insane. Cheering is a key skill needed at all kinds of events in North Korea Once you leave the polling station, you are expected to join the cheering groups outside to express your happiness about having been able to cast your vote for the wise leadership of the country. ""In state media, election days are portrayed as festive events, with people outside each polling station celebrating,"" explains Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News - a North Korea specialist news website. Because voting is obligatory, the election also works as a census for authorities to monitor the population of each constituency and to track defectors who might have fled to China. The Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) is a rubber-stamp body with no power. Elected every five years, the parliament is the only legislative body North Korea has. ""I know that international media often hedge their reporting a bit, saying the SPA has 'little' power or influence - but that's not correct. It has zero,"" said Mr Tertitskiy. Laws are in fact written by the party apparatus and then merely approved by the SPA as a formality. Imagine a North Korean family... What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Theoretically, parliament could remove Mr Kim from power That's a far cry from the far-reaching powers that, in theory, it does have. A two-thirds majority would be enough to change the constitution and a mere simple majority could remove Kim Jong-un from power. In fact, the SPA doesn't even meet regularly. In its first meeting, it elects a much smaller body to work in its stead and then the original assembly only comes together on rare occasions. You might assume there's only one single party, but surprisingly, there are actually three different factions in parliament. Every North Korean above the age of 17 is obliged to vote The Workers Party, of which Kim Jong-un is the chairman, is by far the biggest but a few seats are usually held by two other parties, the Social Democratic party and the Chondoist Chongu party. In practice, there is no difference between the three parties and they're all grouped together in the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea. The result is not much of a nail biter, but it will take a few days before the final numbers are announced. First, there's usually an announcement of the impressive turnout. In 2014, that number stood at 99.97%. A few people might not have voted due to illness - though a running joke is that on election day no one dies and everyone is in good health. The next step is that the numbers of Kim Jong-un's constituency are released, both turnout and political support are usually 100%. Finally, the results for the other constituencies will be released. While turnout might be a few percentage points lower, political support for the candidate in each constituency is again bound to be 100%, if previous years are any indication.

"Italian PM Giuseppe Conte has criticised the tunnel despite support from his party's coalition partner, the League Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has put tenders on hold for a high-speed railway to France following political clashes over the project. The multibillion-euro TAV (Treno Alta VelocitÃ ) link has been criticised by the Five Star Movement, the biggest ruling party, but is backed by its coalition partner, the League. The impasse has raised talk of a government shutdown in Italy. It comes amiddiplomatic tensions with France over immigration. The TAV is a joint venture between Italy and France aiming to link Turin and Lyon via a 58km (36-mile) tunnel through the Alps. It is expected to halve the travel time between the two cities to just two hours. The tunnel would also make it possible to travel from Paris to Milan in around four hours, down from nearly seven. The tunnel from Turin to Lyon is expected to cost â¬8.6bn but an Italian government report put the price tag at over â¬20bn The project was launched 20 years ago and part of it has already been dug. It is scheduled for completion in 2025. Costs were initially projected to hit â¬8.6bn ($9.7bn; Â£7.4bn), but Italy's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli - a Five Star member - has put the price tag at over â¬20 billion. The EU first pledged to fund up to 40% of the cost, Italy up to 35% and France up to 25%. But on Friday, France's Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said the European Commission offered to increase its share to 50%, leaving France and Italy to cover 25% each. The rail line has been a continual source of contention within Italian politics. Supporters argue that it would take millions of cars and lorries off the road and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions in the region. But opponents say costs will be too high and the money would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. An Italian government report last month concluded that the tunnel would be ""very negatively profitable"" and lose â¬7bn by 2059. But the methodology of its findings has been criticised. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio and his party, Five Star, argue that money for the tunnel would be better spent on upgrading existing roads and bridges. Tensions escalated on Thursday after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini - a member of the League - told television station Rete4 that he would continue to serve in the government coalition ""unless there are too many 'noes'"" over the tunnel and other infrastructure projects. Five Star leader and fellow Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio later hit back at Mr Salvini and accused him of acting irresponsibly by pushing for the tunnel. On Saturday, Mr Di Maio attempted to quell concerns about a government shutdown, saying in a Facebook post that the dispute was ""being resolved positively. So now let's talk about something else and move on."" Mr Salvini also said in an interview with news channel Sky TG24 that ""Italy needs a government ... there won't be a crisis."" Telt, the Franco-Italian company running the project, says it plans to go ahead with tunnel construction on the French side to avoid losing millions in EU funding. But it said it but wouldn't do so without the consent of both countries. The firm also said it would be adding a clause in the tenders protecting it from financial penalties if plans for the tunnel are revoked. Italy is now expected to hold further talks over the project with France and the EU. An EU official told news agency Reuters the project could lose up to â¬300m of EU funding if tenders are not launched by the end of March.

"President Maduro told supporters to celebrate ""anti-imperialism day"" Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has praised the armed forces for staying loyal to him and defeating a ""coup"" led by the US and opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³. During a rally, Mr Maduro also blamed Venezuela's widespread power cuts on ""cyber attacks"" by the opposition. His remarks came during a day of protests in the country by pro-government and opposition groups. In the capital Caracas, some supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ scuffled with police. Mr Maduro has retained the support of the military and close allies including Russia and China since Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president on 23 January. Speaking outside the Miraflores presidential palace, Mr Maduro referred to Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""a clown and a puppet"" of the US. ""They invited the armed forces to carry out a military coup and their reply was clear - they have defeated the coup plotters,"" he said. President Maduro has repeatedly accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"" Meanwhile, police were out in force during an opposition march in the city. Some protesters pushed against police in riot gear shouting ""murderers"" and officers responded by firing pepper spray at them. This video can not be played Protesters tried to push back lines of riot police in Caracas Addressing the rally, Mr GuaidÃ³ announced he would embark on a tour of the country and summon all his supporters to attend a mass protest in Caracas ""very soon"". ""We are going to come, all of Venezuela to Caracas, because we need all of them united,"" he said. Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries. Juan GuaidÃ³ told supporters to keep up pressure on the government President Maduro has repeatedly accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"". Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. By Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas At the end of what had been one of Venezuela's more fraught days of the recent period of political upheaval, the lights went out again. Caracas was plunged back into darkness with the vast majority of the city still without power. Issues are being reported from other cities elsewhere in the country too. President Maduro had used his demonstration to thank the military for their role in holding off what he described as an attempted coup as he continued to insist the blackout is part of a US plan for his downfall. Elsewhere, supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ cited the power cut as just one of the reasons they want him gone, and soon. Yet that is unlikely to happen overnight, even with widespread blackouts across the country. For now, Mr GuaidÃ³ intends to travel the nation to drum up support and then hold another huge march in Caracas. Ahead may lie more demonstrations, more attempts to bring in humanitarian aid against the government's will, more potential for clashes. In the meantime, Venezuela is fast becoming ungovernable, with two men claiming legitimacy as president and a population caught in the middle, growing increasingly desperate for the return of electricity and basic services. The widespread power cuts since Thursday have reportedly been caused by problems at the Guri hydroelectric plant in Bolivar state - one of the largest such facilities in Latin America. A fresh blackout struck on Saturday, El Nacional newspaper reported, cutting power to many areas where it had previously been restored. In Caracas, traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness President Maduro said on Saturday that electrical substations had been under cyber attack with ""the support and assistance of the US"". He told supporters that almost 70% of power had been restored but at midday there was another ""attack at one of the generators that was working perfectly and that disturbed and undid everything we had achieved."" ""We have evidence and they will be held accountable,"" the Venezuelan premier added. ""We will also introduce new measures to protect our electrical system from hackers."" Mr GuaidÃ³ has blamed the blackouts on years of under-investment. On Friday, some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Two leading Brexiteers have said any delay to Brexit would do ""incalculable"" harm to public trust in politics. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Tory MP Steve Baker and the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the ""extended uncertainty"" would be a ""political calamity"". On Tuesday, Theresa May will again ask MPs to back her Brexit deal, but if they reject it they may get a chance to vote to delay Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Analysis: What happens next? Mr Baker, who is deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group (ERG), and Mr Dodds wrote that, for some, any delay would mean ""democracy would be effectively dead"". They said that such an outcome would be ""a costly delay for businesses which have prepared to exit on 29 March"". Both were confident that without changes to the deal, Mrs May would be ""defeated firmly"" again on Tuesday. Please upgrade your browser MPsrejected the prime minister's dealby 230 votes in January - the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. If they do the same this week, MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal. If they then reject a no-deal Brexit they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Speaking on Sky News, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""A delay or extension of about three months is probably doable. Beyond that it becomes much more difficult."" He added that Labour's front bench would not put down an amendment to secure another referendum, ahead of the vote on Mrs May's deal on Tuesday. He said any such amendment should come from a backbencher in order to get more widespread support from MPs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the same programme it was not inevitable that the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU would be rejected on Tuesday. He added: ""It's in the gift of MPs to get on and deliver on Brexit and I very much hope that that is what people will vote for."" Since January, the prime minister has been trying to seek assurances from the EU about the so-called Irish backstop - an aspect of her plan which is a sticking point for many MPs. If Parliament approves Mrs May's withdrawal agreement, and the UK leaves the EU on 29 March,it will begin a transition period, when the two sides will attempt to agree a comprehensive trade deal. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the transition period, the backstop is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit's border drama nears final act But some MPs fear that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. They want Mrs May to change this aspect of the deal. Discussions between the UK government and EU officials on how to resolve the problem continued over the weekend. On Friday, Mrs May said the UK had put forward ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock. The EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Its Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of the EU's latest proposal. Meanwhile the US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, has urged the British public not to let the ""distraction"" ofthe debate over food standards and chlorine-washed chickenblock the ""huge opportunity"" of a trade deal between the countries. He said the US was the world's largest food importer, but currently bought less than one per cent of its food from the UK. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, he said: ""It's time to move on from chlorinated chicken. It's just a bogeyman used to scare you out of doing a great trade deal with America that will give your businesses a huge competitive advantage.""

"Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom is ""deeply disappointed"" by the EU proposal The government will not sign up to a Brexit agreement that breaks up the UK, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has said. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday that the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The DUP - the party Theresa May relies on for a majority in Parliament - has rejected the proposal. The plan is designed to avoid physical checks on the Irish border. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. The UK and the EU remain at loggerheads over the contentious issue of the Irish backstop - which is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland by keeping the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements are worked out. The Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has suggested there may be a possible technical solution to the border problem ""but only if there is trust and goodwill"". Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? No deal Brexit - 'grave outcome' for NI On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. In a series of tweets,externalMr Barnier said the UK would not be forced into a customs union against its will through the Northern Ireland backstop. He said it would be able to exit the single customs territory unilaterally if it chose to do so. But, he added, Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations. Mrs Leadsom said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the proposal. She told the BBC: ""We will not break up the United Kingdom and have a border down the Irish Sea - so, I have to ask myself: what game are [the EU] playing?"" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has also been dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclay tweeted on Friday: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. ""The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides."" The DUP said the proposal disrespected the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, and was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". The UK government has previously said it will not agree to anything which threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. But Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Barnier's position and said the Irish government needed to ""hold firm"" regardless of ""pressure that might be applied from London"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Meanwhile,a report published on Saturday by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee,externalhas suggested a ""world first"" mobile phone identification system could be the way to achieve invisible border controls. The system would use either the mobile phone network or radio frequency identification to check goods or driver's IDs without them leaving the vehicle, in combination with a trusted trader scheme. Border surveillance would utilise automated number plate recognition and CCTV. Lars Karlsson, a former director at the World Customs Organisation, said all the separate elements which made upthe proposal,externalhad been tested ""somewhere in the world, just not in one single border"". The border in Northern Ireland would be ""the first and a leading example in the world of this kind,"" he added. However, the committee urged the UK and EU negotiators to agree on a definition of a hard border by 12 March. ""Mistrust over the backstop protocol has been heightened by lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes a 'hard border',"" said chairman Andrew Murrison. ""My committee is calling for clarification of the term in a legally explicit way to ensure both parties share the same understanding of how the backstop can be avoided."" ""Time is running out to reach common ground,"" the Conservative MP warned. Underthe proposals,,externalcompanies and drivers intending to move goods between the UK and Ireland must be registered to existing EU databases of trusted traders To join the register they must show they meet specific ""risk and compliance"" standards Physical checks of goods would be carried out at a company's premises or by ""mobile inspection units"" (MIUs) The driver's mobile is identified at the border using either the mobile phone network or Radio Frequency Identification. A permit to pass is then sent to the phone A notification is then sent to border control in the import country It could be implemented using ""technical surveillance"" such as CCTV, Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras MIUs from the EU or the UK could then carry out further checks using shared facilities and data MPs are due to vote again on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, but so far the UK has not secured any changes to the withdrawal agreement in its negotiations with Brussels. UK and EU negotiating teams will meet again over the weekend but correspondents say there is little sign of a breakthrough. The first Commons vote on the dealwas rejected by 432 votes to 202 in January, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Leading Brexiteers are unlikely to change their position on the deal unless Mrs May can secure promises that the backstop will not endure indefinitely. Remainer Dominic Grieve, who supports a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. The Labour leadership is also unlikely to back Mrs May's deal.

"Helen McCourt was killed in 1988 A murder victim's mother said she was ""shocked"" her daughter's killer has been allowed out of prison on temporary release. Ian Simms abducted and murdered Helen McCourt in 1988, but has never revealed the location of her body. Ms McCourt's mother Marie told the BBC she was ""angry"" not to have been informed Simms had been allowed ""in the public domain"". The Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on individual cases. Mrs McCourt hasled a campaignto introduce ""Helen's Law"" to block parole for killers who conceal the whereabouts of their victims' bodies. Simms was photographed waiting for a bus in Birmingham bythe Daily Mail,external. He has never revealed the location of 22-year-old Ms McCourt's remains, maintaining he is innocent despite DNA evidence. Mrs McCourt said: ""I was shocked when I saw his face because I don't know what this man looks like [...] especially because he has been in for 31 years now."" Ian Simms outside court in 1988 She added she was also ""relieved"" as ""that picture of him gives me at least some idea of what this man is like"". ""But I am also angry because I want to know - and I will be getting in touch with probation on Monday - why I wasn't informed that he is in the public domain,"" Mrs McCourt said. Her daughter vanished in February 1988 on her way home from her work as an insurance clerk. 'Helen's law' backed by MPs after vote Murderer 'could move to open prison' Law change bid to find victims' bodies Simms, whose pub was just yards from her home in Billinge, near St Helens, quickly became a suspect and he was convicted after her earring was found in his car boot. He was jailed for life in 1989 and told he would have to serve at least 16 years before he could be considered for parole. MP Conor McGinn joined Marie McCourt as they presented a petition at Downing Street in 2018 Last year, Mrs McCourt was told Simms had been outside his open prison - where he had been moved in 2016 - while accompanied by prison officers. At the time she said a parole board officer had told her a prison governor intended to allow Simms to visit a town centre without supervision. Mrs McCourt's MP Conor McGinn, who represents St Helens North, said he had ""asked for an urgent meeting with the justice secretary"" to discuss the case ""but also to get some clarity"" on the government's response to the Helen Law's campaign. Mrs McCourt said she remained ""hopeful that we will get Helen's Law but I really do think that parliament and ministers have to work a lot quicker"". In October 2016, MPs voted in favour of a new ""Helen's Law"" to deny killers parole if they will not reveal the location of their victims' remains but it has yet to receive the government backing it needs to become law. In February 2017, Justice Minister Phillip Lee said such a move risked creating ""perverse incentives"" for murderers to lie about the burial places, causing further ""unthinkable"" pain for victims' families. Dr Lee added that the government was examining other ways to address the issue. More than 580,000 people have signed a petition in support of the law.

"Dame Esther Rantzen has said her broadcasting career would not be as successful if she joined the industry now as a young woman because she would not be ""pretty enough"". The former That's Life! presenter and producer, 78, was a trailblazer for female broadcasters. The TV series, which began in 1973, regularly attracted 20 million viewers. Dame Esther told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs she was ""very lucky"" to have launched her career when she did. ""A few generations earlier, I don't think I could have done it,"" she told presenter Lauren Laverne. ""A few generations later, I wasn't nearly pretty enough."" She said it was ""taken for granted"" earlier in her career that she would not be promoted because of her sex. After getting her job on That's Life! she said she was conscious that ""women weren't given this responsibility before"". ""I was aware that if I didn't do a job well, preferably better than a man would, then I would make it much harder for the next generation of women,"" she said. The BBC One TV series featured light-hearted items alongside serious investigations, including reports on child abuse. Dame Esther with fellow That's Life! presenters Howard Leader, Kevin Devine, and Gavin Campbell in 1993 In 1986 Dame Esther set up Childline - a charity offering support to young people. She told Desert Island Discs the need for the counselling service - which has helped nearly five million children - is as great today as ever. When it started calls were mainly about ""horrible things people were doing to children, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, bullying"", she said. ""Now so much of it is about unhappiness, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders. And bullying has changed and become cyber bullying that you can't escape from."" Silver Line earns Esther a Damehood Esther Rantzen warns of social media 'pressure' on children Dame Esther also spoke about the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager, which she revealed for the first time in 2011. Speaking about her abuser she said: ""I can see him to this day. He used to call me 'bright eyes'. He had one of these creepy smiles and he took me out to buy me a present. ""He found a way of getting me alone and he sexually abused me, not the most serious assault but still horrible."" However, she said her ""lovely"" mother ""didn't really believe me"" when she told her about the abuse. ""My mum, like many parents, cared about the social circle she moved in, cared about not making problems, and in a way wanted me to carry on meeting him and I said, 'Under no circumstance.'"" She did not speak publicly about the abuse until long after she founded Childline. ""Whether I blocked it or whether I chose to forget it, is that the same thing maybe? ""It really didn't occur to me, even after we set up Childline, even after those children were talking to me about terrible things that had happened to them. But then someone asked me the question and the answer was, 'Yes I have been.'"" Dame Esther also set up The Silverline helpline for older people in 2013, after writing about loneliness following the death of her husband in 2000. Speaking about her marriage to Desmond Wilcox, who was married to someone else when they began their relationship, she said: ""Our marriage lasted and we have three wonderful children so I don't regret it. ""But I wish it had happened differently."" Desert Island Discsis on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
