"Mechelle Dillon (left) and Adele Johnstone have campaigned for a full statutory inquiry A panel has called for a public inquiry to be held into institutions for unmarried mothers in Northern Ireland. The three experts also advised that there should be immediate redress payments to survivors. The devolved government committed to an investigation after research into mother-and-baby homes and Magdalene Laundries was published. Women said they were detained against their will, used as unpaid labour and had to give up babies for adoption. The primary recommendation in Tuesday's report is to establish an ""integrated investigation"" by a non-statutory independent panel, feeding into a statutory public inquiry. There are also further recommendations for supporting measures to ensure that victims and survivors can participate in the investigation, including access to records legislation. First Minister Paul Givan, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Health Minister Robin Swann are due to meet the panel on Tuesday evening. They welcomed the report and added that the Northern Ireland Executive would consider the recommendations and ""next steps will be set out by the executive as soon as possible"". Mr Givan said the issue was a priority for the executive. ""I would hope within the next number of weeks the executive will be in a position to take definitive decisions around what the next steps should be,"" he said. Ms O'Neill said the report was ""another step forward for victims and survivors"", adding that she supported a full public enquiry. ""The barbaric way in which women and girls were treated over many decades is utterly shameful and a stain on our society,"" she said. This video can not be played 'One of the great scandals of our time' The Truth Recovery Design Panel recommends: Urgent appointment of a non-statutory independent panel of experts, including those with personal experience Legislation to appoint a statutory public inquiry New legislation to secure access to records for survivors and their families Immediate redress payments from the beginning of the investigation The panel, along with victims and survivors, called on ""all state, religious and other institutions, agencies, organisations and individuals complicit in the processes of institutionalisation and forced labour, family separation and adoption to act without delay in issuing unqualified apologies"". They said that they should clearly state their role, ""accept responsibility for harms done; demonstrate sincerity in their apology; and demonstrate the safeguards now in place to ensure there will be no repetition of the inhumanity and suffering to which they contributed"". 'Secrets have been shattered' 'Significant wrongs' in NI mother-and-baby homes Major findings of NI mother-and-baby homes report 'They called us fallen women, bad women' Listen: Shamed at Birth Maria Cogley, who was born in the Marianvale home in Belfast, told the BBC's Evening Extra programme that ""now is the time to take it [an inquiry] forwards"". ""This is the start,"" she said. ""Now we need the Department of Health and Robin Swann to sign this off as quickly as possible, in full, and the recommendations that are made today, in the report, that's the only way we're going to get the answers to the questions and shine some light on the truth."" The homes and laundries across the island of Ireland have in recent years come to the attention of United Nations (UN) human rights monitors. The former nuns' residence at the Marianvale mother-and-baby home in Newry, County Down Dr Lia Nadaraia, who sits on the UN's Committee Against Torture, and Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), told the BBC there was evidence of ""systematic torture and ill-treatment"". ""Girls and women were involuntarily detained, stripped of their identities, forced to work constantly, and not paid wages,"" she said. Dr Nadaraia said any investigation should be aimed at uncovering the full truth about what happened in the institutions, bringing about prosecutions if possible, and providing financial redress for victims. The Truth Recovery Design Panel, which was established by the Stormont Executive in March, has been working with survivors to come up with recommendations. The three members are Professor Phil Scraton from Queen's University law school, Dr Maeve O'Rourke from the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland (NUI) Galway, and Deirdre Mahon, executive director for social work at the Western Health Trust. The three panel members recommended a public inquiry into the institutions Prof Scraton said that ""lives and futures lost through the cruelty within these institutions cannot be recovered, but we must acknowledge the inter-generational pain and suffering inflicted on victims, survivors and families"". At a press conference, Prof Scraton thanked the victims and survivors, and their families, but said that their pain ""will never, ever, be assuaged by whatever we do because this is one of the great scandals of our time"". This video can not be played 'How dare we, as a society, blame those who suffered the most?' Dr O'Rourke said that any future investigation must be accessible to everyone involved, in particular those with disabilities. ""The key priorities raised by survivors and the relatives are that funding and resources should be sufficient to ensure effective and sustainable implementation of all the panel's recommendations; that the human rights of survivors and relatives are central to the recommendations' implementation; that all of the measures recommended must ensure full access for victims, survivors and relatives of the deceased to information,"" she said. The research report, published in January,found at least 10,500 women passed through mother-and-baby homes. There were eight institutions in Northern Ireland, run by Catholic and Protestant religious organisations. More than 3,000 women spent time in a Magdalene Laundry. These institutions were, in effect, workhouses, and were situated in Londonderry, Belfast, and Newry. The researchers recommended there should be more investigations into levels of infant mortality among children who were born to mothers in the homes. They also said there were more questions to be asked about potential illegal adoptions, including the movement of babies across the border with the Republic of Ireland. Religious orders, and the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, have said they will co-operate with the new investigation. There has already been a state inquiryinto mother-and-baby homes in the Republic of Ireland. Campaigners in Northern Ireland - including the survivors' group Birth Mothers and Their Children For Justice NI - have said the investigation must have the power to compel religious organisations and state agencies to provide records and witnesses.

"Sarah-Jane has sickle-cell disease, lives with constant pain and needs a blood transfusion every six weeks The first new sickle-cell treatment in 20 years will help keep thousands of people out of hospital over the next three years, NHS England has said. Sickle-cell disease is incurable and affects 15,000 people in the UK. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said the hope of reducing health inequalities for black people, who are predominantly affected and often have poorer health outcomes due to a number of social factors, made the drug worth recommending. It called it ""an innovative treatment"". The drug, crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions. And in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally. These painful episodes, which can require hospital treatment and lead to other health complications, are caused by by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the small blood vessels . But because the trial was small and lasted only a year, it remains unknown how long the benefits last for - and that makes it difficult to judge how cost-effective crizanlizumab is. Nevertheless, NICE, which recommends treatments in England and Wales, is recommending its use for over-16s, albeit under a special arrangement rather than routinely, on the NHS. And additional data on the treatment will be collected through clinical trials. The charity Sickle Cell Society said the new treatment brought ""new hope"" for people living with the world's most common genetic blood condition. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: ""The moment that a new drug comes that is approved to be used, our job is to make sure that we can do a deal to ensure it's affordable and get it out as quickly as possible."" Sarah-Jane has to rely on a whole range of medication to manage her sickle-cell disease, including very strong painkillers Diagnosed at birth, Sarah-Jane Nkrumah, 27, had her first crisis aged six months and has chronic pain in her joints. ""Every day is pain,"" she says. ""I don't remember the last time I had zero pain."" Sarah-Jane prefers to take breaks from taking painkillers -  but some days cannot get out of bed. ""You just have to try and manage it,"" she says. ""I don't have a choice. ""It's all about having a lot of mental strength and support."" And every six weeks, she has a blood transfusion to boost her energy levels. ""I feel weak and exhausted leading up to them and refreshed and stronger afterwards,"" she says. ""Thanks to donors, I get a chance to live another day."" Sarah-Jane had to give up her ambition to become a nursery teacher because it put her at risk of serious infection. ""Now, I have found my true purpose and love spreading awareness of sickle-cell disease,"" she says. Meindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, at NICE, said: ""Treatment for sickle-cell disease has been limited for years and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. ""Crizanlizumab... has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades."" It is inherited from both parents, who pass on a particular gene It is possible to carry the gene without having the disease Nearly 300 babies are born with it each year in the UK A simple blood test will show whether someone has it Children with sickle cell are at greater risk of stroke Other symptoms can include serious infections, anaemia and tiredness Source: Sickle Cell Society / NHS UK Sickle cell disease - NHS About Sickle Cell Â» Sickle Cell Society Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The Canadian actor famously played Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise The actor who played Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series is set to embark on a real-life journey into space. US tech billionaire Jeff Bezos's space travel company Blue Origin confirmed that William Shatner would be blasting off from Texas on 12 October. Aged 90, the actor will become the oldest person to have flown into space. ""I've heard about space for a long time now. I'm taking the opportunity to see it for myself. What a miracle,"" Shatner said in a statement. Shatner will be joining three other people aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket for the company's second human spaceflight. Amazon founderJeff Bezos joined the first crewed flight in July,along with his brother, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race and an 18-year-old student. This video can not be played The moment Jeff Bezos and crew launch into space on the first human flight of New Shepard As with the previous flight, the October voyage is expected to last about 10 minutes and will take the crew just beyond the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space which lies 100km (60 miles) above the Earth. Blue Origin said its vice president of mission and flight operations, Audrey Powers, would also be on board the flight, as well as a former Nasa engineer and the co-founder of a software company specialising in clinical research. A Canadian actor, Shatner famously played Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise in the original Star Trek TV series in the 1960s, and later appeared in films of the franchise. Reports in 2013 said he had turned down Sir Richard Branson's offer to fly him into space with Virgin Galactic -the billionaire's space travel company which took Sir Richard to the edge of spacein July. Sir Richard told The Sun newspaper at the time it was because Shatner has a fear of flying. But in 2011 the actor said he had turned down the offer because the billionaire allegedly wanted him to pay for the journey. ""He wanted me to go up and pay for it and I said: 'Hey, you pay me and I'll go up. I'll risk my life for a large sum of money.' But he didn't pick me up on my offer,"" Shatner told reporters. The Star Trek star will not however be the first original cast member to leave the planet. Last yearThe Times revealed,externalthat the ashes of James Doohan, who played Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, were smuggled on board the International Space Station in 2008, three years after Doohan's death. New Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. Dubbed ""NewSpace"", an increasing number of entrepreneurs are joining in the race to create cheap, commercialised space travel. Bezos's Blue Origin hit headlines in recent days after21 current and former employees claimed it had ignored safety concernsto gain an advantage in the space race, and complained of a culture of sexism. Blue Origin rejected the charges and said it stands by its safety record.

"About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel. One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a ""marked improvement"" across the rest of the UK thanks to ""steady deliveries"". But conditions in the South East are ""still challenging"", the PRA said. The improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its Â£30 cap on buying fuel at its sites. It said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England. However, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease ""in the coming days"" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies. About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts. The PRA said the situation around London and the South East was ""still challenging"". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry. In the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel ""thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand"", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry. ""We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. The PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts. Is the petrol shortage improving? The government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts. More than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers. The drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work. Hoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. A government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was ""continuing to stabilise"". ""More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,"" the spokesperson said. 23 September:BP temporarily closes some petrol stationsdue to a shortage of lorry drivers 25 September:After days of long queues at stations, with many running dry, the governmentannounces a temporary visa scheme, allowing 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas 27 September:The Army is put on standbyto help deliver fuel to stations hit by shortages 28 September:Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays the situation at forecourts is ""stabilising"", while the PRA says there are ""early signs"" pressure is starting to ease at pumps 2 October:Despite a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide,the PRA says petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England 4 October: Army starts to deliver fuel to speed up replenishments The crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. Many sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes. David Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies. ""This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,"" he said. ""We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"Adele's last high-profile appearance was as host of NBC's Saturday Night Live almost a year ago Adele has heightened speculation that she is about to release her first new music since 2015, after updating her website and social media pages. The star's Twitter and Instagram images were changed to a blue and turquoise pattern, while her old website was scrubbed and replaced with a link urging fans to sign up for information. It comes after the number 30 was projected onto several buildings around the world over the weekend. Fans are predicting this will be the name of her fourth album - after 19, 21 and 25. The mysterious projections have been spotted on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, Amsterdam's Nemo Museum and New York's Empire State Building. The logo has also reportedly appeared in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, South Korea and the UK. Although they have not officially been confirmed as being linked to Adele, the images appear to use the font she has favoured on her previous albums. Allow Twitter content?

The singer hinted that her fourth album would be called 30 in a 2019 Instagram post,jokingly telling fans,external: ""30 will be a drum and bass record to spite you all."" Using the title would also connect the album to Adele's previous pattern of naming records after a pivotal year in her life. She has previously said she would retire the system, saying that she had settled into family life. But the singer separated from her ex-husband Simon Konecki when she was 30 (she is now 33) and has subsequently kept a low public profile. The one exception was a stint hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live last year. Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL Adele: The full story Adele files for divorce from husband Simon Konecki At the time, she addressed the rumours that new music was imminent. ""I know there's been a lot of chatter about me just being the host. Like, 'Why isn't she the musical guest?' and stuff like that,"" she said. ""And there's a couple of reasons. My album's not finished, and I'm also too scared to do bothâ¦ I'd rather just put on some wigs, have a glass of wine or six and just see what happens."" Fraser T Smith, who co-wrote Adele's global smash hit Set Fire To The Rain, recently told the BBC he ""didn't know"" whether the star's new album was complete. ""Adele is incredibly secretive, and I think that that's the way you want it - building that suspense,"" he said. ""A testament to her is that you just don't know the next direction she'll take.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""Our recovery comes with a cost"" Rishi Sunak has told Conservative party members that future tax cuts are conditional on repairing the UK's public finances after Covid. In his first conference speech as chancellor, he said he wanted lower taxes - but funding the pandemic recovery ""comes with a cost"". Vowing that ""we need to fix our public finances"", he said allowing borrowing to rise further would be ""immoral"". The comments come three weeks before his autumn Budget on 27 October. He also told party delegates that leaving the EU was in the UK's long-term interests, despite current disruption to fuel and food supplies. And he added he was ""proud"" to have backed Brexit, in spite of warnings before the 2016 referendum it could end his political career. PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit Sunak: No magic wand to solve supply problems Mr Sunak's speech comes amid a difficult backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside supply chain disruption caused by a shortage of lorry drivers. The government has so far rejected demands from the haulage industry for it to increase the 5,000 temporary visas it plans for foreign drivers to plug shortfalls. In his speech, Mr Sunak insisted that despite ""challenges"", Brexit would foster a ""culture of enterprise"" and help the UK adapt to the modern world. He also defendedraising taxesto pay for the NHS and social care, insisting that it would be ""irresponsible"" to pay for investment with higher borrowing instead. He told delegates the country should be grateful for ""sound Conservative management"" of the economy by his predecessors since 2010. And whilst he acknowledged tax rises were unpopular and perceived as ""un-Conservative"", he said they were a better option than more debt. ""I'll tell you what is un-Conservative: Unfunded pledges, reckless borrowing, and soaring debt,"" he added. ""Yes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that, our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing."" There was no whizz-bangery in the chancellor's speech - no cranking of the huge economic levers on tax or spending, no huge headline grabbing policy. And, a little like Rishi Sunak himself, it was quite short. (He made a little joke about his stature himself...) This felt like the first draft of Sunak-ism: where the chancellor has come from, what he's all about, where he might go in the future, to an audience where many will wonder if he might one day be prime minister. There were repeated references to his time in California, that spot so often associated with sunshine and innovation. After the public spending splurges of the pandemic, he portrayed himself as a traditional Conservative: cautious in how taxpayers' money is spent, drawn to cut taxes when he can - even though he's put them up. This hoodie-wearing chancellor - although he did wear a suit for his speech - made 16 references to the ""future,"" including the line ""the future is here."" Whom could he have been referring to? Against the backdrop of the withdrawal of aÂ£20-a-week universal credit top-up, Mr Sunak also attacked Labour - which opposes the cut - for wanting struggling families to ""lean ever more on the state"". ""Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?,"" he asked, adding: ""Be in no doubt, that is the essence of the Labour answer"". ""Not only does Labour's approach not work in practice, it is a desperately sad vision for our future."" ""But there is an alternative. An approach focused on good work, better skills, and higher wages."" Mr Sunak also announced the government would give funding to double the number of Turing research fellows investigating the potential of artificial intelligence. He also committed Â£500m to renew job support programmes set up during the Covid pandemic, after the end of the furlough scheme last month. The Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022. And the JETS scheme, which helps long-term unemployed people on universal credit, will be prolonged until September 2022. The Treasury said that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review, which will take place alongside the Budget later this month.

"Courts will get new powers to stop disruptive activists attending protests, the home secretary has said. In a Tory conference speech, Priti Patel said new orders would stop the ""small minority of offenders"" intent on ""causing disruption"". A Tory source said they will target people with a ""history of disruption"", or those likely to commit crime. Climate activists blocking roads have previously been warned they couldface fines and up to six months in prison. Protests from Insulate Britain have continued in recent days, despite three court injunctions banningactivists blocking the M25, and other major roads in London,external. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? On Tuesday the High Court heard that more than 100 protesters associated with the group have now been served with injunctions. The group has apologised for disruption - but added that ""the reality of our situation"" on climate change has to be faced. Thieves and burglars to be fitted with GPS tags 'Sobriety ankle tags' rolled out across England Patel pledges to crack down on motorway protests In her conference speech in Manchester, Ms Patel unveiled plans to increase the maximum sentence for disruption of a motorway. She also announced a new criminal offence for interfering with critical national infrastructures such as roads, railways and newspaper printing presses. Police are also expected to be given wider stop and search powers allowing officers to inspect activists for ""lock on"" equipment used to prevent them from being moved. The new measures to be announced by Ms Patel are to be included in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill currently going through Parliament. Ms Patel said the actions of climate activists, who in recent weeks have blocked the M1, M4 and M25, ""amounted to some of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen."" ""Freedom to protest is a fundamental right our party will forever fight to uphold. But it must be within the law,"" she added. Insulate Britain activists blocking a motorway junction near Heathrow Airport The campaign by Insulate Britain has been running for over three weeks and has led to hundreds of arrests. The group wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions. On Tuesday, the High Court heard that 111 activists associated with the group had been served with injunctions. A hearing on the injunctions has been adjourned to next week, after government lawyers argued all three should be dealt with together. Speaking outside the court, an Insulate Britain spokesman said the group ""wishes to profoundly apologise for the disruption caused over the past three weeks."" He added: ""We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But we believe that the reality of our situation has to be faced."" On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Insulate Britain activists as ""irresponsible crusties"". He told LBC: ""There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters."" He added: ""They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy."" This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" On Monday,Insulate Britain activists were confronted by angry drivers as they blocked more London roads, including the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory. In a video captured by LBC, a motorist told demonstrators she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital, asking them: ""How can you be so selfish?"" In other footage shared by Talk Radio, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. But in an open letter to Ms Patel, Insulate Britain said: ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere."" One activist told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Members of Insulate Britain held banners outside the Royal Courts of Justice earlier Meanwhile, Dominic Raab used his first speech as the new justice secretary to promise Â£183m with the aim of doubling the number of offenders in England and Wales on electronic tags by 2025. He told delegates this included an expansion in the ""game-changing"" use ofalcohol-monitoring ankle tagson offenders, to see if they breach court-ordered drinking bans. Mr Raab, who was also made deputy prime minister in last month'scabinet reshuffle, also pledged Â£90m to pay for more hours of community payback by offenders. Referencing the ""harrowing"" murder of Sarah Everard, he also vowed to make tackling violence against women and girls his ""number one priority"".

"This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" Insulate Britain protesters have been confronted by angry drivers as the group blocked more roads in London. Police arrested 38 climate change activists near the Blackwall Tunnel entrance during the morning rush hour. One driver confronted the demonstrators saying she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital. ""How can you be so selfish?"" she asked. Insulate Britain defended its tactics, saying disruptive direct action was effective and led to policy change. In a video captured by LBC,external, the driver said her mother was ""in the ambulance"", saying, ""She's going to the hospital in Canterbury. Do you think I'm stupid?"" ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass,"" she added. Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory were also targeted. It follows recent protests on the M25 and M4. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The Blackwall Tunnel is the latest river crossing to be targeted In other footage shared byTalk Radio,external, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. London Ambulance Service have also appealed to Insulate Britain to let their drivers pass. A spokesperson said: ""Ultimately, a delay to us reaching someone who needs our care can cost lives. We would ask any protesters to please allow our crews to pass to ensure we are able to reach people who need our help as quickly as possible."" Another driver held up was Dr Malik Saleh, a dentist who was stuck at the Hanger Lane gyratory. He said the protest had caused ""a crazy amount of inconvenience"" and that he had to cancel his appointments. ""The point is valid but there must be a better way around it,"" he said. A father, who wanted to be identified only as Will, said he was worried his 15-year-old autistic daughter, who has stress-related epilepsy, could have a seizure brought on by the fear of missing school, after she was stuck in the traffic for 45 minutes. He said the ""beeping and shouting"" did not help because of her sensory problems and she did not have her ear-defenders. ""If she does carry on stressing out at school today it will bring on a seizure. These protesters don't realise the consequences of their actions at all, and who it affects."" Ministers plan to enact tougher powers to tackle their direct action which has seen blockages to key arteries around London, including on the M25 and M4. Last month,the government won a High Court injunction, warning climate change protesters they could be jailed if they continued their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested since the group's demonstrations started last month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A reference by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ""Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days"" was met with boos at a fringe Maritime UK drinks reception at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday evening. Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes. Responding to criticism of the disruption caused to drivers, spokesman Craig Scudder said current government policies did not go far enough and disruptive action worked. He told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Mr Scudder said Insulate Britain had a policy of allowing blue light emergency vehicles to pass its roadblocks and the group provided video footage of activists moving to accommodate ambulances and medical cars.

"This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick: ""My job now is to lead the Met through a difficult time"" An independent review is set to be carried out into the Met Police's standards and culture after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, said it would be led by a high profile person. The force has faced questions ever since Wayne Couzens, a serving police officer, killed the 33-year-old. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a ""massive job"" to do in restoring women's confidence in the police. Last week, Couzens, 48, was jailed for a full-life termfor the brutal attack. He abducted the marketing executive in March as she walked home from a friend's house under the guise of an arrest, before raping and killing her. He later burned her body. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Sarah Everard's murder sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women Dame Cressida said the review would specifically look into its internal culture and its professional standards such as systems, processes, leadership and training. She also called for a national review of police vetting standards. It comes asLabour raised concernsabout checks on parliamentary police in a letter to security officials. An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Couzens was known as ""the rapist"" by former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary because he made female colleagues feel so uncomfortable, and had been accused of indecent exposure in 2015, and in the days before the murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is now investigating ""offensive and abusive"" sexist messages shared by a WhatsApp group that involved Couzens. Met chief faces calls to quit over Everard case The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick Former Met Police detective Paige Kimberley won an employment tribunal against the force last month, after a job offer was withdrawn when she complained about ""vulgar and sexist"" WhatsApp group messages involving police officers. Ms Kimberley said the group, which did not involve Couzens, was set up to ""facilitate working practices"". Over time the comments became ""more sexualised, and more and more derogatory towards women"", she said. ""When I was approached to go back to work... I did bring up the WhatsApp group, I did say that it needed to be addressed,"" she said. ""And the next day I was told there was no position available for me."" Ms Kimberely, who reached the rank of deputy superintendent, said: ""What has really shocked me is that the extent to which the Met fought me, the way the Met have defended this. ""They clearly do think it's okay."" The review will look into the internal culture of the Met Police Baroness Nuala O'Loan, whoseinquiry into Daniel Morgan's murderconcluded that the Met was ""institutionally corrupt"", said the murder of Ms Everard raised similar issues. She said: ""We said that in their failure to be honest, for reputational reason, the conduct of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police, and of the institution, was corrupt. It was all about protecting the Met. ""Can you trust when you don't see actions to address the problems which you've pointed out to them?"" Dame Cressida said: ""I absolutely recognise the grave level of public concerns and the need to take urgent action. ""I hope the announcement today of an independent person to work with us helps demonstrate how seriously we take this and our commitment to making the changes needed."" When asked if she offered to resign, Dame Cressida said: ""People will be entitled to their opinion. I've got a job to do, I'm getting on with it. My job now is to lead the Met."" Earlier, the prime minister rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry from the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, who said there should be one into the vetting process used by the Met Police when recruiting officers. Dame Cressida Dick has rejected calls to resign after the murder of Sarah Everard Mr Johnson said the investigations by the Met and police watchdog should be allowed to proceed. He added although the government was investing in CCTV and street lighting, the culture of policing had to change and that more women should be recruited as police officers. ""I want to be clear, I believe people should be confident in the police,"" he said. ""I believe police officers, men and women up and down the country, will be absolutely sickened by what has happened, and they will be doing everything they can, and I know they do everything they can to help and reassure the public. So, it is vital that the public trust the police.""

"Adele's last high-profile appearance was as host of NBC's Saturday Night Live almost a year ago Adele has heightened speculation that she is about to release her first new music since 2015, after updating her website and social media pages. The star's Twitter and Instagram images were changed to a blue and turquoise pattern, while her old website was scrubbed and replaced with a link urging fans to sign up for information. It comes after the number 30 was projected onto several buildings around the world over the weekend. Fans are predicting this will be the name of her fourth album - after 19, 21 and 25. The mysterious projections have been spotted on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, Amsterdam's Nemo Museum and New York's Empire State Building. The logo has also reportedly appeared in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, South Korea and the UK. Although they have not officially been confirmed as being linked to Adele, the images appear to use the font she has favoured on her previous albums. Allow Twitter content?

The singer hinted that her fourth album would be called 30 in a 2019 Instagram post,jokingly telling fans,external: ""30 will be a drum and bass record to spite you all."" Using the title would also connect the album to Adele's previous pattern of naming records after a pivotal year in her life. She has previously said she would retire the system, saying that she had settled into family life. But the singer separated from her ex-husband Simon Konecki when she was 30 (she is now 33) and has subsequently kept a low public profile. The one exception was a stint hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live last year. Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL Adele: The full story Adele files for divorce from husband Simon Konecki At the time, she addressed the rumours that new music was imminent. ""I know there's been a lot of chatter about me just being the host. Like, 'Why isn't she the musical guest?' and stuff like that,"" she said. ""And there's a couple of reasons. My album's not finished, and I'm also too scared to do bothâ¦ I'd rather just put on some wigs, have a glass of wine or six and just see what happens."" Fraser T Smith, who co-wrote Adele's global smash hit Set Fire To The Rain, recently told the BBC he ""didn't know"" whether the star's new album was complete. ""Adele is incredibly secretive, and I think that that's the way you want it - building that suspense,"" he said. ""A testament to her is that you just don't know the next direction she'll take. It could be R&B, it could be rock, it could the ballads. ""But whatever it's going to be, it will be of the highest standard."" Allow YouTube content?

"Dale Morgan admitted the killing took place sometime between December and February A man who murdered his mother with a hammer and continued to live in her home with the body for two months, has been jailed for life. Dale Morgan, 43, carried out the ""sustained and brutal"" attack on 68-year-old Judith Rhead in December 2020. Her decomposing body was partially clothed with a plastic bag tied over her head, Swansea Crown Court heard. Morgan, of Honeyborough Green, Neyland, will serve a minimum of 21-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to murder. The former scout leader admitted the killing happened sometime between 10 December 2020 and 20 February 2021. Judge Paul Thomas QC described it as a ""savage and sustained attack against a defenceless woman, your mother"". The court heard Morgan pretended to his mother's friends and neighbours that she was either isolating at home because of Covid-19, was ill or was in hospital. But police went to her home on 20 February after being contacted by her concerned friends. Judith Rhead's body was found partially clothed with a plastic bag tied over her head Paul Lewis QC, prosecuting, said the evidence suggested Morgan killed his mother on a date between 11 and 18 December. ""It is plain the defendant bludgeoned his mother repeatedly with a hammer,"" he said. ""She was slumped in a kneeling position against the bed and her right hand and forearm were on the bed and she was partially clothed, and a plastic bag had been placed over her head and had been tied in place with an electrical cable. ""There was bloodstaining on the bed and at the foot of the bed officers found a hammer. ""It was clear to the officers that the body of Mrs Rhead had been there for some time and her body had started to decompose."" A note written by Mrs Rhead said: ""Huge lies ie car, work had been furloughed, stealing money, stealing medication, drug addiction, opiates."" Mr Lewis said: ""It is clear from the note that prior to her death she had concerns about the defendant taking money from her."" The court heard Mrs Rhead had been struck on the head 14 times. Mr Lewis said: ""Only the defendant knows why he killed his mother, and he has never ventured an account. ""Another possible theory is that his mother confronted him because he was stealing, and in order to prevent her from taking steps, he killed her. We simply do not know."" Judith Rhead's body was found at a property on Market Street in February Morgan was arrested later that day and has been in custody since, pleading guilty to murder at a hearing on 31 August. Sentencing, Judge Thomas told only-child Morgan his mother stuck up for him when he previously stole from her. ""She tried to help you with your problems,"" he said. ""She worried about your substance misuse, and she let you live with her despite the disruption and anxiety your presence in the house no doubt caused her. ""In short, you were pretty much her life. You repaid those 43 years of devotion by bludgeoning her to death with a hammer. Not once, not twice, but no fewer than 14 times to the head, intending to kill her. ""She was, on that day, when you had that hammer in your hand, entirely at your mercy. ""Although she probably begged you for it, you showed none. It was a savage, sustained attack on a defenceless, vulnerable woman - your own mother. ""Even after you had killed her, your callous attitude continued, and you tied a plastic bag around her head and left her lifeless body slumped in the bedroom. ""You did not even afford her the dignity of a timely burial. You just left her to decompose while others fretted about her whereabouts."" Senior investigating officer, Det Supt Jayne Butler, said: ""Judith Rhead was the victim of an horrific attack. ""The fact that it was at the hands of her own son and in her own home only adds to the cruelty and horror of what she went through."" A family statement said: ""We cannot come to terms with what has happened to Judith and we never will. ""Judith was a well-respected woman in her community and with a wide circle of friends. ""She was such a gentle person, who did not deserve to die in such a horrific way. ""This is something that will haunt our family for the rest of our lives.""

"Ozy's chief executive Carlos Watson was a former news anchor for CNN In an about-turn, the scandal-hit US media firm Ozy Media has re-launched just days after it shut itself down. Boss Carlos Watson told broadcaster NBC that the firm was ""open for business"" again and this was its ""Lazarus moment"" - referring to the biblical character brought back to life by Jesus.

"Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. It blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email. The services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday. But the company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". Sheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building"" to work out what had gone wrong. In a statement,Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools,externaland systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. Many found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. According to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

An outage of this scale for such a long time is rare. A disruption in 2019 left Facebook and its other apps mostlyinaccessible across the world for more than 14 hours.

The disruption comes the day after an interview with a former Facebook employee who leaked documents about the company. Frances Haugen told CBS news on Sunday thatthe company had prioritised ""growth over safety"". On Tuesday she will testify before a Senate subcommittee in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online"", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users. Many outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country. This outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs. The length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of ""mayhem"" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem. Interesting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem. It should also be said that Facebook's statement is carefully written. It doesn't rule out foul play. The week had already started off badly - after the whistleblower in the ""Facebook Files"" revelations revealed herself on Sunday. But a bad week has become a terrible one for the social network.

"Cass Ezeji says felt ""lost"" at Gaelic school but has since gained an appreciation of her education Gaelic speakers of African and Caribbean descent have shared their experiences of the language in a new BBC Alba documentary. Glaswegian student and musician Cass Ezeji says some people she meets think it is unusual she is fluent in Gaelic and also has African heritage. Her paternal grandfather is Nigerian. Growing up, Cass went to the Glasgow Gaelic School, Sgoil GhÃ idhlig Ghlaschu, which teaches at both primary and secondary school levels. Cass' parents, who do not speak Gaelic, chose the school because they thought she would get a good education there. But Cass says she felt ""a little lost"" in immersive Gaelic-medium education, and among peers whose families were from the Highlands and Islands - the Western Isles are Gaelic's ""heartland"". She says she argued with her mum about having to go to the school, and even felt angry about it. The 27-year-old says: ""The impression I had when I left school was that I didn't feel part of the Gaelic world. ""I didn't see myself represented in the culture so there was something of a disconnect."" But she says she has since gained an appreciation of her education and describes herself as an Afro-Gael. Through making the documentary, which also examines racism and Scotland's historical links with the slave trade, Cass met other women of African and Caribbean descent who are also Gaelic speakers. Amina Davidson says she loves being part of Scotland's traditional music scene They include Amina Davidson, a traditional musician who lives in the Partick area of Glasgow. During the first lockdown last year, she joined her neighbour Robert Robertson - singer with the Scottish band Tide Lines - in singing the Gaelic song Teann a-Nall from the windows of their tenements to entertain other residents. A video of the performance on social media went viral. ""It now has 1.5 million views,"" says Amina. The singer says she enjoys being part of the traditional Scottish and Gaelic music scene, adding: ""It's a small, friendly world which I enjoy. ""Everyone knows one another and there are lots of traditional musicians in this area where I live."" Carrie Prescott says people sometimes find it unusual that she speaks Gaelic Carrie Prescott, of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, started learning Gaelic as an adult as part of a degree and is actively involved in the language and culture. She says: ""Sometimes when I'm at Gaelic events, or I'm speaking to somebody, and it transpires that I speak Gaelic they find it very unusual. ""They're not expecting us to be able to speak Gaelic."" Tawana Maramba, of Tranent, East Lothian, is a student and Gaelic singer. Her parents are from Zimbabwe and they raised her to speak their Shona language, but also encouraged her interest in other languages and placed her in a Gaelic-medium education primary school. Cass and Tawana Maramba, second right, and the Maramba family She says: ""In high school the only Gaelic-medium subject was Gaelic language, but in primary school every subject was in Gaelic. ""That was so good in primary school because it meant that we spoke Gaelic every day."" Tawana now teaches Gaelic singing and participates at the Royal National Mod, an annual celebration of the language and culture. Last year, she appeared in a Gaelic short film about Eliza Junor,a girl from Guyana and the descendant of slaves who grew up in Fortrose in the Highlands in the early 19th Century. Tawana says: ""I feel some people react like: 'Oh you speak Gaelic?' ""But I'm quite proud of that. It plays a huge part in my life."" The documentary, Trusadh: Afro-GÃ idheil - Afro-Gaels, will be shown on BBC Alba on Monday at 21:00 and will later be available on iPlayer.

"Mr Flynn wants more to be done to reduce the back-log of drivers waiting for tests A lack of examiners is largely to blame for the UK shortage of HGV drivers, a lorry driving instructor has said. Steven Flynn, who runs Carmel Driving School in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said he has dozens of drivers waiting to take their tests. Waiting times and delayed paper work contributed to the ""heart-breaking"" situation, he said. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said it was ""tackling this issue through increasing testing"". Why is there an HGV driver shortage? What's in short supply and why? Retailers warn of Christmas turkey shortage fears Bus driver shortage sees 15 routes suspended Theshortage of HGV driversis due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors, and has led to growing concerns about deliveries of food and fuel. For Mr Flynn, the problem is there are not enough examiners available to book tests. ""There hasn't been an investment in examiners in the last few years and the pandemic hasn't helped either... but they could do a lot more than what they actually are doing,"" he said. ""We've got in excess of at least 30 to 35 people waiting to go for their tests. We have enough vehicles, we have enough instructors, but we simply don't have the tests."" Mr Flynn said that after spring's lockdown, some of his drivers had to wait three months to book a test. Although the situation has now ""massively improved"", he said the waiting times are still ""too long"", claiming more examiners would have helped. ""We have built brand-new facilities here and all we would need is an examiner to come,"" he said. ""The test centre is just around the corner - which they're proposing to close - and some of the days there aren't any examiners there, simply because of the lack of investment in examiners."" Mr Flynn said he cannot expand the business and employ more instructors until more tests become available. He also said booking tests online was not always possible, and it was ""heart-breaking"" spending up to two hours every day on hold, trying to book by phone. Apology over continuing driving licence renewal delays 'Catastrophic' backlog at driving licence body People left 'isolated' without bus services While testing is covered by the DVSA, Mr Flynn said waiting for documentation was also a serious problem, with ""paperwork taking weeks and weeks"" to come back from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Andrew Lloyd, national officer for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said the DVLA must take responsibility. He said: ""If there is anyone waiting for their driver's licence from DVLA, just to let you know PCS asked DVLA management a number of months ago now to prioritise key workers' driver's licences and correspondence. That would include lorry drivers. DVLA have not even bothered to respond to their trade union. This crisis is on the DVLA management."" A DVLA spokesman said there were no delays in processing HGV provisional licence applications which were currently being issued in about five days, adding: ""We are looking at ways to speed up this process even further."" He added: ""More complex transactions, for example if medical investigations are needed as part of a driving licence application, may face longer delays. ""We have made it a priority to process provisional and vocational HGV licences as quickly as possible."" Llew Jones Coaches' director says more and more drivers are finding work elsewhere and not returning to the industry In the Conwy Valley, Llew Jones Coaches has had to suspend part of one of its bus routes ""due to a lack of driving staff"". Steve Jones, managing director, said Covid had seen an increase in the number of drivers retiring from the industry and ""so very few new people have come into the industry"" due to limited training in that period. Mr Jones said they were ""running about 10 drivers short of where we would want to be"" and called for a simpler process of acquiring a test and dealing with the governing agencies. ""We need to reduce the red tape and get people through quicker,"" he said. ""We need more examiners so we can get more tests through,"" says Steve Jones The DVSA said it recognised the haulage industry fuels the economy and had ""listened to its concerns about the current lorry driver shortage"". ""We have responded by doing all we can to support the industry in tackling this issue through increasing lorry driver testing,"" it said. Current waiting times for vocational tests were on average 3.3 weeks, compared with a pre-Covid rate of 2.7 weeks. And 3,000 vocational tests were being done a week, compared with 2,000 pre-Covid, the DVSA said.

"A huge leak of financial documents has put the spotlight on the hidden assets of some of the world's most powerful people. Unsurprisingly, the Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed? The Pandora Papers revealed thatKing Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US. But stories on the leak were notably absent in Jordan where - observers say - local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. On Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately-owned Al-Ghad, Al-Dustour andJordan Times,externalnewspapers, were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country. They were also prioritising stories about King Abdullah meeting the World Bank president, and his first phone call with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the Syrian civil war a decade ago. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. The palace also put out a statement,externalsaying that it was ""no secret"" that the king owned a number of properties abroad. ""Any allegations that link these private properties to public funds or assistance are baseless and deliberate attempts to distort facts,"" it said. Jordan's King Abdullah II There was also deafening silence over the leak in much of the media in Kenya, where thefamily of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The Star newspaper was leading with the story on its website, under the headline ""No evidence Kenyatta's stole state assets - Pandora Papers"". Others either did not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. The country's leading daily newspaper The Nation published a story written by a news agency with the headline ""Pandora Papers expose leaders' offshore millions"", using a picture of Jordan's king. The story included four lines about the Kenyattas. Citizen TV - the biggest TV station in Kenya - also published agency copy on its website, in which the revelations about Mr Kenyatta's family were at the end. The Standard and The People Daily newspapers did not publish the findings on their websites. However, the leak was sparking a lot of conversation on social media in Kenya, with the hashtag #PandoraPapers and #client 13173 - the code name the Kenyattas were given by their asset managers - trending on Twitter. Mr Kenyatta's family have not yet responded to requests for comment. LIVE:Reaction to the leaks BACKGROUND:A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak The leak linkedRussian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco. However, Russia's main Sunday evening TV news reviews made no mention of the allegations, which were published shortly before the programmes aired. The Russian part of the investigation was published by the website Vazhnyye Istorii (Important Stories). The English-language Moscow Times news site had the Pandora Papers as its top story on Monday, with the headline: ""Leaked papers link Putin associates to offshore dealings"". Russian social media users have also been talking about the revelations. However a number of media outlets steered stories away from President Putin. The state-owned Gazprom-Media's NTV aired a brief report on the investigation on Monday morning, focusing on allegations against foreign officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Meanwhile, state news agency Tasshighlighted findings related to the US being used as a tax haven,external. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday called the findings ""a collection of fairly groundless claims"". The Pandora Papers revealed that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky transferred his stake in a secret offshore company just before he won the 2019 election. Ukraine's Slidstvo.info website published an investigation based on the data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and the English-language Kyiv Post had the findings as its top story with the headline: ""Pandora Papers reveal offshore holdings of Zelensky and his inner circle"". However, it was not a major story in most Ukrainian media. The findings were widely discussed online, including in a number of blogs, with many arguing that the revelations would not affect Mr Zelensky's popularity. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky The papers revealed that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis - who is facing an election later this week - failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for Â£12m in the south of France. The findings were initially published by Investigace.cz, and then picked up by a number of media outlets, including the Pravo newspaper, which ran the story on its front page. Mr Babis'denial of having done anything illegal,externalwas being widely reported on Monday. The Novinky news site alsoquoted opposition figure Petr Fiala as calling for answers.,external ""Andrej Babis must prove that he used taxed money for the transaction. If not, he has no right to be in politics and take care of taxpayers' money,"" he said. But despite the leak being widely covered, most media focus has remained on general election coverage. It is not clear whether the leak will have an impact on the outcome of the vote. The leak found that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. All of Pakistan's major newspapers covered the revelations. The leak was discussed on Pakistan's Dunya TV talk show ""Think Tank"" on Sunday. The website of Dawn newspaper - the largest and oldest English-language newspaper in Pakistan - was leading on Monday with a number of stories about the Pandora Papers and the Pakistani findings. The coverage has been met with cautious or defensive reactions from those who were named. Mr Khan said his government would investigate all citizens mentioned in the report. ""We welcome the Pandora Papers exposing the ill-gotten wealth of elites, accumulated through tax evasion & corruption & laundered out to financial 'havens',"" he tweeted. Three presidents and 11 former presidents from Latin America have been mentioned in the investigation. One of them is Ecuador's Guillermo Lasso, a former banker, who replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017. Reacting to the revelations, Mr Lasso said all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, were legal. The news involving the president is the main headline on the website of newspaper Expreso, but many Ecuadorean outlets have given it little or no coverage. The website of newspaper El Universo ran several items about the findings, including those related to the president. They also reported on the revelation that Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, a star in Latin America, has a ""property empire"" in Florida of an estimated value of up to $120m. President of Ecuador Guillermo Lasso Another Latin American leader mentioned in the papers is Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a billionaire businessman, who is accused of selling a copper and iron mine in an environmentally sensitive area to a childhood friend,as detailed in Spain's El PaÃ­s newspaper,external. In 2010, nine months after Mr PiÃ±era took office, his family sold their shares in the mine for $152m. Part of the deal took place in the British Virgin Islands. The Chilean presidency said Mr PiÃ±era had no role in, or information about, the sale of the mining project, and that he had not been involved in the management of any company for more than 12 years. Many Chilean outlets are covering the leaks, with the website of newspaper La NaciÃ³n giving a lot of prominence to local reaction, with Senator Manuel JosÃ© OssandÃ³n, who belongs to the president's party, calling for an investigation. The Pandora Papers showed that the law firm founded by Cyprus's President Nicos Anastasiades appears to have provided fake owners to disguise the real owner of a series of offshore companies - a former Russian politician who had been accused of embezzlement. The findings were given prominent coverage on many Cypriot news sites, including the Greek-language Politis and Phileleftheros. Mr Anastasiadestold local media he had ""no knowledge"" of what the company was claimed to have done.,externalThe law firm hasdenied any wrongdoing.,external Other documents showed how Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired UK property using offshore companies. The files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought 17 properties, including a Â£33m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son, Heydar Aliyev. The leak received little or no coverage in most of the country's media outlets. However, the daily Azerbaijani newspaper Azadliq - which is not accessible inside the country - was leading with the story on its website on Monday. The findings related to British officials were widely reported in UK media. The leaked documents showed how theformer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property in an offshore deal that saved them Â£312,000 in stamp duty. Mrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control. She said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it. They also showed how prominent Conservative Party donorMohamed Amersi worked on a series of controversial dealsfor a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined Â£700m in a US prosecution. Mr Amersi denies any wrongdoing. The Guardian and i newspapers both led with reports about the Pandora Papers on their front pages on Monday. Tony and Cherie Blair BBC Monitoring contributed to this report. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC which has led one of the the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

The Pandora Papers: Political Donors Exposedison BBC One at 19:35 BSTor you can watch back lateron BBC iPlayer(UK only). The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister. Lubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving nearly Â£1.9m since 2012. The Pandora Papers reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money. Her donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. Mrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister. Read our full investigation here. Tony Blair's New Labour received Â£1m from Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston months before coming to power At the start of his premiership, Tony Blair faced criticism over his interactions with Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston. New Labour had received Â£1m from Mr Eccleston months before coming to power in 1997, with another possible chunk on the way. It was later revealed that he had met Mr Blair to lobby him to exempt F1 from a tobacco advertising ban. A ""cash for honours"" scandal hit Tony Blair's government in 2006, when it emerged that a number of large secret loans had been made to the Labour Party before the 2005 general election. Some of the lenders had subsequently been nominated for the House of Lords. Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by the police during an investigation. However, the long and expensive probe led to no charges from the CPS. Offering seats in the House of Lords is still a controversial issue. In 2020Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominated Peter Cruddas- who had given Â£50,000 to Mr Johnson's campaign to be party leader - for a seat in the House of Lords, going against official advice. A businessman who was later convicted for perjury became the Liberal Democrats' largest donor in 2005, giving Â£2.4m to the party. The party faced criticism for not returning the donation,despite Michael Brown not being a registered UK voterand donating through a newly-created company. It's not always wealthy individuals. This summer the police launched aninvestigation into the SNP's financesafter the party had raised money in a crowdfunding drive. Donors had complained about how the money went on to be used. Read morehere. Who got hold of the leaked files? The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) - a nonprofit newsroom and network of journalists based in Washington DC. They led the two-year investigation, codenamed ""Aladdin"". How did the investigation work? More than 140 media organisations and 600 journalists across the world collaborated on the investigation, including the BBC, Le Monde and the Washington Post. They sifted through more than 11.9 million files, following leads across the world. Who led the investigation in the UK? BBC Panorama and the Guardian. Both outlets also led on the previous similar leaks such as the Panama and Paradise Papers. Will the data be made public? The ICIJ is planning on publishing some of the data in November, with the rest to be made public early next year. How does it compare to previous leaks? In recent years, the financial dealings of some of the world's wealthiest and most people have been revealed in leaks such as the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers. The Panama Papers leak in 2016 comprised of 11.5 million files of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, with 2.6 terabytes of data. The Paradise Papers in 2017 contained 13.4 million documents in 1.4 terabytes of data from British Virgin Islands law firm Appleby. The Pandora Papers has files from 14 different offshore service providers, rather than just one firm. Margaret Hodge has campaigned against corruption Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption and Responsible Tax, says ""dirty money has infected our politics"". Sharing an article about businessman Victor Fedotov,she writes on Twitter,external: ""Access and influence is cheap. Our democracy is under threat."" Mr Fedotov - a former oil executive - owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. His businesses have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to 34 Tory MPs and their local parties. Pandora Paper files show he made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read more about the storyhere. We reported earlier that leaked files show a businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. Economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister John Glen was asked about the allegations against former oil executive Victor Fedotov when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme earlier. Mr Glen told the programme he was not familiar with the details of the allegations but ""as I
understand it, that individual has complied with the law in this country"". However, he added: ""Iâm happy to look at it, as any responsible minister in my position with my
responsibilities would."" Mr Fedotov's lawyers say ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he has behaved improperly. You can read more about Mr Fedotov and his links to the Conservatives here. This video can not be played Max
Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, says he hopes the Pandora Papers will spark discussions about greater taxation of the rich. ""Yet again it shows us that thereâs one rule for the rich and
then one rule for ordinary people,"" he tells BBC World News. ""Think of the cost of all of the state interventions for Covid-19,
the impact on the poorest people - we need that money. ""We canât have it tied up
in dusty vaults in the Bahamas, in these secret spaces. We need to liberate
that cash, spend it on schools, spend it on hospitals.â ""We really hope that [leaks] like this continue to push the world
to actually act and stop rich people avoiding tax on this industrial scale,"" he adds. Reality Check A
row has broken out in Pakistan after state television (PTV) wrongly claimed that Junaid Safdar, a grandson of former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, is among 700 Pakistanis named in the Pandora Papers
investigation. Mr
Sharifâs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N), leads the opposition to the
current government. Mr
Sharif himself resigned as prime minister in 2017 in the fallout from a
previous document leak, known as the Panama Papers. State
TV alleged that Mr Safdar had five companies registered in his name, a claim
also tweeted out by an assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan and by another
member of the government. A Twitter account also appeared on Sunday called
âPandoraLeaksâ, containing the claims about Mr Safdar - but itâs nothing to do
with the real Pandora papers. The team of journalists working on the Pandora Papers investigation in Pakistan confirmed to the BBC that Junaid Safdar had not been named in the documents. However, Ali Dar, the son-in-law of Nawaz Sharif, does feature in the list of names contained in the papers. Mr Dar has denied doing anything illegal, and says he is not a resident in Pakistan for tax purposes. The Conservative Party should give back the Â£525,000 donated by Mohamed Amersi after the Pandora Papers revealed he was involved inone of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, says the Labour Party chairwoman. Anneliese Dodds says: ""It's really concerning that the Conservatives have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a man who appears to be closely linked to one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals.
"" She is calling for the party to ""return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access to the prime minister and the chancellor in return for cash"". ""There can't be one rule for senior Conservatives and their chums and another rule for everyone else,"" she says. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine is calling for the Electoral Commission to launch an immediate investigation into these allegations. ""The Tories must comply with this investigation and explain what they are doing to stop the flow of dirty money into the UK and apparently into their own party coffers,"" she says. Boris Johnson earlier said: ""All these donations are vetted in the normal way in accordance with the rules that were set up under a Labour government."" King Abdullah, seen here in 2019, has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 One of the world leaders featured in the Pandora Papers is
the King of Jordan, who used offshore companies to buy a string of properties
in the UK and US worth more than Â£79m ($106m). Abdullah
II bin Al-Hussein's palace says,externalhis 15 homes were bought in this way
""out of security and privacy concerns, and not out of secrecy or an
attempt to hide themâ. So who is the King of Jordan? King Abdullah has been in power for 22 years and is seen as
a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. The 59-year-old rules a countryof 10
million people,externaland has the power to appoint governments and approve
legislation. King Abdullah's sprawling property portfolio built up
between 2003 and 2017. At the same time, he has been accused of presiding over an
authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years amid
austerity measures and tax rises. Jordan isn't a wealthy country and receives international
aid. The British government is one of its biggest financial backers and is
giving Â£650m over five years. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, says: ""It's
just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to achieve a basic level of
home and family, and a good job. ""So to have it really thrown in Jordaniansâ faces that
he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That would look really
bad."" King Abdullah's palace says the properties were âpersonally
fundedâ and international financial assistance is used for public purposes, as
agreed with the donor states. Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018 that he wanted fighting corruption and promoting transparency to be his legacy The Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting been like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed? There's limited coverage of the leak in Kenya,where the family of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The Star newspaper is leading with the story on its website, but others, including the Standard and the People Daily newspapers, did
not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. The country's leading daily newspaper, The Nation, published a story written by a news agency with the headline ""Pandora
Papers expose leaders' offshore millions"", using a picture of Jordan's
king. The story includes four lines about the Kenyattas. In Jordan -  where the Pandora Papers revealed thatKing Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US - stories on the leak were also notably absent; observers say local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. On Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately owned al-Ghad, al-Dustour andJordan Times,externalnewspapers were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Read more here. Governments in at least eight countries have announced investigations into the financial activities of both citizens and institutions following thePandora Papers revelations.,external Officials in Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Australia and Panama are promising inquiries, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported.,external The ICIJ is the organisation that obtained the data leak and shared it with media partners around the world, including the BBC. The UK has not announced a formal investigation, but, earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""HMRC (HM Revenue & Customs) will look through those [documents] to see if there is anything we can learn."" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a statementfollowing the revelation that his family secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The president says he is currently abroad and will give a comprehensive response when he returns. However, he adds that the Pandora Papers will ""go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe"". ""The movement of illicit funds, proceeds of crime and corruption thrive in an environment of secrecy and darkness,"" the statement says. ""The Pandora Papers and subsequent follow up audits will lift that veil of secrecy and darkness for those who can not explain their assets or wealth."" We've been bringing you the latest revelations from the Pandora Papers since the findings of the huge financial information leak was broadcast by the BBC and media organisations across the world yesterday. Here's what we've learned today:  Ecuadorâs president Guillermo Lasso  is insisting all of his investments are legal after the Pandora Papers revealed he operated through 14 offshore companies,most of them based in Panama. The companies were closed only after the leftist government of
Rafael Correa passed a law banning candidates from being the beneficial owners
of companies located in tax havens, according to El Universo newspaper, which
is part of the consortium digging into the Pandora Papers. According to the investigation, Mr Lasso -  a former banker who took office
earlier this year - replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments
to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017,
before becoming a presidential candidate. Reacting to the revelations, the president says 10 of the
offshore companies mentioned were already inactive, while he denies involvement
with the other four. He says all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, are
legal. Youâll see the term âoffshoreâ in many of our stories about the Pandora Papers. This is because the papers have revealed complicated networks of companies that have been set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets, such as houses.For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries - or âoffshoreâ. There are several legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries - including protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments.Although having secretive offshore assets isnât illegal in itself, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality.Loopholes in the law also allow people tolegallyavoid paying some taxes by moving their money to or setting up companies in these places - sometimes called tax havens. While not illegal, itâs often seen as unethical. The Pandora Papers investigation is the largest ever organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists â theyâre the group that looked into a string of other leaks you mightâve heard of including theFinCen Files(2020),ParadisePapers (2017) andPanamaPapers (2016). âThereâs never been anything on this scale,â says Fergus Shiel, the ICIJâs managing editor.âIt shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" And his colleague Gerard Ryle says: âWe are talking about some of the most famous people in the world that are in these documents. Presidents, prime ministers, government ministersâ¦ âWeâre not looking at a couple of million dollars here. Weâre looking at trillions of dollars.â A businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal, the leaked Pandora Papers show. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. The BBC investigation into the files shows he secretly benefitted from the alleged $4bn fraud in Russia. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read the full storyhere. Most income comes in the form of donations, including those from individuals and companies. To give money as an individual you have to appear on a UK electoral register. Companies must be registered in the UK and carry out business in the country. Other sources of income for parties include membership fees, loans and a limited amount of public money. A vast majority of the Conservative Party's donations come from individuals: 68% during the 2019 election campaign. The Labour Party's income looks different. During the 2019 general election campaign, 93% of donations came from trade unions. National parties only have to record donations above Â£7,500, so the totals don't pick up the large base of Labour supporters who give small amounts.

"Adele's last high-profile appearance was as host of NBC's Saturday Night Live almost a year ago Adele has heightened speculation that she is about to release her first new music since 2015, after updating her website and social media pages. The star's Twitter and Instagram images were changed to a blue and turquoise pattern, while her old website was scrubbed and replaced with a link urging fans to sign up for information. It comes after the number 30 was projected onto several buildings around the world over the weekend. Fans are predicting this will be the name of her fourth album - after 19, 21 and 25. The mysterious projections have been spotted on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, Amsterdam's Nemo Museum and New York's Empire State Building. The logo has also reportedly appeared in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, South Korea and the UK. Although they have not officially been confirmed as being linked to Adele, the images appear to use the font she has favoured on her previous albums. Allow Twitter content?

The singer hinted that her fourth album would be called 30 in a 2019 Instagram post,jokingly telling fans,external: ""30 will be a drum and bass record to spite you all."" Using the title would also connect the album to Adele's previous pattern of naming records after a pivotal year in her life. She has previously said she would retire the system, saying that she had settled into family life. But the singer separated from her ex-husband Simon Konecki when she was 30 (she is now 33) and has subsequently kept a low public profile. The one exception was a stint hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live last year.

""I know there's been a lot of chatter about me just being the host. Like, 'Why isn't she the musical guest?' and stuff like that,"" she said. ""And there's a couple of reasons. My album's not finished, and I'm also too scared to do bothâ¦ I'd rather just put on some wigs, have a glass of wine or six and just see what happens."" Fraser T Smith, who co-wrote Adele's global smash hit Set Fire To The Rain, recently told the BBC he ""didn't know"" whether the star's new album was complete. ""Adele is incredibly secretive, and I think that that's the way you want it - building that suspense,"" he said. ""A testament to her is that you just don't know the next direction she'll take.

The Pandora Papers: Political Donors Exposedison BBC One at 19:35 BSTor you can watch back lateron BBC iPlayer(UK only). The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister. Lubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving nearly Â£1.9m since 2012. The Pandora Papers reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money. Her donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. Mrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister. Read our full investigation here. Tony Blair's New Labour received Â£1m from Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston months before coming to power At the start of his premiership, Tony Blair faced criticism over his interactions with Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston. New Labour had received Â£1m from Mr Eccleston months before coming to power in 1997, with another possible chunk on the way. It was later revealed that he had met Mr Blair to lobby him to exempt F1 from a tobacco advertising ban. A ""cash for honours"" scandal hit Tony Blair's government in 2006, when it emerged that a number of large secret loans had been made to the Labour Party before the 2005 general election. Some of the lenders had subsequently been nominated for the House of Lords. Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by the police during an investigation. However, the long and expensive probe led to no charges from the CPS. Offering seats in the House of Lords is still a controversial issue. In 2020Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominated Peter Cruddas- who had given Â£50,000 to Mr Johnson's campaign to be party leader - for a seat in the House of Lords, going against official advice. A businessman who was later convicted for perjury became the Liberal Democrats' largest donor in 2005, giving Â£2.4m to the party. The party faced criticism for not returning the donation,despite Michael Brown not being a registered UK voterand donating through a newly-created company. It's not always wealthy individuals. This summer the police launched aninvestigation into the SNP's financesafter the party had raised money in a crowdfunding drive. Donors had complained about how the money went on to be used.

They led the two-year investigation, codenamed ""Aladdin"". How did the investigation work? More than 140 media organisations and 600 journalists across the world collaborated on the investigation, including the BBC, Le Monde and the Washington Post. They sifted through more than 11.9 million files, following leads across the world. Who led the investigation in the UK? BBC Panorama and the Guardian. Both outlets also led on the previous similar leaks such as the Panama and Paradise Papers. Will the data be made public? The ICIJ is planning on publishing some of the data in November, with the rest to be made public early next year. How does it compare to previous leaks? In recent years, the financial dealings of some of the world's wealthiest and most people have been revealed in leaks such as the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers. The Panama Papers leak in 2016 comprised of 11.5 million files of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, with 2.6 terabytes of data. The Paradise Papers in 2017 contained 13.4 million documents in 1.4 terabytes of data from British Virgin Islands law firm Appleby. The Pandora Papers has files from 14 different offshore service providers, rather than just one firm. Margaret Hodge has campaigned against corruption Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption and Responsible Tax, says ""dirty money has infected our politics"". Sharing an article about businessman Victor Fedotov,she writes on Twitter,external: ""Access and influence is cheap. Our democracy is under threat."" Mr Fedotov - a former oil executive - owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. His businesses have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to 34 Tory MPs and their local parties. Pandora Paper files show he made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read more about the storyhere. We reported earlier that leaked files show a businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. Economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister John Glen was asked about the allegations against former oil executive Victor Fedotov when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme earlier. Mr Glen told the programme he was not familiar with the details of the allegations but ""as I
understand it, that individual has complied with the law in this country"". However, he added: ""Iâm happy to look at it, as any responsible minister in my position with my
responsibilities would."" Mr Fedotov's lawyers say ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he has behaved improperly. You can read more about Mr Fedotov and his links to the Conservatives here. This video can not be played Max
Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, says he hopes the Pandora Papers will spark discussions about greater taxation of the rich. ""Yet again it shows us that thereâs one rule for the rich and
then one rule for ordinary people,"" he tells BBC World News. ""Think of the cost of all of the state interventions for Covid-19,
the impact on the poorest people - we need that money. ""We canât have it tied up
in dusty vaults in the Bahamas, in these secret spaces. We need to liberate
that cash, spend it on schools, spend it on hospitals.â ""We really hope that [leaks] like this continue to push the world
to actually act and stop rich people avoiding tax on this industrial scale,"" he adds. Reality Check A
row has broken out in Pakistan after state television (PTV) wrongly claimed that Junaid Safdar, a grandson of former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, is among 700 Pakistanis named in the Pandora Papers
investigation. Mr
Sharifâs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N), leads the opposition to the
current government. Mr
Sharif himself resigned as prime minister in 2017 in the fallout from a
previous document leak, known as the Panama Papers. State
TV alleged that Mr Safdar had five companies registered in his name, a claim
also tweeted out by an assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan and by another
member of the government. A Twitter account also appeared on Sunday called
âPandoraLeaksâ, containing the claims about Mr Safdar - but itâs nothing to do
with the real Pandora papers. The team of journalists working on the Pandora Papers investigation in Pakistan confirmed to the BBC that Junaid Safdar had not been named in the documents. However, Ali Dar, the son-in-law of Nawaz Sharif, does feature in the list of names contained in the papers. Mr Dar has denied doing anything illegal, and says he is not a resident in Pakistan for tax purposes. The Conservative Party should give back the Â£525,000 donated by Mohamed Amersi after the Pandora Papers revealed he was involved inone of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, says the Labour Party chairwoman. Anneliese Dodds says: ""It's really concerning that the Conservatives have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a man who appears to be closely linked to one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals.
"" She is calling for the party to ""return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access to the prime minister and the chancellor in return for cash"". ""There can't be one rule for senior Conservatives and their chums and another rule for everyone else,"" she says. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine is calling for the Electoral Commission to launch an immediate investigation into these allegations. ""The Tories must comply with this investigation and explain what they are doing to stop the flow of dirty money into the UK and apparently into their own party coffers,"" she says. Boris Johnson earlier said: ""All these donations are vetted in the normal way in accordance with the rules that were set up under a Labour government."" King Abdullah, seen here in 2019, has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 One of the world leaders featured in the Pandora Papers is
the King of Jordan, who used offshore companies to buy a string of properties
in the UK and US worth more than Â£79m ($106m). Abdullah
II bin Al-Hussein's palace says,externalhis 15 homes were bought in this way
""out of security and privacy concerns, and not out of secrecy or an
attempt to hide themâ. So who is the King of Jordan? King Abdullah has been in power for 22 years and is seen as
a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. The 59-year-old rules a countryof 10
million people,externaland has the power to appoint governments and approve
legislation. King Abdullah's sprawling property portfolio built up
between 2003 and 2017. At the same time, he has been accused of presiding over an
authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years amid
austerity measures and tax rises. Jordan isn't a wealthy country and receives international
aid. The British government is one of its biggest financial backers and is
giving Â£650m over five years. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, says: ""It's
just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to achieve a basic level of
home and family, and a good job. ""So to have it really thrown in Jordaniansâ faces that
he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That would look really
bad."" King Abdullah's palace says the properties were âpersonally
fundedâ and international financial assistance is used for public purposes, as
agreed with the donor states. Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018 that he wanted fighting corruption and promoting transparency to be his legacy The Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting been like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed? There's limited coverage of the leak in Kenya,where the family of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The Star newspaper is leading with the story on its website, but others, including the Standard and the People Daily newspapers, did
not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. The country's leading daily newspaper, The Nation, published a story written by a news agency with the headline ""Pandora
Papers expose leaders' offshore millions"", using a picture of Jordan's
king. The story includes four lines about the Kenyattas. In Jordan -  where the Pandora Papers revealed thatKing Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US - stories on the leak were also notably absent; observers say local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. On Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately owned al-Ghad, al-Dustour andJordan Times,externalnewspapers were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Read more here. Governments in at least eight countries have announced investigations into the financial activities of both citizens and institutions following thePandora Papers revelations.,external Officials in Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Australia and Panama are promising inquiries, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported.,external The ICIJ is the organisation that obtained the data leak and shared it with media partners around the world, including the BBC. The UK has not announced a formal investigation, but, earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""HMRC (HM Revenue & Customs) will look through those [documents] to see if there is anything we can learn."" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a statementfollowing the revelation that his family secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The president says he is currently abroad and will give a comprehensive response when he returns. However, he adds that the Pandora Papers will ""go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe"". ""The movement of illicit funds, proceeds of crime and corruption thrive in an environment of secrecy and darkness,"" the statement says. ""The Pandora Papers and subsequent follow up audits will lift that veil of secrecy and darkness for those who can not explain their assets or wealth."" We've been bringing you the latest revelations from the Pandora Papers since the findings of the huge financial information leak was broadcast by the BBC and media organisations across the world yesterday. Here's what we've learned today:  Ecuadorâs president Guillermo Lasso  is insisting all of his investments are legal after the Pandora Papers revealed he operated through 14 offshore companies,most of them based in Panama. The companies were closed only after the leftist government of
Rafael Correa passed a law banning candidates from being the beneficial owners
of companies located in tax havens, according to El Universo newspaper, which
is part of the consortium digging into the Pandora Papers. According to the investigation, Mr Lasso -  a former banker who took office
earlier this year - replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments
to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017,
before becoming a presidential candidate. Reacting to the revelations, the president says 10 of the
offshore companies mentioned were already inactive, while he denies involvement
with the other four. He says all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, are
legal. Youâll see the term âoffshoreâ in many of our stories about the Pandora Papers. This is because the papers have revealed complicated networks of companies that have been set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets, such as houses.For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries - or âoffshoreâ. There are several legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries - including protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments.Although having secretive offshore assets isnât illegal in itself, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality.Loopholes in the law also allow people tolegallyavoid paying some taxes by moving their money to or setting up companies in these places - sometimes called tax havens. While not illegal, itâs often seen as unethical. The Pandora Papers investigation is the largest ever organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists â theyâre the group that looked into a string of other leaks you mightâve heard of including theFinCen Files(2020),ParadisePapers (2017) andPanamaPapers (2016). âThereâs never been anything on this scale,â says Fergus Shiel, the ICIJâs managing editor.âIt shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" And his colleague Gerard Ryle says: âWe are talking about some of the most famous people in the world that are in these documents. Presidents, prime ministers, government ministersâ¦ âWeâre not looking at a couple of million dollars here. Weâre looking at trillions of dollars.â A businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal, the leaked Pandora Papers show. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. The BBC investigation into the files shows he secretly benefitted from the alleged $4bn fraud in Russia. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read the full storyhere. Most income comes in the form of donations, including those from individuals and companies. To give money as an individual you have to appear on a UK electoral register. Companies must be registered in the UK and carry out business in the country. Other sources of income for parties include membership fees, loans and a limited amount of public money. A vast majority of the Conservative Party's donations come from individuals: 68% during the 2019 election campaign. The Labour Party's income looks different. During the 2019 general election campaign, 93% of donations came from trade unions. National parties only have to record donations above Â£7,500, so the totals don't pick up the large base of Labour supporters who give small amounts.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""Our recovery comes with a cost"" Rishi Sunak has told Conservative party members that future tax cuts are conditional on repairing the UK's public finances after Covid. In his first conference speech as chancellor, he said he wanted lower taxes - but funding the pandemic recovery ""comes with a cost"". Vowing that ""we need to fix our public finances"", he said allowing borrowing to rise further would be ""immoral"". The comments come three weeks before his autumn Budget on 27 October. He also told party delegates that leaving the EU was in the UK's long-term interests, despite current disruption to fuel and food supplies. And he added he was ""proud"" to have backed Brexit, in spite of warnings before the 2016 referendum it could end his political career. PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit Sunak: No magic wand to solve supply problems Mr Sunak's speech comes amid a difficult backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside supply chain disruption caused by a shortage of lorry drivers. The government has so far rejected demands from the haulage industry for it to increase the 5,000 temporary visas it plans for foreign drivers to plug shortfalls. In his speech, Mr Sunak insisted that despite ""challenges"", Brexit would foster a ""culture of enterprise"" and help the UK adapt to the modern world. He also defendedraising taxesto pay for the NHS and social care, insisting that it would be ""irresponsible"" to pay for investment with higher borrowing instead. He told delegates the country should be grateful for ""sound Conservative management"" of the economy by his predecessors since 2010. And whilst he acknowledged tax rises were unpopular and perceived as ""un-Conservative"", he said they were a better option than more debt. ""I'll tell you what is un-Conservative: Unfunded pledges, reckless borrowing, and soaring debt,"" he added. ""Yes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that, our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing."" There was no whizz-bangery in the chancellor's speech - no cranking of the huge economic levers on tax or spending, no huge headline grabbing policy. And, a little like Rishi Sunak himself, it was quite short. (He made a little joke about his stature himself...) This felt like the first draft of Sunak-ism: where the chancellor has come from, what he's all about, where he might go in the future, to an audience where many will wonder if he might one day be prime minister. There were repeated references to his time in California, that spot so often associated with sunshine and innovation. After the public spending splurges of the pandemic, he portrayed himself as a traditional Conservative: cautious in how taxpayers' money is spent, drawn to cut taxes when he can - even though he's put them up. This hoodie-wearing chancellor - although he did wear a suit for his speech - made 16 references to the ""future,"" including the line ""the future is here."" Whom could he have been referring to? Against the backdrop of the withdrawal of aÂ£20-a-week universal credit top-up, Mr Sunak also attacked Labour - which opposes the cut - for wanting struggling families to ""lean ever more on the state"". ""Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?,"" he asked, adding: ""Be in no doubt, that is the essence of the Labour answer"". ""Not only does Labour's approach not work in practice, it is a desperately sad vision for our future."" ""But there is an alternative. An approach focused on good work, better skills, and higher wages."" Mr Sunak also announced the government would give funding to double the number of Turing research fellows investigating the potential of artificial intelligence. He also committed Â£500m to renew job support programmes set up during the Covid pandemic, after the end of the furlough scheme last month. The Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022. And the JETS scheme, which helps long-term unemployed people on universal credit, will be prolonged until September 2022. The Treasury said that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review, which will take place alongside the Budget later this month.

"This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" Insulate Britain protesters have been confronted by angry drivers as the group blocked more roads in London. Police arrested 38 climate change activists near the Blackwall Tunnel entrance during the morning rush hour. One driver confronted the demonstrators saying she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital. ""How can you be so selfish?"" she asked. Insulate Britain defended its tactics, saying disruptive direct action was effective and led to policy change. In a video captured by LBC,external, the driver said her mother was ""in the ambulance"", saying, ""She's going to the hospital in Canterbury. Do you think I'm stupid?"" ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass,"" she added. Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory were also targeted. It follows recent protests on the M25 and M4. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The Blackwall Tunnel is the latest river crossing to be targeted In other footage shared byTalk Radio,external, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. London Ambulance Service have also appealed to Insulate Britain to let their drivers pass. A spokesperson said: ""Ultimately, a delay to us reaching someone who needs our care can cost lives. We would ask any protesters to please allow our crews to pass to ensure we are able to reach people who need our help as quickly as possible."" Another driver held up was Dr Malik Saleh, a dentist who was stuck at the Hanger Lane gyratory. He said the protest had caused ""a crazy amount of inconvenience"" and that he had to cancel his appointments. ""The point is valid but there must be a better way around it,"" he said. A father, who wanted to be identified only as Will, said he was worried his 15-year-old autistic daughter, who has stress-related epilepsy, could have a seizure brought on by the fear of missing school, after she was stuck in the traffic for 45 minutes. He said the ""beeping and shouting"" did not help because of her sensory problems and she did not have her ear-defenders. ""If she does carry on stressing out at school today it will bring on a seizure. These protesters don't realise the consequences of their actions at all, and who it affects."" Ministers plan to enact tougher powers to tackle their direct action which has seen blockages to key arteries around London, including on the M25 and M4. Last month,the government won a High Court injunction, warning climate change protesters they could be jailed if they continued their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested since the group's demonstrations started last month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A reference by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ""Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days"" was met with boos at a fringe Maritime UK drinks reception at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday evening. Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes. Responding to criticism of the disruption caused to drivers, spokesman Craig Scudder said current government policies did not go far enough and disruptive action worked. He told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Mr Scudder said Insulate Britain had a policy of allowing blue light emergency vehicles to pass its roadblocks and the group provided video footage of activists moving to accommodate ambulances and medical cars. The government has said it is investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

"Russia's Vladimir Putin (left), Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev (centre) and the King of Jordan (right) are all linked to the files Several world leaders have denied wrongdoing after featuring in a huge leak of financial documents from offshore companies. Dubbed the Pandora Papers, the 12 million files constitute the biggest such leak in history. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Jordan's King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein are among some 35 current and former leaders linked to the files. Both have issued statements saying they have done nothing wrong. Jordan's royal palace said it was ""not unusual nor improper"" that King Abdullah owned property abroad. Leaked documents showthe leader secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US since taking power in 1999. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov meanwhile questioned the reliability of the ""unsubstantiated"" information, after it detailed hidden wealth linked to President Putin and members of his inner circle. ""For now it is just not clear what this information is and what it is about,"" he told reporters, adding that ""we didn't see any hidden wealth of Putin's inner circle in there"". LIVE: Follow reactions to the leak A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak How the world is reporting leaks on powerful leaders The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. This video can not be played 'One rule for the rich, another for ordinary people' Other leaders linked to the leak include: Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who allegedly failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for Â£12m in the south of France Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who - along with six members of his family - has been linked to 13 offshore companies Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a billionaire businessman, who is accused of selling a copper and iron mine in an environmentally sensitive area to a childhood friend,as detailed in Spain's El Pais newspaper,external AndAzerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, whose family and close associates have allegedly been secretly involved in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m In a tweet thread, the Czech prime minister said the allegations are an attempt to influence elections scheduled for this week and insisted he has ""never done anything wrong or illegal"". Mr Kenyatta said the investigation ""will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe"", and promised to ""respond comprehensively"" to the leak once he returned from a state visit abroad. The Pandora Papers show no evidence that the Kenyatta family stole or hid state assets in their offshore companies. And a statement from Mr PiÃ±era's office said he denied taking part in or having any information on the sale of the Dominga mining project. President Aliyev and his family did not respond to attempts to contact them,according to The Guardian,external.

"Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. It blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email. The services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday. But the company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". Sheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building"" to work out what had gone wrong. In a statement,Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools,externaland systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. Many found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. According to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Many outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country. This outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs. The length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of ""mayhem"" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem. Interesting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem.

"Craig has starred in five Bond films Daniel Craig's final film as James Bond has notched up the highest opening weekend UK takings of any 007 movie. Craig's fifth outing as 007 made Â£25.9m between Friday and Sunday, according to box office trackers Comscore. It beat Skyfall's first weekend takings of Â£20.2m and Spectre's Â£19.8m. Those films sit at numbers two and three in the all-time UK box office chart. Many in the industry are hoping No Time to Die will kickstart the box office after cinemas shut during the pandemic. It was directed by US film-maker Cary Joji Fukunaga and also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. Most critics praised the film, with many giving five-star reviews after its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this week. But some suggested the movie did not quite justify its 163-minute running time. Universal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019. When Skyfall made its big screen debut nine years ago, it opened in 587 cinemas. Focus will soon switch to how No Time to Die performs on the other side of the Atlantic when the film opens there on 8 October. Other major countries yet to experience 007's latest adventures include France, Russia, China and Australia, with release global dates scheduled for later this month and November. The box office market in the US and Canada currently appears to be in rude health, with Venom: Let There Be Carnage taking $90.1m (Â£66.3m) on its debut this weekend, setting a new pandemic-era record. The supervillain sequel starring Tom Hardy also beat the original film's first weekend haul of $80.1m in 2018.

"A businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal, leaked files show. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. A BBC investigation shows he secretly benefitted from the alleged $4bn fraud in Russia. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. The revelations come from the Pandora Papers, a leak of 11.9 million offshore files obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). An investigation of the documents in the UK has been led by BBC Panorama and The Guardian . The BBC discovered documents revealing Mr Fedotov as a secret owner of a company called VNIIST that benefitted from hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts from Transneft, the Russian state-owned oil and gas pipeline company. Why are party donations often so controversial? A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Secret wealth of leaders exposed in document leak A 2008 audit report suggested Transneft had lost huge sums to corruption and that one of the contractors that had benefitted was VNIIST. It was alleged VNIIST was paid for work it hadn't carried out and that Transneft had lost around $143 million in just two contracts. The audit report was leaked to Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny who estimated $4bn had been embezzled. No charges were brought against any of those involved. What the audit report did not reveal was that one of Mr Fedotov's secret business partners in VNIIST was the President of Transneft, Semyon Vainshtok. The documents in the Pandora Papers show he was secretly benefitting from contracts Transneft had awarded. They reveal a scheme to funnel profits from the Transneft deals through layers of companies in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and the British Virgin Islands under the ownership of trusts of which Mr Fedotov and Mr Vainshtok were secret beneficiaries. A second Transneft executive was also profiting from the cash. The files show millions of dollars flowing into the trusts and that by 2007 Mr Fedotov's trust held some $97m in assets. The evidence suggests some of the money from Transneft ended up paying for Mr Fedotov's Â£7m house in the English countryside. Andrew Mitchell QC told Panorama the scheme appeared to be ""a pure attempt to slice money out of government and, when you factor in that the CEO of the government-owned entity organised and did the subcontracting with a couple of mates, um, that's fraud."" Mr Vainshtok's lawyers said the allegations of fraud were ""unfounded"" and made for ""political purposes"". They said: ""The allegations were investigated at the time by the Audit Committee of Russia, the Ministry of Interior Affairs of Russia and the General Prosecutor's office in Russia, who all found that there was no basis for making the allegations, and no grounds to take any action against our client."" Mr Fedotov's lawyers said the 2008 audit report is not an official reliable document and that he denies any allegation of wrongdoing. Mr Fedotov bought Aragon Hall in Hampshire for Â£7m But it is not just property that Mr Fedotov has funded in the UK. His money has funded the Conservative Party. Last year Mr Fedotov was revealed to be the owner of Aquind, the company behind a Â£1.24bn project to build an electricity cable linking the UK to France. Aquind is currently seeking UK government approval for the project and a decision will be made in weeks. His connection to Aquind has been hidden through an exemption to UK company laws granted to people with personal security concerns. Mr Fedotov is now identified on the company's public records, alongside Alexander Temerko, the Ukraine-born public face and part owner of Aquind. Mr Temerko is a Conservative Party activist and personal friend of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He is a regular at Conservative Party fundraisers and has personally donated more than Â£700,000 to the party. Research by the BBC has established that in addition to Mr Temerko's donations to the Conservative Party, Mr Fedotov's businesses have donated another Â£700,000 to 34 MPs and their local parties since the Aquind project began. Aquind's relationship with the Conservative Party does not end there. Lord Callanan, currently a business minister responsible for corporate responsibility, is a former director of the company, while former minister Lord James Wharton took up a role as a paid adviser when he lost his House of Commons seat in 2017. In an interview for the BBC, journalist Peter Oborne says this raises questions about Aquind. He says ""You have to ask yourself why â¦ Aquind feels it needs to go to such elaborate efforts and spend such money and so much time to get access to the Conservative Party."" A Conservative spokesman said donations are properly and transparently declared and the party ""perform compliance checks in line with the â¦ legislation and requirements enacted by the last Labour government"". The spokesman said ""Fund raising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. Government policy is in no way influenced by the donations the Party receives"" and that the party is ""motivated by the priorities of the British public, acting in the national interest"" Lawyers for Aquind and Mr Temerko said their donations were ""entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment"". They said there was ""no evidence that funds were embezzled"" from Transneft. Mr Fedotov ""denies any allegation of wrongdoing"" and says that he ""has never had any interest in British politics and has operated in an open and transparent manner throughout the course of his career."" Aquind announced its plan to build an electricity cable under the English Channel in 2016. The proposed route starts at an electricity substation in Lovedean, near Portsmouth, and ends up near Le Havre in Normandy, France. It is not the first of its kind. Another cable was laid undersea between the two countries in 1986. But if the new one comes online, it is expected to provide two gigawatts to the UK National Grid, enough to power four million homes. Locals protesting against the project claim the construction will destroy allotments and wildlife habitats. Residents in Portsmouth protested against the construction of the Aquind Interconnector Local MP Penny Mordaunt has joined them, delivering a petition to the government in June, calling for the proposals to be rejected by the government. She has said it would be ""strategically wrong"" to go ahead with a project that would make the UK ""reliant on another country [France] to power us"". Stephen Morgan, Labour MP for Portsmouth South, is worried about the inclusion of communications and data cables as part of the underwater connector. He has said that having these cables that are ""available for hire by third-party clientsâ¦raises similar concerns to those about the UK's 5G network and Huawei"". The company submitted its plans in 2019 and the decision now sits with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. His predecessor Alok Sharma recused himself from the decision following revelations he had shared a table with Mr Temerko at a Conservative fundraising event. Former energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan also recused herself after her local party group received several donations from Aquind and Mr Temerko. In 2019 Conservative MP David Morris was found to have breached parliamentary rules when he spoke in favour of Aquind in the House of Commons, only weeks after having received a Â£10,000 donation from the company. Gavin Millar QC, an elections expert, said: ""The question is: if you're a political party in government, why aren't you recognizing the risk that there's a connection between the money you're receiving and the person who's giving that money?â¯""â¯ He added: ""It's in their interests not to look too hard. And it's lucrative to not look hard if you're good at raising the money."" In a statement, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) told the BBC Lord Callanan has recused himself from any decisions relating to Aquind. A spokesperson for the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""The Secretary of State is currently considering the Planning Inspectorate's report on the application for development consent for the proposed project. ""No decision has yet been taken. The decision will be made solely by the Secretary of State who has a quasi-judicial role in determining this planning application."" The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC which has led the biggest ever global investigation.More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

"The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister. Lubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving more than Â£1.8m since 2012. Leaked documents reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money. Her donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. Mrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister. But until now, very little has been known about the Chernukhins' wealth and where it comes from. Why are party donations often so controversial? A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks World leaders deny wrongdoing after Pandora leaks The documents in the Pandora Papers leak of internal files and correspondence from offshore financial firms show the couple are linked to a network of 32 companies, three trusts and more than Â£100m in assets. The documents indicate that Mrs Chernukhin's wealth comes from her husband, with one email describing her as being ""financially supported by her husband"", and another as ""a housewife"". One document shows Mr Chernukhin's offshore company loaned Â£4m to his wife's UK company. The latest revelations follow separate allegations about two businessmen linked to donations to the party. Mohammed Amersi, who had given nearly Â£525,000 to the Tories since 2018,was involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals that resulted in a telecoms company being fined $965m (Â£700m) in a US prosecution Abusinessman whose companies donated to 34 Conservative MPsis alleged to have made millions from one of Russia's largest fraud scandals. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov is the owner of a company behind a controversial infrastructure project in the English Channel, which is currently awaiting UK government approval Both men deny any wrongdoing. Working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has had access to almost 12 million documents files from 14 companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Cyprus and Switzerland. The Conservative Party say all donations have been properly and lawfully declared and followed all the rules. Asked about the revelations about party donors that have emerged from the Pandora Papers investigation, the prime minister said all party donations are ""'vetted in the normal way in accordance with rules set up by the Labour government"", adding:  ""So we vet them the whole time"". The main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years. Meanwhile, in response to the claims, Transparency International UK says that vetting process for all political donors in the UK is ""little more than a box-ticking exercise"". ""It's easy to evade the rules or not look too closely. We must do better,"" they add. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said HM Revenue & Customs will examine the leaked papers ""to see if there's anything we can learn"". The Russian-born Chernukhins are both now British citizens. Pandora Papers documents reveal how they secretly acquired properties in the UK through offshore companies. They purchased a house overlooking Regents Park in London now worth Â£38m, as well as a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for Â£10m. Mr Chernukhin, 52, a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president. The Pandora Papers investigation found evidence that suggests Mr Chernukhin abused his position as the government appointed head of a state bank to advance his private business interests. In evidence to a court hearing in London in 2018, Mr Chernukhin testified how he had reached an arrangement with the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, to secure planning permission for a development he had a secret personal interest in. In return Mr Chernukhin told the court he proposed helping the mayor in relation to two other development sites in Moscow in which his bank had an interest. He told the court: ""As a part of negotiations or agreement with them how to proceed, we agreed...â¯that I will help them"", ""and Mr Luzhkov will help me"".â¯ Andrew Mitchell QC, a leading corruption barrister, told Panorama: ""That's a conflict, there's no two ways about it. Here is a man who's chairman of the bank, using the bank as a mean by which he enhances his own personal wealth. And that has corruption written all over it."" Pandora Papers files also show Mr Chernukhin has carried on doing business with people close to the Kremlin. They reveal his secret involvement in a property deal in St Petersburg in 2017, in which his partner was the wife of a then Russian government minister. He sold his stake in the property the following year for $30m, the documents show. Questioned in 2018 about the Chernukhin's wealth, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - said ""all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made"" on donations. Asked whether the donations to the Conservatives should be declared as coming from Mr Chernukhin as well, political law expert Gavin Millar QC said: ""If it's joint money, if it's family money, why isn't he willing to have his name alongside hers in the quarterly return to the Electoral Commission, publicly identified as a donor, and the source of the money?"" He added: ""When you've got somebody who's a prominent associate of people who are connected with the Kremlin andâ¦ with Russian government, you would have thought any British political partyâ¦ would start to investigate it and ask why that money is being given."" Lawyers for the Chernukhins said Panorama's interpretation of the court case involving Mr Chernukhin was a ""gross mis-characterisation"". They said ""the suggestion that he acted improperly whilst an official of the state is wholly untrue"" and he ""has not accumulated his wealth.... in a corrupt manner"". The lawyers said it was not accepted that any of Mrs Chernukhin's political donations have been funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both said the Tories should return themoney donated by Mohamed Amersi. Investigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated the businessman was involved in negotiations for Swedish telecoms company Telia that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company controlled by the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. The payment was described by the US authorities as a ""$220m bribe"". Mr Amersi has denied wrongdoing and his lawyers said the offshore company had been ""vetted and approved by Telia"" and that its involvement ""did not raise any red flags"" to him. Representatives for Mr Amersi said on Monday he had ""never knowingly facilitated corrupt transactions"" and the Pandora Papers reports sought to ""embarrass the Conservative Party"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""The Electoral Commission should launch an immediate investigation into these allegations."" The Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were ""concerning"". Referring to comments by Mr Amersi earlier this year that high-spending donors have been able to gain meetings with the prime minister and chancellor, she added: ""The Conservatives should return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access"". Elsewhere, the Russian government has dismissed allegations of financial impropriety involving President Putin contained in the documents leak. Other world leaders,including Jordan's King Abdullah, and the Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, have also rejected allegations concerning the secret purchase of properties using offshore companies. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government will investigatecitizens linked to the leak. Hundreds of Pakistanis, including members of Mr Khan's cabinet, are said to have had secretly moved wealth through offshore companies. Update 3 December 2021:  Following publication, Mr and Mrs Chernukhin have made legal complaints about this article.  They say that the article is defamatory of them. In their complaint, they have told the BBC that no deal (corrupt or otherwise) was ultimately concluded with Mayor Luzhkov in respect of the properties in Moscow. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

"A prominent Tory donor who contributed to Boris Johnson's leadership campaign was involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, a BBC investigation has discovered. Mohamed Amersi has given nearly Â£525,000 to the party since 2018. Leaked documents reveal how he worked on a series of controversial deals for a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined $965m (Â£700m) in a US prosecution. Mr Amersi denies any wrongdoing. The 61-year-old is a corporate lawyer who worked as a consultant for Telia between 2007 and 2013. Working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has obtained documents that show how Mr Amersi was involved in a controversial $220m payment to a secretive offshore company in 2010. The firm was controlled by Gulnara Karimova - the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan - and the payment was described by the US authorities as a ""$220m bribe"". Mr Amersi's lawyers said the offshore company had been ""vetted and approved by Telia"" and that its involvement ""did not raise any red flags"" to him. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Questions about the sources of Mr Amersi's wealth come as the Conservative Party's annual conference is under way in Manchester. His donations have included more than Â£100,000 towards the 2019 general election campaign and Â£10,000 to the prime minister's leadership bid. Mr Amersi's Russian-born partner, Nadezhda Rodicheva, has also donated money to the Conservatives - more than Â£250,000 in 2017 and 2018. Political law expert Gavin Millar QC believes the Conservatives should return the money. ""I think they should give it backâ¦ if serious questions are being asked about the donor,"" he said. But Mr Millar added ""the bottom line is they don't have to, and there's nothing in the law or the regulation of our system that compels them to do that"". The main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years. Why are donations to political parties often so controversial? At the moment individual donors only need to be on the UK electoral register. Once a party has checked that, they can accept as much money as they like. Mr Millar said: ""You would have thoughtâ¦ that there should be some sort of obligation placed on them in law, to enquire a little bit into where that large sum of money comes from. In recent months, Mr Amersi has been drawn into a ""cash for access"" row centred around claims that high-spending Tory donors were able to gain regular meetings with the prime minister and chancellor. A company owned by Gulnara Karimova was linked to the deal Mr Amersi's name is featured in a leak of almost 12 million documents and files known as the Pandora Papers. They detail the workings of offshore financial firms in locations including the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Singapore. On Sunday, the BBC revealed how documents showed the King of Jordan amassed a secret property empire, and the Azerbaijani president and his associates have been involved in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m. The leaked documents also showed how the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property for Â£6.45 million in an offshore deal that saved them Â£312,000 in stamp duty. The documents show Mr Amersi purchased two properties in the UK - a Mayfair townhouse and country home in Gloucestershire using secretive offshore companies. Further investigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated Mr Amersi was involved in negotiations that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company. The firm was secretly owned through an offshore company by Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov. Telia had given her shares in one of its companies in 2007 and three years later agreed to buy most of the stock back for $220m - amove US authorities described in a criminal prosecution as a ""bribe payment...,externalin order to continue its telecoms business in Uzbekistan"". Telia was seeking new mobile operating licences for its business in the country at the time, and prosecutors say Ms Karimova - a one-time pop star and UN ambassador - had ""influence"" with the Uzbek regulator. The incident formed part of the case brought by the US Department of Justice against Telia and some of its officials. The proceedings were settled in 2017 without going to trial after Telia agreed to pay a penalty of more than $965m and accepted responsibility for breaking anti-corruption laws. Telia officials were charged in Sweden over their dealings with Ms Karimova - butthey were acquitted,externalafter a court ruled that the country's bribery laws did not apply in the case. Mr Amersi with his partner Nadezhda Rodicheva and the Duchess of Cornwall at a charity fashion show in 2018 British citizen born in Kenya to a family from an Iranian-Indian background Educated in the UK - studied medicine and law at Sheffield and Cambridge universities Described on the website of his charitable foundation as a ""renowned global communications entrepreneur, philanthropist and thought leader"" Spoken out against corruption in speeches Recently faced opposition from some Conservatives over his decision to set up a group to help run the party's relationships in the Middle East Internal Telia emails seen by the BBC connect Mr Amersi to the company's dealings with Ms Karimova's offshore firm Takilant. One message shows a Telia executive wrote to Mr Amersi, saying: ""I do not want to be involved on day to day negotiations so maybe you... can handle it"". Mr Amersi responded: ""Sure... I agree."" An invoice for his ""success fees"" for ""Project Uzbekistan"" - for $500,000 - is among the internal Telia documents. Panorama has also obtained evidence about how Mr Amersi was involved in other deals for Telia. Leaked details from an internal company report describe the activities of a consultant referred to as Mr XY who was paid more than $65m over six years. The payments included expenses for ""lavish corporate entertainment"" - usually between $100,000 and $200,000 a month - that were not  evidenced by receipts. The report states that some of the payments to Mr XY ""may have been utilised to improperly acquire regulatory benefits and/or secure the go-ahead of transactions"". It recommended that Telia's relationship with Mr XY be terminated. Former Telia executive Michaela Ahlberg, who was brought in to clean up the company, told Panorama that Mr Amersi was the consultant referred to in the report. ""It is important that people around him, that trust him, that listen to him, understand the whole context of his career, and wealth,"" she said. Ms Ahlberg said: ""He has been involved in one of the biggest corruption scandals that we have seen in Sweden in modern times. Panorama has confirmed that Mr Amersi was the ""adviser"" referred to at Telia's annual general meeting in 2014 as having had ""agreements"" with the company terminated after ""certain transactions in Eurasia"". In the AGM speech, Telia's then chief mentioned the ""inadequate governance"" of its Eurasian operations and operations ""not aligned with [Telia's] ethical requirements"", as well as ""questionable lobbying activitiesâ¦ on behalf"" of Telia. Telia has since exited central Asia and divested all of its business there to concentrate on its Scandinavian and northern European businesses and made changes to its corporate governance. It says it has now committed itself to transparency and openness. Mr Amersi's lawyers say it is ""entirely false"" to suggest his contract was terminated. They said he met senior political figures with Telia managers but ""only dealt with individuals... who were not considered politically exposed persons by mainstream institutions"". They said his fees and expenses were ""entirely in keeping with industry practice"" and Telia ""did not require regular sight of the receipts"". They added that: ""Any allegation that our client operated as a conduit to help Telia acquire regulatory benefits and secure telecoms deals... is categorically false."" The Conservative Party said ""fund raising is a legitimate part of the democratic process"" and that all donations to the party are properly and lawfully declared. It said the party performs compliance checks in line with legislation enacted by the last Labour government. The BBC searched for information about donors to all of the political parties among the Pandora Papers documents but the stories that emerged from the files were about Conservative donors. 9 December 2022: This article is the subject of a legal complaint by Mr Amersi who says its contents are false and defamatory of him The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

"The Pandora Papers leak has once again cast a spotlight on the funding of UK political parties by wealthy donors. The Conservative Party are under scrutiny after files included in the Pandora Papers leakrevealed how a prominent donor was involved in a corruption scandal. In the past, Labour and the Lib Dems have also been exposed for accepting money in questionable circumstances. Parties need to be able to raise money in order to run. But there are concerns when it looks like those giving cash expect something in return Running a political party costs money, particularly in the build-up to elections. Some Â£50m was spent by parties during the 2019 general election. Most income comes in the form of donations including those from individuals and companies. To give money as an individual you have to appear on a UK electoral register. Companies must be registered in the UK and carry out business in the country. Other sources of income for parties include membership fees, loans and a limited amount of public money. A vast majority of the Conservative Party's donations come from individuals: 68% during the 2019 election campaign. Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them? The Labour Party's income looks different. During the 2019 general election campaign, 93% of donations came from trade unions. National parties only have to record donations above Â£7,500, so the totals do not pick up the large base of Labour supporters who give small amounts. The largest union backer of Labour is Unite the Union. Last year it gave the party Â£1.6m in donations. This is on top of the fees that union members pay to ""affiliate"" with the Labour Party. At the start of his premiership, Tony Blair faced criticism over his interactions with Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston. New Labour had received Â£1m from Mr Eccleston months before coming to power in 1997, with another possible chunk on the way. It was later revealed that he had met Mr Blair to lobby him to exempt F1 from a tobacco advertising ban. A ""cash for honours"" scandal hit Tony Blair's government in 2006, when it emerged that a number of large secret loans had been made to the Labour Party before the 2005 general election. Some of the lenders had subsequently been nominated for the House of Lords. Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by the police during an investigation. However, the long and expensive probe led to no charges from the CPS. Offering seats in the House of Lords is still a controversial issue. In 2020Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominated Peter Cruddas- who had given Â£50,000 to Mr Johnson's campaign to be party leader - for a seat in the House of Lords, going against official advice. A businessman who was later convicted for perjury became the Liberal Democrats' largest donor in 2005, giving Â£2.4m to the party. The party faced criticism for not returning the donation,despite Michael Brown not being a registered UK voterand donating through a newly-created company. It's not always wealthy individuals. This summer the police launched aninvestigation into the SNP's financesafter the party had raised money in a crowdfunding drive. Donors had complained about how the money went on to be used. MPs can accept their own donations and gifts, as long as they declare them. The register of MPs' interests - which includes outside employment and free tickets to horse races - is updated every two weeks. Politicians are frequently found to have failed to declare interests in the correct way - usually resulting in an apology in Parliament. In 2018 DUP MPIan Paisley admitted ""deep personal embarrassment""after failing to declare two luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. Parties themselves must report donations and loans of more than Â£7,500 to the Electoral Commission - the organisation which regulates political donations in the UK. This register is updated every three months. Each party has a treasurer, who is legally responsible for checking whether a donor is legitimate. Guidance from the Electoral Commission says: ""As soon as you receive a donation, you must make sure you know who the donor is, and start checking their permissibility. You have 30 days to decide whether to accept or refuse the donation."" If a party breaks the rules about making declarations to the Electoral Commission a range of sanctions are available - including fines of up to Â£20,000. Very serious offensives can also be referred to the police. A parliamentaryreport published this year,externalrecommended steps to address the ""risk that the current rules on donations from companies provide a route for foreign money to influence UK elections"". The committee argued that donations should only be made ""from profits generated in the UK,"" and that new checks should be put in place ""for identifying the true source of a donation"". The report was welcomed by pressure groups including the Electoral Reform Society and Transparency International. In its 2019 election manifesto, the Conservative Party said it would ""protect the integrity of our democracy"". It has introduced new legislation, currently going through parliament, that includes measures to tighten the rules that prevent foreign money being used in campaigning.

"Scientists who discovered how our bodies feel the warmth of the sun or the hug of a loved one have won the Nobel Prize. David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian, from the US, share the 2021 prize in Medicine or Physiology for their work on sensing touch and temperature. They unpicked how our bodies convert physical sensations into electrical messages in the nervous system. Their findings could lead to new ways of treating pain. Heat, cold and touch are crucial for experiencing the world around us and for our own survival. But how our bodies actually do it had been one of the great mysteries of biology.

Thomas Perlman, from the Nobel Prize Committee, said: ""It was a very important and profound discovery."" Prof David Julius's breakthrough, at the University of California, San Francisco, came from investigating the burning pain we feel from eating a hot chilli pepper. He experimented with the source of a chilli's heat - the chemical capsaicin. He discovered the specific type of receptor (a part of our cells that detects the world around them) that responded to capsaicin. Further tests showed the receptor was responding to heat and kicked in at ""painful"" temperatures. This is what happens, for example, if you burn your hand on a cup of coffee. The discovery led to a flurry of other temperature-sensors being discovered. Prof Julius and Prof Ardem Patapoutian found one that could detect cold. Meanwhile, Prof Patapoutian, working at the Scripps Research institute, was also poking cells in a dish. Those experiments led to the discovery of a different type of receptor that was activated in response to mechanical force or touch. When you walk along a beach and feel the sand under your feet - it is these receptors that are sending signals to the brain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Patapoutian actually missed multiple attempts by the Nobel Prize committee to let him know he was a winner. His phone was set to do-not-disturb so the flurry of phone calls from Sweden (at 0200 California time) went unanswered. ""They somehow got to my 94 year old father who lives in Los Angeles and he was able to call me and wake me up and tell me the news, which was ended up being a fantastic way to find out,"" he said. These touch and temperature sensors have since been shown to have a wide role in the body and in some diseases. The first heat sensor (called TRPV1) is also involved in chronic pain and how our body regulates its core temperature. The touch receptor (PIEZ02) has multiple roles, from urinating to blood pressure. The Prize Committee said their work had ""allowed us to understand how heat, cold and mechanical force can initiate the nerve impulses that allow us to perceive and adapt to the world around us."" It added: ""This knowledge is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions, including chronic pain."" The pair will share the 10m Swedish kronor (Â£845,000) prize.

"This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick: ""My job now is to lead the Met through a difficult time"" An independent review is set to be carried out into the Met Police's standards and culture after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, said it would be led by a high profile person. The force has faced questions ever since Wayne Couzens, a serving police officer, killed the 33-year-old. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a ""massive job"" to do in restoring women's confidence in the police. Last week, Couzens, 48, was jailed for a full-life termfor the brutal attack. He abducted the marketing executive in March as she walked home from a friend's house under the guise of an arrest, before raping and killing her. He later burned her body. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Sarah Everard's murder sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women Dame Cressida said the review would specifically look into its internal culture and its professional standards such as systems, processes, leadership and training. She also called for a national review of police vetting standards. It comes asLabour raised concernsabout checks on parliamentary police in a letter to security officials. An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Couzens was known as ""the rapist"" by former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary because he made female colleagues feel so uncomfortable, and had been accused of indecent exposure in 2015, and in the days before the murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is now investigating ""offensive and abusive"" sexist messages shared by a WhatsApp group that involved Couzens. Met chief faces calls to quit over Everard case The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick Former Met Police detective Paige Kimberley won an employment tribunal against the force last month, after a job offer was withdrawn when she complained about ""vulgar and sexist"" WhatsApp group messages involving police officers. Ms Kimberley said the group, which did not involve Couzens, was set up to ""facilitate working practices"". Over time the comments became ""more sexualised, and more and more derogatory towards women"", she said. ""When I was approached to go back to work... I did bring up the WhatsApp group, I did say that it needed to be addressed,"" she said. ""And the next day I was told there was no position available for me."" Ms Kimberely, who reached the rank of deputy superintendent, said: ""What has really shocked me is that the extent to which the Met fought me, the way the Met have defended this. ""They clearly do think it's okay."" The review will look into the internal culture of the Met Police Baroness Nuala O'Loan, whoseinquiry into Daniel Morgan's murderconcluded that the Met was ""institutionally corrupt"", said the murder of Ms Everard raised similar issues. She said: ""We said that in their failure to be honest, for reputational reason, the conduct of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police, and of the institution, was corrupt. It was all about protecting the Met. ""Can you trust when you don't see actions to address the problems which you've pointed out to them?"" Dame Cressida said: ""I absolutely recognise the grave level of public concerns and the need to take urgent action. ""I hope the announcement today of an independent person to work with us helps demonstrate how seriously we take this and our commitment to making the changes needed."" When asked if she offered to resign, Dame Cressida said: ""People will be entitled to their opinion. I've got a job to do, I'm getting on with it. My job now is to lead the Met."" Earlier, the prime minister rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry from the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, who said there should be one into the vetting process used by the Met Police when recruiting officers. Dame Cressida Dick has rejected calls to resign after the murder of Sarah Everard Mr Johnson said the investigations by the Met and police watchdog should be allowed to proceed. He added although the government was investing in CCTV and street lighting, the culture of policing had to change and that more women should be recruited as police officers. ""I want to be clear, I believe people should be confident in the police,"" he said. ""I believe police officers, men and women up and down the country, will be absolutely sickened by what has happened, and they will be doing everything they can, and I know they do everything they can to help and reassure the public. So, it is vital that the public trust the police.""

"Daniel was attacked after a night out in Manchester in 2015 A victim of the UK's most prolific rapist Reynhard Sinaga has spoken of the sheer horror at discovering he had been attacked by the sexual predator. Sinaga was jailed for life last year after being convicted of drugging and raping 48 men in his Manchester flat. Police believe the post-graduate student had targeted more than 200 men. Daniel, the first victim to waive his right to anonymity, said he ""couldn't remember anything"" when he woke up in Sinaga's flat. It was only when Greater Manchester Police detectives showed him photographs of the attack two years later that he found out he had been raped. ""It is just horrible to see yourself that vulnerable in photographs that someone else has taken,"" he said. ""You can see I am comatose... I look dead."" Sinaga is serving a minimum of 40 years in jailafter being convicted of 159 sexual offences in January 2020. The 38-year-old, originally from Indonesia, ""stalked"" his victims who had became separated from friends on nights out before leading them to his Princess Street flat in Manchester city centre. GMP have released a custody photograph taken of Sinaga, showing injuries he received after his final victim awoke during the attack Speaking in BBC Two documentary Catching a Predator, Daniel said he decided to speak out to help other victims. ""To say as a man I have been raped is a hard thing,"" he said. ""It makes you feel so vulnerable."" Daniel had been on a night out in Manchester in 2015 celebrating his birthday with his partner and friends when they left to get a taxi home. ""I needed to go to the toilet so I went up an alleyway. I don't remember anything after that,"" he said. The following morning he woke up on a sofa fully dressed feeling ""groggy"" and said he ""could not remember anything"". ""Then I saw someone's feet walking round and I just froze,"" he said. ""And then they left the room and I just got up and ran out the door."" If you, or someone you know, have been affected by any issues raised in this story, support and information is available atBBC Action Line. Daniel said he never considered reporting it to police because he was ""doubting himself"", ""felt stupid"" and ""didn't have a clue what had happened"". It was only when a detective working on the Sinaga investigation - which was launched in June 2017 - came to see him that the truth of those missing hours emerged. ""I could see the way she looked at me [that] she recognised me,"" he said. Daniel said she showed him photographs of the attack, adding: ""There was no denying it was me. You could see my tattoo."" ""There is a bit of relief because you know what has happened finally and you can make sense of it but probably not the relief you want,"" he said. Det Con Dorothy Orr and Det Sgt Kimberley Hames-Evans worked on the Sinaga investigation Sinaga was caught when one victim regained consciousness during the assault and fought him off before reporting it to police. When officers seized Sinaga's phone they found he had filmed each of his attacks - amounting to hundreds of hours of footage - and launched the largest rape inquiry in British history. Det Sgt Kimberley Hames-Evans said the footage found on the phone was ""horrendous"". ""There were videos upon videos of young men being sexually abused and raped,"" she said. ""We get lots of reports of rape but seldom do you actually see one happen with your own eyes."" Police trace further 23 victims of serial rapist The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs Dad of UK's worst rapist: He got what he deserved Det Sgt Hames-Evans had to travel the ""length and breadth of the country, even overseas"" telling people what Sinaga had done to them. ""They just went very quiet and you [could] see the colour drain from their face. Just an 'oh my God' look on their face,"" she said. ""And I knew giving them that information that I've just ruined this person's life and you could see it."" Daniel said he decided to speak out to help other victims Det Con Dorothy Orr said the videos were ""shocking"" and ""horrific"", particularly because of the ""helplessness"" of the victims. ""When someone can take advantage of someone when they are physically ill and vomiting it is hideous,"" she said. Iain Simkin, lead prosecutor in the case against Sinaga, described him as ""savage"" and said in one of the videos he filmed himself raping two men in his flat for hours. He said it was ""worse than a Gothic horror story"". The Crown Prosecution Service barrister said he hoped the case had raised awareness of male rape, describing it as ""a graphic representation of the worst parts of human nature"". Daniel said he had been offered counselling ""but nothing has been as helpful as talking to my dad"". ""Men don't talk about male rape but his response was amazing,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" Insulate Britain protesters have been confronted by angry drivers as the group blocked more roads in London. Police arrested 38 climate change activists near the Blackwall Tunnel entrance during the morning rush hour. One driver confronted the demonstrators saying she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital. ""How can you be so selfish?"" she asked. Insulate Britain defended its tactics, saying disruptive direct action was effective and led to policy change. In a video captured by LBC,external, the driver said her mother was ""in the ambulance"", saying, ""She's going to the hospital in Canterbury. Do you think I'm stupid?"" ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass,"" she added. Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory were also targeted. It follows recent protests on the M25 and M4. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The Blackwall Tunnel is the latest river crossing to be targeted In other footage shared byTalk Radio,external, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. London Ambulance Service have also appealed to Insulate Britain to let their drivers pass. A spokesperson said: ""Ultimately, a delay to us reaching someone who needs our care can cost lives. We would ask any protesters to please allow our crews to pass to ensure we are able to reach people who need our help as quickly as possible."" Another driver held up was Dr Malik Saleh, a dentist who was stuck at the Hanger Lane gyratory. He said the protest had caused ""a crazy amount of inconvenience"" and that he had to cancel his appointments. ""The point is valid but there must be a better way around it,"" he said. A father, who wanted to be identified only as Will, said he was worried his 15-year-old autistic daughter, who has stress-related epilepsy, could have a seizure brought on by the fear of missing school, after she was stuck in the traffic for 45 minutes. He said the ""beeping and shouting"" did not help because of her sensory problems and she did not have her ear-defenders. ""If she does carry on stressing out at school today it will bring on a seizure. These protesters don't realise the consequences of their actions at all, and who it affects."" Ministers plan to enact tougher powers to tackle their direct action which has seen blockages to key arteries around London, including on the M25 and M4. Last month,the government won a High Court injunction, warning climate change protesters they could be jailed if they continued their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested since the group's demonstrations started last month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A reference by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ""Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days"" was met with boos at a fringe Maritime UK drinks reception at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday evening. Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes. Responding to criticism of the disruption caused to drivers, spokesman Craig Scudder said current government policies did not go far enough and disruptive action worked. He told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Mr Scudder said Insulate Britain had a policy of allowing blue light emergency vehicles to pass its roadblocks and the group provided video footage of activists moving to accommodate ambulances and medical cars. The government has said it is investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

"Cass Ezeji says felt ""lost"" at Gaelic school but has since gained an appreciation of her education Gaelic speakers of African and Caribbean descent have shared their experiences of the language in a new BBC Alba documentary. Glaswegian student and musician Cass Ezeji says some people she meets think it is unusual she is fluent in Gaelic and also has African heritage. Her paternal grandfather is Nigerian. Growing up, Cass went to the Glasgow Gaelic School, Sgoil GhÃ idhlig Ghlaschu, which teaches at both primary and secondary school levels. Cass' parents, who do not speak Gaelic, chose the school because they thought she would get a good education there. But Cass says she felt ""a little lost"" in immersive Gaelic-medium education, and among peers whose families were from the Highlands and Islands - the Western Isles are Gaelic's ""heartland"". She says she argued with her mum about having to go to the school, and even felt angry about it. The 27-year-old says: ""The impression I had when I left school was that I didn't feel part of the Gaelic world. ""I didn't see myself represented in the culture so there was something of a disconnect."" But she says she has since gained an appreciation of her education and describes herself as an Afro-Gael. Through making the documentary, which also examines racism and Scotland's historical links with the slave trade, Cass met other women of African and Caribbean descent who are also Gaelic speakers. Amina Davidson says she loves being part of Scotland's traditional music scene They include Amina Davidson, a traditional musician who lives in the Partick area of Glasgow. During the first lockdown last year, she joined her neighbour Robert Robertson - singer with the Scottish band Tide Lines - in singing the Gaelic song Teann a-Nall from the windows of their tenements to entertain other residents. A video of the performance on social media went viral. ""It now has 1.5 million views,"" says Amina. The singer says she enjoys being part of the traditional Scottish and Gaelic music scene, adding: ""It's a small, friendly world which I enjoy. ""Everyone knows one another and there are lots of traditional musicians in this area where I live."" Carrie Prescott says people sometimes find it unusual that she speaks Gaelic Carrie Prescott, of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, started learning Gaelic as an adult as part of a degree and is actively involved in the language and culture. She says: ""Sometimes when I'm at Gaelic events, or I'm speaking to somebody, and it transpires that I speak Gaelic they find it very unusual. ""They're not expecting us to be able to speak Gaelic."" Tawana Maramba, of Tranent, East Lothian, is a student and Gaelic singer. Her parents are from Zimbabwe and they raised her to speak their Shona language, but also encouraged her interest in other languages and placed her in a Gaelic-medium education primary school. Cass and Tawana Maramba, second right, and the Maramba family She says: ""In high school the only Gaelic-medium subject was Gaelic language, but in primary school every subject was in Gaelic. ""That was so good in primary school because it meant that we spoke Gaelic every day."" Tawana now teaches Gaelic singing and participates at the Royal National Mod, an annual celebration of the language and culture. Last year, she appeared in a Gaelic short film about Eliza Junor,a girl from Guyana and the descendant of slaves who grew up in Fortrose in the Highlands in the early 19th Century. Tawana says: ""I feel some people react like: 'Oh you speak Gaelic?' ""But I'm quite proud of that. It plays a huge part in my life."" The documentary, Trusadh: Afro-GÃ idheil - Afro-Gaels, will be shown on BBC Alba on Monday at 21:00 and will later be available on iPlayer.

"About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel. One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a ""marked improvement"" across the rest of the UK thanks to ""steady deliveries"". But conditions in the South East are ""still challenging"", the PRA said. The improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its Â£30 cap on buying fuel at its sites. It said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England. However, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease ""in the coming days"" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies. About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts. The PRA said the situation around London and the South East was ""still challenging"". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry. In the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel ""thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand"", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry. ""We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. The PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts. Is the petrol shortage improving? The government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts. More than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers. The drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work. Hoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. A government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was ""continuing to stabilise"". ""More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,"" the spokesperson said. 23 September:BP temporarily closes some petrol stationsdue to a shortage of lorry drivers 25 September:After days of long queues at stations, with many running dry, the governmentannounces a temporary visa scheme, allowing 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas 27 September:The Army is put on standbyto help deliver fuel to stations hit by shortages 28 September:Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays the situation at forecourts is ""stabilising"", while the PRA says there are ""early signs"" pressure is starting to ease at pumps 2 October:Despite a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide,the PRA says petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England 4 October: Army starts to deliver fuel to speed up replenishments The crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. Many sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes. David Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies. ""This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,"" he said. ""We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. Most fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK. Airlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper. But those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Under the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. Testing rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. Anyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing. These groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. How are the green and amber lists changing on Monday? Plan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? All travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. And those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. The red list is due to be updated later this week. The government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector. ""Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery."" There was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month andthe travel sector has welcomed the move. The industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. From later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. No date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. So far, no other UK nation has followed suit. Scotland has said it will ""align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had ""concerns"" about easing its testing regime. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: ""Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel."" However, he said the UK remained ""an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers"". Airlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. Willie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a ""positive step"", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. ""People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,"" he said. Alan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. ""They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,"" he said. Mr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double. The UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. However, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.

"This video can not be played Frances Haugen: ""If Facebook change the algorithm to be safer... they'll make less money"" A former Facebook whistleblower responsible for a series of bombshell leaks has revealed her identity. Frances Haugen, 37, who worked as a product manager on the civic integrity team at Facebook, was interviewed on Sunday by CBS. She said the documents she leaked proved that Facebook repeatedly prioritised ""growth over safety"". Facebook said the leaks were misleading and glossed over positive research conducted by the company. In the interview, on CBS's 60 Minutes programme, Ms Haugen said she had left Facebook earlier this year after becoming exasperated with the company. Before departing, she copied a series of internal memos and documents. She shared those documents with the Wall Street Journal, which has been releasing the material in batches over the last three weeks - sometimes referred to as the Facebook Files. Revelations included documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated differently by the company. The leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied differently, or not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck (cross-check). Another leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders. The group alleges, among other things, that Facebook's $5bn (Â£3.65bn) payment to the US Federal Trade Commission to resolve the Cambridge Analytica data scandal was so high because it was designed to protect Mark Zuckerberg from personal liability. But it's allegations about Instagram that have been particularly worrying to US politicians. Facebook Files: 5 things leaked documents reveal Facebook under fire over secret teen research Instagram for kids paused after backlash Internal research by Facebook (which owns Instagram) found that Instagram was impacting the mental health of teenagers but did not share its findings when they suggested that the platform was a ""toxic"" place for many youngsters. According to slides reported by the Wall Street Journal, 32% of teenage girls surveyed said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse. Ms Haugen will testify before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online"", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users. Last week, a Facebook executive testified to US senators that the leaks had failed to highlight the positive impact the platform had on teens. However, Ms Haugen was damning in her assessment of her former employer. ""There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,"" she said. ""Facebook over and over again chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money."" Facebook strongly denied that claim, saying it had spent significant sums of money on safety.""To say we turn a blind eye to feedback ignores these investments, including the 40,000 people working on safety and security at Facebook and our investment of $13 billion (Â£9.6 billion) since 2016,"" said Lena Pietsch, Facebook's director of policy communications. Ms Haugen also talked about the deadly Capitol Hill riots in January - claiming that Facebook helped fuel the violence. She said Facebook turned on safety systems to reduce misinformation during the US election - but only temporarily. ""As soon as the election was over they turned them back off, or they changed the settings to what they were before, to prioritise growth over safety, and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy."" Appearing on CNN, Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said it was ludicrous to suggest Facebook was responsible for the riots. ""I think it gives people false comfort to assume that there must be a technological, or technical, explanation for the issues of political polarisation in the United States,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick: ""My job now is to lead the Met through a difficult time"" An independent review is set to be carried out into the Met Police's standards and culture after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, said it would be led by a high profile person. The force has faced questions ever since Wayne Couzens, a serving police officer, killed the 33-year-old. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a ""massive job"" to do in restoring women's confidence in the police. Last week, Couzens, 48, was jailed for a full-life termfor the brutal attack. He abducted the marketing executive in March as she walked home from a friend's house under the guise of an arrest, before raping and killing her. He later burned her body. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Sarah Everard's murder sparked calls for more action to tackle violence against women Dame Cressida said the review would specifically look into its internal culture and its professional standards such as systems, processes, leadership and training. She also called for a national review of police vetting standards. It comes asLabour raised concernsabout checks on parliamentary police in a letter to security officials. An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Couzens was known as ""the rapist"" by former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary because he made female colleagues feel so uncomfortable, and had been accused of indecent exposure in 2015, and in the days before the murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is now investigating ""offensive and abusive"" sexist messages shared by a WhatsApp group that involved Couzens. Met chief faces calls to quit over Everard case The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick Former Met Police detective Paige Kimberley won an employment tribunal against the force last month, after a job offer was withdrawn when she complained about ""vulgar and sexist"" WhatsApp group messages involving police officers. Ms Kimberley said the group, which did not involve Couzens, was set up to ""facilitate working practices"". Over time the comments became ""more sexualised, and more and more derogatory towards women"", she said. ""When I was approached to go back to work... I did bring up the WhatsApp group, I did say that it needed to be addressed,"" she said. ""And the next day I was told there was no position available for me."" Ms Kimberely, who reached the rank of deputy superintendent, said: ""What has really shocked me is that the extent to which the Met fought me, the way the Met have defended this. ""They clearly do think it's okay."" The review will look into the internal culture of the Met Police Baroness Nuala O'Loan, whoseinquiry into Daniel Morgan's murderconcluded that the Met was ""institutionally corrupt"", said the murder of Ms Everard raised similar issues. She said: ""We said that in their failure to be honest, for reputational reason, the conduct of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police, and of the institution, was corrupt. It was all about protecting the Met. ""Can you trust when you don't see actions to address the problems which you've pointed out to them?"" Dame Cressida said: ""I absolutely recognise the grave level of public concerns and the need to take urgent action. ""I hope the announcement today of an independent person to work with us helps demonstrate how seriously we take this and our commitment to making the changes needed."" When asked if she offered to resign, Dame Cressida said: ""People will be entitled to their opinion. I've got a job to do, I'm getting on with it. My job now is to lead the Met."" Earlier, the prime minister rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry from the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, who said there should be one into the vetting process used by the Met Police when recruiting officers. Dame Cressida Dick has rejected calls to resign after the murder of Sarah Everard Mr Johnson said the investigations by the Met and police watchdog should be allowed to proceed. He added although the government was investing in CCTV and street lighting, the culture of policing had to change and that more women should be recruited as police officers. ""I want to be clear, I believe people should be confident in the police,"" he said. ""I believe police officers, men and women up and down the country, will be absolutely sickened by what has happened, and they will be doing everything they can, and I know they do everything they can to help and reassure the public. So, it is vital that the public trust the police.""

"Craig has starred in five Bond films Daniel Craig's final film as James Bond has notched up the highest opening weekend UK takings of any 007 movie. Craig's fifth outing as 007 made Â£25.9m between Friday and Sunday, according to box office trackers Comscore. It beat Skyfall's first weekend takings of Â£20.2m and Spectre's Â£19.8m. Those films sit at numbers two and three in the all-time UK box office chart. Many in the industry are hoping No Time to Die will kickstart the box office after cinemas shut during the pandemic. It was directed by US film-maker Cary Joji Fukunaga and also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. Most critics praised the film, with many giving five-star reviews after its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this week. But some suggested the movie did not quite justify its 163-minute running time. Universal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019. When Skyfall made its big screen debut nine years ago, it opened in 587 cinemas. Focus will soon switch to how No Time to Die performs on the other side of the Atlantic when the film opens there on 8 October. Other major countries yet to experience 007's latest adventures include France, Russia, China and Australia, with release global dates scheduled for later this month and November. The box office market in the US and Canada currently appears to be in rude health, with Venom: Let There Be Carnage taking $90.1m (Â£66.3m) on its debut this weekend, setting a new pandemic-era record. The supervillain sequel starring Tom Hardy also beat the original film's first weekend haul of $80.1m in 2018.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful. More than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week. The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. The Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets. Stories revealed so far include: the owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms, including individuals accused of corruption the Qatari ruling family whoavoided Â£18.5m tax on a London super-mansion Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spreeafter off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse the prominent Tory donor who wasinvolved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals the King of Jordan's Â£70m spending spreeon properties in the UK and US through secretly-owned companies Azerbaijan's leading family'shidden involvement in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m the Czech prime minister'sfailure to declare an offshore investment companyused to purchase two French villas for Â£12m how the family of Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta'ssecretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades The files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth. Lakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people ""are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,"" often through the use of anonymous companies. The Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets. For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or ""offshore"". These offshore countries orterritoriesare where: it's easy to set up companies there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies there is low or no corporation tax The destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance ""involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law"". There are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments. Although having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality. There have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such asthe Panama Papers. But Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that ""the people that could end the secrecy offshoreâ¦ are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it"". All you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office. It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business. It is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year. Ms Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: ""The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home."" The UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. The government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs. A 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people ""such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds"". It said criminal investigations are often ""hindered"" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties. The government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from ""medium"" to ""high"". It says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

"The chairman of supermarket chain Morrisons has insisted the supermarket will be able to deliver a ""good"" Christmas for customers despite supply chain issues. Andy Higginson said he was ""not worried"" about logistical issues with supermarkets supplying products. He said the issues were ""well publicised"" and ""slightly overblown"". His comments come just two days after US private equity firm CD&R won an auction to buy Morrisons. The Â£7bn ($9.5bn) bid for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) just trumped an offer from rival suitor Fortress. The takeover will mark a return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R. There has been speculation that Mr Leahy will become the new chairman of Morrisons, as Mr Higginson will stand down from his post once the deal with CD&R is completed. Morrisons warns driver shortage will raise prices Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers Morrisons to stop selling plastic carrier bags Morrisons owns a quarter of its suppliers, including fisheries and meat production operations, and Mr Higginson said that was one of the reasons the private equity firm had found the business attractive. ""Private equity gets a bit of a bad rap sometimes,"" Mr Higginson said. He added that private equity is ""focused on growth and trying to grow businesses - it's the way they make returns... and that's very much the case here"". The supermarket chain has arrangements with 2,700 British farmers, who deliver livestock and produce directly to its 17 food processing facilities, which supply 493 stores. ""Supply chains in the UK are incredibly efficient and I'm sure we'll be able to deliver a great Christmas for customers as we go through,"" Mr Higginson added. ""I think it'll be a good Christmas for people, I think they'll want to treat themselves"". Rewind to the start of the summer, and the supermarket chain Morrisons is a stock market plodder, a company to be invested in for its healthy dividend rather than any hope of a big rise in the share price. It's a British supermarket, and we all know that the UK grocery market is fiercely competitive with big players that are well-entrenched and little hope of rapid growth. That was the orthodoxy, and the events of the past four months have made it look a little silly. Then, Morrisons shares hovered around 180p. On Saturday, a private-equity-led consortium won an auction to buy the company at 287p a share. Those fund managers who dismissed Morrison's prospects and chose not to own the shares have missed out on a pound-a-share payday. What did the City miss? According to Andy Higginson, Morrison's outgoing chairman - like the company's other non-executive directors, he will leave when the deal is completed - the Square Mile's fund managers could not see the ""inherent strength"" of the chain, which owns many of its store freeholds, has its own food production assets, and a pension scheme in surplus. Mr Higginson said Morrisons was not alone in having been undervalued, describing it as a ""sector problem"". That idea that supermarkets in general are neglected by the City raises the intriguing prospect that other chains may find themselves being wooed by private investor groups. Last month, the supermarket warned that it expected the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices. However, it also said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability. Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. The business was founded by William Morrison, and his son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the Conservative conference in Manchester Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said there is no ""magic wand"" to make disruption to fuel and food supplies disappear overnight. He told the BBC supply problems were global, and ministers were doing everything they can to mitigate them. ""Pragmatic controlled immigration"" could be part of the short-term solution, he said. He was speaking ahead of addressing the Conservative party conference amid concerns over living standards. The Chancellor's first in-person speech to Tory members comes against a backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongsidecuts to universal creditbenefits and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care. Supply chain issues are continuing to affect several sectors, with the military due to begin driving fuel to petrol stations. PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit What impact has the furlough scheme had? Most roles not filled in plan to help young jobless Kuenssberg: Is the Tory party at ease with itself on tax? Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said ""challenges"" to supply chains are not unique to the UK but were a problem across the world as a result of lockdowns and the rapid re-opening of economies. But he said the government was doing ""everything we can to mitigate the bits of that that we can"". ""There are things that we can do and should do and it is reasonable that people expect us to do what we can,"" he said. ""Whether it's short-term visas, speeding up testing capacity for HGV drivers, of course we should do all those things and we are doing all those things, but we can't wave a magic wand and make global supply chain challenges disappear overnight."" But he said the problems ""we are seeing at the moment will be transitory and will pass through the system"". PM Boris Johnson also insisted supply problems were part of an international trend, telling reporters they were due to the global economy ""coming back to life"" after Covid shutdowns. ""There's a shortage of lorry drivers actually around the world,"" he added. The prime minister tried on Sunday to present this as short-term pain as part of what he believes will be very significant long-term gains because of Brexit. Now, the prime minister and other ministers would not say, 'oh, suck it up, enjoy the fact that you have to queue for petrol'. But they have, in the last few days, woven this narrative: to take some of the things that we see happening, acutely, whether in agriculture, whether in fuel supply - and to turn them into this story of short-term pain for a long-term gain. That was not Rishi Sunak's language. He talked rather soberly about global supply shortages, things that the government can mitigate, clearly he believes the government does have a role. But he was very different in tone, which was something on the day of a big chancellor's speech at this conference, very well worth noting. In his speech later, Mr Sunak will say the best protection against cost of living challenges is to give people the skills and opportunities to get better paid work. The chancellor will commit Â£500m to renew job support programmes and  promise to ""double down"" on help for the jobs market after Covid. He will also promise to reshape the economy around technology and scientific innovation. Ahead of his speech, Mr Sunak praised the UK's economic recovery but warned the ""job is not done yet"". ""At the start of this crisis I made a promise to do whatever it takes, and I'm ready to double down on that promise now as we come out of this crisis,"" he said. He will also promise to make the UK the ""the most exciting place on the planet"" through better infrastructure and improved skills. Activists queued earlier for a space to watch Rishi Sunak's speech, the biggest of the conference so far His speech will come on the second day of conference, and he will say the Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022. The scheme, launched in September last year, was allocated Â£2bn in funding to create 250,000 jobs by the end of 2021. However, only 76,900 have actually started Kickstart roles, accordingto latest figures,external, with 196,300 roles in total made available for youngsters to apply for. The Federation of Small Businesses had been calling for the scheme to be extended, amid reports that firms had encountered delays and found the scheme slow. Mr Sunak will also announce the extension of the JETS scheme to help long-term unemployed people on universal credit until September 2022. A separate scheme paying employers Â£3,000 per apprentice they take on will also be prolonged by four months until the end of January. And the government is promising more help finding work for those coming off the furlough scheme, whichclosed last week, having paid the wages of 11.6 million workers during the pandemic. The various extensions will be paid for with Â£500m of funding, with the Treasury saying that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review on 27 October. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government's plan to support jobs was ""struggling"" and had ""failed to hit its original targets"". ""An extended deadline will do nothing to compensate for the chancellor's tax rises, cost of living crisis and cuts to universal credit,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""Our recovery comes with a cost"" Rishi Sunak has told Conservative party members that future tax cuts are conditional on repairing the UK's public finances after Covid. In his first conference speech as chancellor, he said he wanted lower taxes - but funding the pandemic recovery ""comes with a cost"". Vowing that ""we need to fix our public finances"", he said allowing borrowing to rise further would be ""immoral"". The comments come three weeks before his autumn Budget on 27 October. He also told party delegates that leaving the EU was in the UK's long-term interests, despite current disruption to fuel and food supplies. And he added he was ""proud"" to have backed Brexit, in spite of warnings before the 2016 referendum it could end his political career. PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit Sunak: No magic wand to solve supply problems Mr Sunak's speech comes amid a difficult backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside supply chain disruption caused by a shortage of lorry drivers. The government has so far rejected demands from the haulage industry for it to increase the 5,000 temporary visas it plans for foreign drivers to plug shortfalls. In his speech, Mr Sunak insisted that despite ""challenges"", Brexit would foster a ""culture of enterprise"" and help the UK adapt to the modern world. He also defendedraising taxesto pay for the NHS and social care, insisting that it would be ""irresponsible"" to pay for investment with higher borrowing instead. He told delegates the country should be grateful for ""sound Conservative management"" of the economy by his predecessors since 2010. And whilst he acknowledged tax rises were unpopular and perceived as ""un-Conservative"", he said they were a better option than more debt. ""I'll tell you what is un-Conservative: Unfunded pledges, reckless borrowing, and soaring debt,"" he added. ""Yes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that, our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing."" There was no whizz-bangery in the chancellor's speech - no cranking of the huge economic levers on tax or spending, no huge headline grabbing policy. And, a little like Rishi Sunak himself, it was quite short. (He made a little joke about his stature himself...) This felt like the first draft of Sunak-ism: where the chancellor has come from, what he's all about, where he might go in the future, to an audience where many will wonder if he might one day be prime minister. There were repeated references to his time in California, that spot so often associated with sunshine and innovation. After the public spending splurges of the pandemic, he portrayed himself as a traditional Conservative: cautious in how taxpayers' money is spent, drawn to cut taxes when he can - even though he's put them up. This hoodie-wearing chancellor - although he did wear a suit for his speech - made 16 references to the ""future,"" including the line ""the future is here."" Whom could he have been referring to? Against the backdrop of the withdrawal of aÂ£20-a-week universal credit top-up, Mr Sunak also attacked Labour - which opposes the cut - for wanting struggling families to ""lean ever more on the state"". ""Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?,"" he asked, adding: ""Be in no doubt, that is the essence of the Labour answer"". ""Not only does Labour's approach not work in practice, it is a desperately sad vision for our future."" ""But there is an alternative. An approach focused on good work, better skills, and higher wages."" Mr Sunak also announced the government would give funding to double the number of Turing research fellows investigating the potential of artificial intelligence. He also committed Â£500m to renew job support programmes set up during the Covid pandemic, after the end of the furlough scheme last month. The Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022. And the JETS scheme, which helps long-term unemployed people on universal credit, will be prolonged until September 2022. The Treasury said that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review, which will take place alongside the Budget later this month.

"About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel. One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a ""marked improvement"" across the rest of the UK thanks to ""steady deliveries"". But conditions in the South East are ""still challenging"", the PRA said. The improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its Â£30 cap on buying fuel at its sites. It said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England. However, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease ""in the coming days"" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies. About 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts. The PRA said the situation around London and the South East was ""still challenging"". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry. In the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel ""thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand"", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry. ""We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. The PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts. Is the petrol shortage improving? The government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts. More than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers. The drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work. Hoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. A government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was ""continuing to stabilise"". ""More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,"" the spokesperson said. 23 September:BP temporarily closes some petrol stationsdue to a shortage of lorry drivers 25 September:After days of long queues at stations, with many running dry, the governmentannounces a temporary visa scheme, allowing 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK in the run-up to Christmas 27 September:The Army is put on standbyto help deliver fuel to stations hit by shortages 28 September:Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsays the situation at forecourts is ""stabilising"", while the PRA says there are ""early signs"" pressure is starting to ease at pumps 2 October:Despite a ""distinct improvement"" nationwide,the PRA says petrol supplies remain critical in London and south-east England 4 October: Army starts to deliver fuel to speed up replenishments The crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. Many sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes. David Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies. ""This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,"" he said. ""We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"The chairman of supermarket chain Morrisons has insisted the supermarket will be able to deliver a ""good"" Christmas for customers despite supply chain issues. Andy Higginson said he was ""not worried"" about logistical issues with supermarkets supplying products. He said the issues were ""well publicised"" and ""slightly overblown"". His comments come just two days after US private equity firm CD&R won an auction to buy Morrisons. The Â£7bn ($9.5bn) bid for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) just trumped an offer from rival suitor Fortress. The takeover will mark a return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R. There has been speculation that Mr Leahy will become the new chairman of Morrisons, as Mr Higginson will stand down from his post once the deal with CD&R is completed. Morrisons warns driver shortage will raise prices Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers Morrisons to stop selling plastic carrier bags Morrisons owns a quarter of its suppliers, including fisheries and meat production operations, and Mr Higginson said that was one of the reasons the private equity firm had found the business attractive. ""Private equity gets a bit of a bad rap sometimes,"" Mr Higginson said. He added that private equity is ""focused on growth and trying to grow businesses - it's the way they make returns... and that's very much the case here"". The supermarket chain has arrangements with 2,700 British farmers, who deliver livestock and produce directly to its 17 food processing facilities, which supply 493 stores. ""Supply chains in the UK are incredibly efficient and I'm sure we'll be able to deliver a great Christmas for customers as we go through,"" Mr Higginson added. ""I think it'll be a good Christmas for people, I think they'll want to treat themselves"". Rewind to the start of the summer, and the supermarket chain Morrisons is a stock market plodder, a company to be invested in for its healthy dividend rather than any hope of a big rise in the share price. It's a British supermarket, and we all know that the UK grocery market is fiercely competitive with big players that are well-entrenched and little hope of rapid growth. That was the orthodoxy, and the events of the past four months have made it look a little silly. Then, Morrisons shares hovered around 180p. On Saturday, a private-equity-led consortium won an auction to buy the company at 287p a share. Those fund managers who dismissed Morrison's prospects and chose not to own the shares have missed out on a pound-a-share payday. What did the City miss? According to Andy Higginson, Morrison's outgoing chairman - like the company's other non-executive directors, he will leave when the deal is completed - the Square Mile's fund managers could not see the ""inherent strength"" of the chain, which owns many of its store freeholds, has its own food production assets, and a pension scheme in surplus. Mr Higginson said Morrisons was not alone in having been undervalued, describing it as a ""sector problem"". That idea that supermarkets in general are neglected by the City raises the intriguing prospect that other chains may find themselves being wooed by private investor groups. Last month, the supermarket warned that it expected the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices. However, it also said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability. Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. The business was founded by William Morrison, and his son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years.

"Daniel was attacked after a night out in Manchester in 2015 A victim of the UK's most prolific rapist Reynhard Sinaga has spoken of the sheer horror at discovering he had been attacked by the sexual predator. Sinaga was jailed for life last year after being convicted of drugging and raping 48 men in his Manchester flat. Police believe the post-graduate student had targeted more than 200 men. Daniel, the first victim to waive his right to anonymity, said he ""couldn't remember anything"" when he woke up in Sinaga's flat. It was only when Greater Manchester Police detectives showed him photographs of the attack two years later that he found out he had been raped. ""It is just horrible to see yourself that vulnerable in photographs that someone else has taken,"" he said. ""You can see I am comatose... I look dead."" Sinaga is serving a minimum of 40 years in jailafter being convicted of 159 sexual offences in January 2020. The 38-year-old, originally from Indonesia, ""stalked"" his victims who had became separated from friends on nights out before leading them to his Princess Street flat in Manchester city centre. GMP have released a custody photograph taken of Sinaga, showing injuries he received after his final victim awoke during the attack Speaking in BBC Two documentary Catching a Predator, Daniel said he decided to speak out to help other victims. ""To say as a man I have been raped is a hard thing,"" he said. ""It makes you feel so vulnerable."" Daniel had been on a night out in Manchester in 2015 celebrating his birthday with his partner and friends when they left to get a taxi home. ""I needed to go to the toilet so I went up an alleyway. I don't remember anything after that,"" he said. The following morning he woke up on a sofa fully dressed feeling ""groggy"" and said he ""could not remember anything"". ""Then I saw someone's feet walking round and I just froze,"" he said. ""And then they left the room and I just got up and ran out the door."" If you, or someone you know, have been affected by any issues raised in this story, support and information is available atBBC Action Line. Daniel said he never considered reporting it to police because he was ""doubting himself"", ""felt stupid"" and ""didn't have a clue what had happened"". It was only when a detective working on the Sinaga investigation - which was launched in June 2017 - came to see him that the truth of those missing hours emerged. ""I could see the way she looked at me [that] she recognised me,"" he said. Daniel said she showed him photographs of the attack, adding: ""There was no denying it was me. You could see my tattoo."" ""There is a bit of relief because you know what has happened finally and you can make sense of it but probably not the relief you want,"" he said. Det Con Dorothy Orr and Det Sgt Kimberley Hames-Evans worked on the Sinaga investigation Sinaga was caught when one victim regained consciousness during the assault and fought him off before reporting it to police. When officers seized Sinaga's phone they found he had filmed each of his attacks - amounting to hundreds of hours of footage - and launched the largest rape inquiry in British history. Det Sgt Kimberley Hames-Evans said the footage found on the phone was ""horrendous"". ""There were videos upon videos of young men being sexually abused and raped,"" she said. ""We get lots of reports of rape but seldom do you actually see one happen with your own eyes."" Police trace further 23 victims of serial rapist The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs Dad of UK's worst rapist: He got what he deserved Det Sgt Hames-Evans had to travel the ""length and breadth of the country, even overseas"" telling people what Sinaga had done to them. ""They just went very quiet and you [could] see the colour drain from their face. Just an 'oh my God' look on their face,"" she said. ""And I knew giving them that information that I've just ruined this person's life and you could see it."" Daniel said he decided to speak out to help other victims Det Con Dorothy Orr said the videos were ""shocking"" and ""horrific"", particularly because of the ""helplessness"" of the victims. ""When someone can take advantage of someone when they are physically ill and vomiting it is hideous,"" she said. Iain Simkin, lead prosecutor in the case against Sinaga, described him as ""savage"" and said in one of the videos he filmed himself raping two men in his flat for hours. He said it was ""worse than a Gothic horror story"". The Crown Prosecution Service barrister said he hoped the case had raised awareness of male rape, describing it as ""a graphic representation of the worst parts of human nature"". Daniel said he had been offered counselling ""but nothing has been as helpful as talking to my dad"". ""Men don't talk about male rape but his response was amazing,"" he said.

"Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been suspended as investors await a statement about its future. The crisis at the world's most indebted property developer has triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets. The firm said the trade halt came ahead of ""an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction"". It comes amid reports that a rival real estate firm is reportedly set to buy a majority stake in an Evergrande unit. In a regulatory statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,external, Evergrande Group said that its shares had been suspended from trading ""pending the release by the Company of an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction."" What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail? Meanwhile, rival Hong Kong-listed property firm Hopson Development is set to buy a 51% stake in Evergrande Real Estate for around $5bn, according to Chinese news outlet Cailian Press. Hopson has not yet commented on the report but has suspended trading in its shares, pending an announcement""in relation to a major transaction"",external. Evergrande's problems have rocked markets over concerns about its more than $300bn (Â£222bn) of debt. The firm's shares have fallen by almost 80% since the start of this year. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng share index ended Monday's trading session 2.2% lower. In recent weeks Evergrande has struggled to make payments to investors in its bonds and wealth management products. Last Thursday, the cash-strapped group said that its wealth management business had made a 10% repayment on its products , which are mainly owned by Chinese retail investors,. That contrasts with reports of overseas bondholders saying the company had failed to make interest payments by the date they were due. The hugely indebted property giant reportedly missed interest payments to overseas investors last week for the second time in a matter of days. It was due to pay foreign bond holders $47.5m by Wednesday. But bondholders told Reuters news agency and Bloomberg that they were yet to receive any payment. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before the missed payments officially become a default. Evergrande has interest debt payments of more than $160m due in the next month. The company has been taking steps in recent weeks to raise money owed to customers, investors and suppliers. Last week, it said it was selling a $1.5bn stake it owned in a commercial bank. The almost 20% stake in Shengjing Bank was bought by a state-owned asset management company. Under the agreement, the proceeds of the sale are to be used to pay money Evergrande owes to Shengjing Bank, which is one of the main lenders to the heavily-indebted firm. The company's total liabilities are equal to around 2% of China's gross domestic product. That has triggered concerns that its problems could spread through the world's second largest economy and send shockwaves around the global financial system.

And if you want to catch up on what we know about the leaks so farcheck out our simple guide. Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. It's been a busy day but there's more to come on tonight's episode of BBC Panorama. The Pandora Papers: Political Donors Exposedison BBC One at 19:35 BSTor you can watch back lateron BBC iPlayer(UK only). The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister. Lubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving nearly Â£1.9m since 2012. The Pandora Papers reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money. Her donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. Mrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister. Read our full investigation here. Tony Blair's New Labour received Â£1m from Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston months before coming to power At the start of his premiership, Tony Blair faced criticism over his interactions with Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston. New Labour had received Â£1m from Mr Eccleston months before coming to power in 1997, with another possible chunk on the way. It was later revealed that he had met Mr Blair to lobby him to exempt F1 from a tobacco advertising ban. A ""cash for honours"" scandal hit Tony Blair's government in 2006, when it emerged that a number of large secret loans had been made to the Labour Party before the 2005 general election. Some of the lenders had subsequently been nominated for the House of Lords. Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by the police during an investigation. However, the long and expensive probe led to no charges from the CPS. Offering seats in the House of Lords is still a controversial issue. In 2020Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominated Peter Cruddas- who had given Â£50,000 to Mr Johnson's campaign to be party leader - for a seat in the House of Lords, going against official advice. A businessman who was later convicted for perjury became the Liberal Democrats' largest donor in 2005, giving Â£2.4m to the party. The party faced criticism for not returning the donation,despite Michael Brown not being a registered UK voterand donating through a newly-created company. It's not always wealthy individuals. This summer the police launched aninvestigation into the SNP's financesafter the party had raised money in a crowdfunding drive. Donors had complained about how the money went on to be used. Read morehere. Who got hold of the leaked files? The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) - a nonprofit newsroom and network of journalists based in Washington DC. They led the two-year investigation, codenamed ""Aladdin"". How did the investigation work? More than 140 media organisations and 600 journalists across the world collaborated on the investigation, including the BBC, Le Monde and the Washington Post. They sifted through more than 11.9 million files, following leads across the world. Who led the investigation in the UK? BBC Panorama and the Guardian. Both outlets also led on the previous similar leaks such as the Panama and Paradise Papers. Will the data be made public? The ICIJ is planning on publishing some of the data in November, with the rest to be made public early next year. How does it compare to previous leaks? In recent years, the financial dealings of some of the world's wealthiest and most people have been revealed in leaks such as the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers. The Panama Papers leak in 2016 comprised of 11.5 million files of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, with 2.6 terabytes of data. The Paradise Papers in 2017 contained 13.4 million documents in 1.4 terabytes of data from British Virgin Islands law firm Appleby. The Pandora Papers has files from 14 different offshore service providers, rather than just one firm. Margaret Hodge has campaigned against corruption Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption and Responsible Tax, says ""dirty money has infected our politics"". Sharing an article about businessman Victor Fedotov,she writes on Twitter,external: ""Access and influence is cheap. Our democracy is under threat."" Mr Fedotov - a former oil executive - owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. His businesses have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to 34 Tory MPs and their local parties. Pandora Paper files show he made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read more about the storyhere. We reported earlier that leaked files show a businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal. Economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister John Glen was asked about the allegations against former oil executive Victor Fedotov when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme earlier. Mr Glen told the programme he was not familiar with the details of the allegations but ""as I
understand it, that individual has complied with the law in this country"". However, he added: ""Iâm happy to look at it, as any responsible minister in my position with my
responsibilities would."" Mr Fedotov's lawyers say ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he has behaved improperly. You can read more about Mr Fedotov and his links to the Conservatives here. This video can not be played Max
Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, says he hopes the Pandora Papers will spark discussions about greater taxation of the rich. ""Yet again it shows us that thereâs one rule for the rich and
then one rule for ordinary people,"" he tells BBC World News. ""Think of the cost of all of the state interventions for Covid-19,
the impact on the poorest people - we need that money. ""We canât have it tied up
in dusty vaults in the Bahamas, in these secret spaces. We need to liberate
that cash, spend it on schools, spend it on hospitals.â ""We really hope that [leaks] like this continue to push the world
to actually act and stop rich people avoiding tax on this industrial scale,"" he adds. Reality Check A
row has broken out in Pakistan after state television (PTV) wrongly claimed that Junaid Safdar, a grandson of former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, is among 700 Pakistanis named in the Pandora Papers
investigation. Mr
Sharifâs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N), leads the opposition to the
current government. Mr
Sharif himself resigned as prime minister in 2017 in the fallout from a
previous document leak, known as the Panama Papers. State
TV alleged that Mr Safdar had five companies registered in his name, a claim
also tweeted out by an assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan and by another
member of the government. A Twitter account also appeared on Sunday called
âPandoraLeaksâ, containing the claims about Mr Safdar - but itâs nothing to do
with the real Pandora papers. The team of journalists working on the Pandora Papers investigation in Pakistan confirmed to the BBC that Junaid Safdar had not been named in the documents. However, Ali Dar, the son-in-law of Nawaz Sharif, does feature in the list of names contained in the papers. Mr Dar has denied doing anything illegal, and says he is not a resident in Pakistan for tax purposes. The Conservative Party should give back the Â£525,000 donated by Mohamed Amersi after the Pandora Papers revealed he was involved inone of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, says the Labour Party chairwoman. Anneliese Dodds says: ""It's really concerning that the Conservatives have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a man who appears to be closely linked to one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals.
"" She is calling for the party to ""return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access to the prime minister and the chancellor in return for cash"". ""There can't be one rule for senior Conservatives and their chums and another rule for everyone else,"" she says. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine is calling for the Electoral Commission to launch an immediate investigation into these allegations. ""The Tories must comply with this investigation and explain what they are doing to stop the flow of dirty money into the UK and apparently into their own party coffers,"" she says. Boris Johnson earlier said: ""All these donations are vetted in the normal way in accordance with the rules that were set up under a Labour government."" King Abdullah, seen here in 2019, has been married to Queen Rania since 1993 One of the world leaders featured in the Pandora Papers is
the King of Jordan, who used offshore companies to buy a string of properties
in the UK and US worth more than Â£79m ($106m). Abdullah
II bin Al-Hussein's palace says,externalhis 15 homes were bought in this way
""out of security and privacy concerns, and not out of secrecy or an
attempt to hide themâ. So who is the King of Jordan? King Abdullah has been in power for 22 years and is seen as
a moderate Western ally in the Middle East. The 59-year-old rules a countryof 10
million people,externaland has the power to appoint governments and approve
legislation. King Abdullah's sprawling property portfolio built up
between 2003 and 2017. At the same time, he has been accused of presiding over an
authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years amid
austerity measures and tax rises. Jordan isn't a wealthy country and receives international
aid. The British government is one of its biggest financial backers and is
giving Â£650m over five years. Annelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, says: ""It's
just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to achieve a basic level of
home and family, and a good job. ""So to have it really thrown in Jordaniansâ faces that
he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That would look really
bad."" King Abdullah's palace says the properties were âpersonally
fundedâ and international financial assistance is used for public purposes, as
agreed with the donor states. Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018 that he wanted fighting corruption and promoting transparency to be his legacy The Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting been like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed? There's limited coverage of the leak in Kenya,where the family of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The Star newspaper is leading with the story on its website, but others, including the Standard and the People Daily newspapers, did
not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. The country's leading daily newspaper, The Nation, published a story written by a news agency with the headline ""Pandora
Papers expose leaders' offshore millions"", using a picture of Jordan's
king. The story includes four lines about the Kenyattas. In Jordan -  where the Pandora Papers revealed thatKing Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US - stories on the leak were also notably absent; observers say local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. On Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately owned al-Ghad, al-Dustour andJordan Times,externalnewspapers were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Read more here. Governments in at least eight countries have announced investigations into the financial activities of both citizens and institutions following thePandora Papers revelations.,external Officials in Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Australia and Panama are promising inquiries, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported.,external The ICIJ is the organisation that obtained the data leak and shared it with media partners around the world, including the BBC. The UK has not announced a formal investigation, but, earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""HMRC (HM Revenue & Customs) will look through those [documents] to see if there is anything we can learn."" Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a statementfollowing the revelation that his family secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades. The president says he is currently abroad and will give a comprehensive response when he returns. However, he adds that the Pandora Papers will ""go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe"". ""The movement of illicit funds, proceeds of crime and corruption thrive in an environment of secrecy and darkness,"" the statement says. ""The Pandora Papers and subsequent follow up audits will lift that veil of secrecy and darkness for those who can not explain their assets or wealth."" We've been bringing you the latest revelations from the Pandora Papers since the findings of the huge financial information leak was broadcast by the BBC and media organisations across the world yesterday. Here's what we've learned today:  Ecuadorâs president Guillermo Lasso  is insisting all of his investments are legal after the Pandora Papers revealed he operated through 14 offshore companies,most of them based in Panama. The companies were closed only after the leftist government of
Rafael Correa passed a law banning candidates from being the beneficial owners
of companies located in tax havens, according to El Universo newspaper, which
is part of the consortium digging into the Pandora Papers. According to the investigation, Mr Lasso -  a former banker who took office
earlier this year - replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments
to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017,
before becoming a presidential candidate. Reacting to the revelations, the president says 10 of the
offshore companies mentioned were already inactive, while he denies involvement
with the other four. He says all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, are
legal. Youâll see the term âoffshoreâ in many of our stories about the Pandora Papers. This is because the papers have revealed complicated networks of companies that have been set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets, such as houses.For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries - or âoffshoreâ. There are several legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries - including protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments.Although having secretive offshore assets isnât illegal in itself, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality.Loopholes in the law also allow people tolegallyavoid paying some taxes by moving their money to or setting up companies in these places - sometimes called tax havens. While not illegal, itâs often seen as unethical. The Pandora Papers investigation is the largest ever organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists â theyâre the group that looked into a string of other leaks you mightâve heard of including theFinCen Files(2020),ParadisePapers (2017) andPanamaPapers (2016). âThereâs never been anything on this scale,â says Fergus Shiel, the ICIJâs managing editor.âIt shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax."" And his colleague Gerard Ryle says: âWe are talking about some of the most famous people in the world that are in these documents. Presidents, prime ministers, government ministersâ¦ âWeâre not looking at a couple of million dollars here. Weâre looking at trillions of dollars.â A businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal, the leaked Pandora Papers show. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. The BBC investigation into the files shows he secretly benefitted from the alleged $4bn fraud in Russia. His lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. Read the full storyhere. Most income comes in the form of donations, including those from individuals and companies. To give money as an individual you have to appear on a UK electoral register. Companies must be registered in the UK and carry out business in the country. Other sources of income for parties include membership fees, loans and a limited amount of public money. A vast majority of the Conservative Party's donations come from individuals: 68% during the 2019 election campaign. The Labour Party's income looks different. During the 2019 general election campaign, 93% of donations came from trade unions. National parties only have to record donations above Â£7,500, so the totals don't pick up the large base of Labour supporters who give small amounts.

"A prominent Tory donor who contributed to Boris Johnson's leadership campaign was involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, a BBC investigation has discovered. Mohamed Amersi has given nearly Â£525,000 to the party since 2018. Leaked documents reveal how he worked on a series of controversial deals for a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined $965m (Â£700m) in a US prosecution. Mr Amersi denies any wrongdoing. The 61-year-old is a corporate lawyer who worked as a consultant for Telia between 2007 and 2013. Working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has obtained documents that show how Mr Amersi was involved in a controversial $220m payment to a secretive offshore company in 2010. The firm was controlled by Gulnara Karimova - the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan - and the payment was described by the US authorities as a ""$220m bribe"". Mr Amersi's lawyers said the offshore company had been ""vetted and approved by Telia"" and that its involvement ""did not raise any red flags"" to him. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks Questions about the sources of Mr Amersi's wealth come as the Conservative Party's annual conference is under way in Manchester. His donations have included more than Â£100,000 towards the 2019 general election campaign and Â£10,000 to the prime minister's leadership bid. Mr Amersi's Russian-born partner, Nadezhda Rodicheva, has also donated money to the Conservatives - more than Â£250,000 in 2017 and 2018. Political law expert Gavin Millar QC believes the Conservatives should return the money. ""I think they should give it backâ¦ if serious questions are being asked about the donor,"" he said. But Mr Millar added ""the bottom line is they don't have to, and there's nothing in the law or the regulation of our system that compels them to do that"". The main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years. Why are donations to political parties often so controversial? At the moment individual donors only need to be on the UK electoral register. Once a party has checked that, they can accept as much money as they like. Mr Millar said: ""You would have thoughtâ¦ that there should be some sort of obligation placed on them in law, to enquire a little bit into where that large sum of money comes from. In recent months, Mr Amersi has been drawn into a ""cash for access"" row centred around claims that high-spending Tory donors were able to gain regular meetings with the prime minister and chancellor. A company owned by Gulnara Karimova was linked to the deal Mr Amersi's name is featured in a leak of almost 12 million documents and files known as the Pandora Papers. They detail the workings of offshore financial firms in locations including the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Singapore. On Sunday, the BBC revealed how documents showed the King of Jordan amassed a secret property empire, and the Azerbaijani president and his associates have been involved in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m. The leaked documents also showed how the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property for Â£6.45 million in an offshore deal that saved them Â£312,000 in stamp duty. The documents show Mr Amersi purchased two properties in the UK - a Mayfair townhouse and country home in Gloucestershire using secretive offshore companies. Further investigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated Mr Amersi was involved in negotiations that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company. The firm was secretly owned through an offshore company by Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov. Telia had given her shares in one of its companies in 2007 and three years later agreed to buy most of the stock back for $220m - amove US authorities described in a criminal prosecution as a ""bribe payment...,externalin order to continue its telecoms business in Uzbekistan"". Telia was seeking new mobile operating licences for its business in the country at the time, and prosecutors say Ms Karimova - a one-time pop star and UN ambassador - had ""influence"" with the Uzbek regulator. The incident formed part of the case brought by the US Department of Justice against Telia and some of its officials. The proceedings were settled in 2017 without going to trial after Telia agreed to pay a penalty of more than $965m and accepted responsibility for breaking anti-corruption laws. Telia officials were charged in Sweden over their dealings with Ms Karimova - butthey were acquitted,externalafter a court ruled that the country's bribery laws did not apply in the case. Mr Amersi with his partner Nadezhda Rodicheva and the Duchess of Cornwall at a charity fashion show in 2018 British citizen born in Kenya to a family from an Iranian-Indian background Educated in the UK - studied medicine and law at Sheffield and Cambridge universities Described on the website of his charitable foundation as a ""renowned global communications entrepreneur, philanthropist and thought leader"" Spoken out against corruption in speeches Recently faced opposition from some Conservatives over his decision to set up a group to help run the party's relationships in the Middle East Internal Telia emails seen by the BBC connect Mr Amersi to the company's dealings with Ms Karimova's offshore firm Takilant. One message shows a Telia executive wrote to Mr Amersi, saying: ""I do not want to be involved on day to day negotiations so maybe you... can handle it"". Mr Amersi responded: ""Sure... I agree."" An invoice for his ""success fees"" for ""Project Uzbekistan"" - for $500,000 - is among the internal Telia documents. Panorama has also obtained evidence about how Mr Amersi was involved in other deals for Telia. Leaked details from an internal company report describe the activities of a consultant referred to as Mr XY who was paid more than $65m over six years. The payments included expenses for ""lavish corporate entertainment"" - usually between $100,000 and $200,000 a month - that were not  evidenced by receipts. The report states that some of the payments to Mr XY ""may have been utilised to improperly acquire regulatory benefits and/or secure the go-ahead of transactions"". It recommended that Telia's relationship with Mr XY be terminated. Former Telia executive Michaela Ahlberg, who was brought in to clean up the company, told Panorama that Mr Amersi was the consultant referred to in the report. ""It is important that people around him, that trust him, that listen to him, understand the whole context of his career, and wealth,"" she said. Ms Ahlberg said: ""He has been involved in one of the biggest corruption scandals that we have seen in Sweden in modern times. Panorama has confirmed that Mr Amersi was the ""adviser"" referred to at Telia's annual general meeting in 2014 as having had ""agreements"" with the company terminated after ""certain transactions in Eurasia"". In the AGM speech, Telia's then chief mentioned the ""inadequate governance"" of its Eurasian operations and operations ""not aligned with [Telia's] ethical requirements"", as well as ""questionable lobbying activitiesâ¦ on behalf"" of Telia. Telia has since exited central Asia and divested all of its business there to concentrate on its Scandinavian and northern European businesses and made changes to its corporate governance. It says it has now committed itself to transparency and openness. Mr Amersi's lawyers say it is ""entirely false"" to suggest his contract was terminated.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations.

"For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The furlough scheme was the centrepiece ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's ""unprecedented"" interventionin the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus. It protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. Now that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go. During the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially. That doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time. According todata from HM Revenue & Customs,external(HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown. Since then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC. ""To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,"" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020. Although he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdroppinga Â£30bn package to boost the economyand get the country through the virus outbreak. But it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month. Under the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves Overall it cost the government nearly Â£70bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a ""great success"", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment. While workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough. Younger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail. Since March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme. Some sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others. With pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed. And non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash. People working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life. The scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. However over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end. In recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen. The Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as ""a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention"". But its recent research,externalsuggested there remained a ""real risk"" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers. And doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme. It has drawn fire fromthe Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency. The committee has spoken dismissively of ""hastily drawn up economic support schemes"" that provided ""unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers"". HMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. Apart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities. The number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors. Some have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers.

"Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been suspended as investors await a statement about its future. The crisis at the world's most indebted property developer has triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets. The firm said the trade halt came ahead of ""an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction"". It comes amid reports that a rival real estate firm is reportedly set to buy a majority stake in an Evergrande unit. In a regulatory statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,external, Evergrande Group said that its shares had been suspended from trading ""pending the release by the Company of an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction."" What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail? Meanwhile, rival Hong Kong-listed property firm Hopson Development is set to buy a 51% stake in Evergrande Real Estate for around $5bn, according to Chinese news outlet Cailian Press. Hopson has not yet commented on the report but has suspended trading in its shares, pending an announcement""in relation to a major transaction"",external. Evergrande's problems have rocked markets over concerns about its more than $300bn (Â£222bn) of debt. The firm's shares have fallen by almost 80% since the start of this year. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng share index ended Monday's trading session 2.2% lower. In recent weeks Evergrande has struggled to make payments to investors in its bonds and wealth management products. Last Thursday, the cash-strapped group said that its wealth management business had made a 10% repayment on its products , which are mainly owned by Chinese retail investors,. That contrasts with reports of overseas bondholders saying the company had failed to make interest payments by the date they were due. The hugely indebted property giant reportedly missed interest payments to overseas investors last week for the second time in a matter of days. It was due to pay foreign bond holders $47.5m by Wednesday. But bondholders told Reuters news agency and Bloomberg that they were yet to receive any payment. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before the missed payments officially become a default. Evergrande has interest debt payments of more than $160m due in the next month. The company has been taking steps in recent weeks to raise money owed to customers, investors and suppliers. Last week, it said it was selling a $1.5bn stake it owned in a commercial bank. The almost 20% stake in Shengjing Bank was bought by a state-owned asset management company. Under the agreement, the proceeds of the sale are to be used to pay money Evergrande owes to Shengjing Bank, which is one of the main lenders to the heavily-indebted firm. The company's total liabilities are equal to around 2% of China's gross domestic product.
