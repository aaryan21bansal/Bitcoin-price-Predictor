"Newcastle manager Steve Bruce and owner Mike Ashley have spoken out about the pay-per-view fixtures The Premier League is likely to scrap the controversial pay-per-view method for matches after November's international window. Clubs will instead look to devise a new solution that will cover the Christmas period. A definitive decision was not taken at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday but discussions are said to be ongoing. However, the Â£14.95 fee - which led to significant protests among fan groups - is expected to be dropped. It is understood the model used in September, when all games were shown live by the Premier League's broadcast partners, is the likely direction of travel. Pay-per-view remains on the table but a final decision is not expected this week. In a statement, the Premier League said shareholders met on Thursday ""to discuss a number of important issues"", including the broadcast options for matches following the international break. ""Discussions with all stakeholders are ongoing and a broadcast solution will be announced in due course,"" it added. More than Â£300,000 has been raised for charity by fans boycotting pay-per-view games, whichwere introduced in Octoberafter clubs voted 19-1 in favour of the ""interim solution"". Liverpool's fan group the Spirit of Shankly described the decision to charge Â£14.95 as ""disgraceful"", while the Football Supporters' Association said many fans were ""concerned"" over the price and wanted it reduced. Following Thursday's meeting, an FSA spokesperson said: ""Supporters made clear their revulsion at the Â£15 cost to see their teams on Sky and BT Sport's pay-per-view platforms last month, an emotion running so deep that fan protests across the country even reached the ears of untouchable Premier League club owners. ""We await to see the detail of what the Premier League and its broadcasters will now offer supporters who remain locked out of grounds for the foreseeable future - they simply must come up with a solution that is affordable for all."" Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and manager Steve Bruce havesaid the fee for one-off matches is too high,while former Manchester United and England right-back Gary Neville, now a Sky pundit, said the system ""just needs scrapping"". Pay-per-view will still be used for this weekend's fixtures, for games not selected for regular television broadcast, and whatever decision is made would come into force from 21 November and is due to last for the rest of the year. Last month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said the Â£14.95 fee was ""defensible"", and the announcement of the model came at a time when top-flight clubs were lobbying for spectators to be allowed back into grounds. However, England has since entered a second national lockdown, which will last until 2 December, and hopes of an imminent return of fans have faded. In September, all 28 Premier League matches were shown live, with all broadcast partners - Sky Sports, BT Sport, the BBC and Amazon Prime - screening matches. Meanwhile, the Premier League said its shareholders also reiterated that a rescue package remains on the table for EFL clubs suffering financially during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The offer guarantees no EFL club need go out of business as a result of the pandemic in the 2020-21 season, and our intention is to play an active role in helping clubs return to financial stability,"" it said in a statement. ""The Premier League will engage directly with any EFL club that is suffering severe financial losses due to the pandemic, and will remain in dialogue with the EFL on this important issue. ""The rescue package is on top of solidarity payments totalling Â£110m already advanced to the EFL this season, alongside additional financial support for youth development and community programmes.""

"This video can not be played A woman was arrested after removing her mother, who has dementia, from her care home A retired nurse was arrested after she removed her 97-year-old mother from a care home before lockdown began. Ylenia Angeli, 73, said she took ""drastic action"" due to a lack of face-to-face contact during the pandemic. She said she wanted to care for her mother, who has dementia, herself. She was returned to the home and Ms Angeli was released without further action. Humberside Police said it was called to reports of an assault. The care home has declined to comment. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said they ""understand how difficult the current situation is"" and would be publishing new guidance to enable more visits to take place in a safe and ""Covid-secure"" environment. Ms Angeli, from Market Weighton, was later de-arrested and the force said it was their ""legal duty"" to return her mother to the care home. The incident took place on Tuesday as Ms Angeli visited her mother with her daughter, former Coronation Street actress Leandra Ashton, who filmed the arrest. Ms Ashton said her mother, who previously lived in Shetland, had been pushed to ""breaking point"" because they had been unable to see her grandmother for nine months. She said: ""When we got there things just escalated. We didn't plan it, it was just a moment of high emotions."" Leandra Ashton said care home restrictions on seeing family had meant her grandmother's condition had deteriorated Ms Ashton said the family had been allowed ""window visits"" or Skype calls but these had caused too much distress to her grandmother. ""Because the home are now stopping window visits due to the lockdown, we we were desperate to see her,"" she explained. ""My mum has wanted to look after for her for a very long time and it just seemed like an opportunity to physically take her."" Ms Ashton, from York, appeared in Coronation Street in 2016 as Saskia Larson, whose fiance Will Chatterton had an affair with wedding planner Michelle Connor. She said the family only had power of attorney over her grandmother's finances but not her health and wellbeing. What can you do during England's new lockdown? Coronavirus and care homes ""Every attempt to see my Nan has been met with inflexibility,"" she said. ""Other homes have been creative in how they've allowed relatives to visit but we've just constantly hit a brick wall. ""These are such desperate times and there doesn't seem to be a rational explanation as to why we can't find a safe way."" In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Chris Noble, of Humberside Police, said the force responded to ""a report of an assault at a care home"" in Market Weighton at 11:15 GMT on Tuesday. He added: ""The care home had also reported that a woman who they were legally responsible for had been taken from the home by her daughter. ""Officers found both women along with a third woman nearby and informed them that they would need to return the lady to the home, as is their legal duty to do so. ""The situation was distressing and emotional for everyone and the woman did not want her mother to be returned to the care home staff."" ACC Noble said officers ""briefly"" restrained Mrs Agneli until the situation was under control. The spokesman at Downing Street said there was not a ""one-size-fits all answer unfortunately"" to whether families could take their loved ones out of care homes.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme to March The furlough scheme will be extended across the UK until the end of March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed. Mr Sunak said the scheme will pay up to 80% of a person's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. He told the Commons that the government will review the policy in January. The chancellor said his intention was ""to give businesses security through the winter"". ""The security we are providing will protect millions of jobs,"" he added. The furlough scheme, or Job Retention Scheme, subsidises the wages of people who cannot do their jobs, either because their workplace is closed or because there is no longer enough work for them. Mr Sunak said it would apply throughout the UK, saying the country had ""a Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Coronavirus: Am I eligible for the extended furlough scheme? Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting? As part of the revised scheme, anyone made redundant after 23 September can be rehired and put back on furlough. The Job Support Scheme - a less generous form of support that had originally been set to replace the furlough scheme in November - has now been postponed. Mr Sunak also announced billions of pounds of other support for the economy, including more money for self-employed people. Support through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will be increased, with the third grant covering November to January calculated at 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of Â£7,500. At the same time, the chancellor raised guaranteed funding for the UK's devolved administrations by Â£2bn to Â£16bn. But, many people will remain ineligible for help, including the newly self-employed, those whose pay themselves in dividends, freelancers, and sole traders who previously had a trading profit of more than Â£50,000. Chef Louise Solomon, 49, is going back on furlough from midnight and says she feels ""a huge sense of relief"". She says without the support, she and her wife, a key worker, would only have lasted a few months before things got tight. ""I have card loans, and companies want to be paid regardless. I'd probably have to sell my car and look at what else I could get rid of."" Instead, the furlough extension has given her some breathing space. ""It gives you that security - you can sleep at night, knowing money is coming in."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of ignoring objections to the government's measures ""until the last possible moment"". She pointed out that he had previously ""ridiculed"" a furlough extension as ""a blunt instrument"". But Mr Sunak defended his rapid change of policy, saying: ""It is not a weakness to be fast-moving in a crisis, but rather a strength."" Alison Thewliss, the Scottish National Party's Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, described the ""long-overdue Tory U-turn"" as ""welcome"", but said it came after six months of sustained pressure from the SNP and devolved governments. Northern Ireland Finance Minister Conor Murphy welcomed the new support, but said it was ""regrettable"" that repeated calls to extend the furlough scheme ""had not been answered sooner"". This is a change of heart from ministers - and a really significant one. The chancellor and the prime minister did not want to be here. The furlough scheme was due to end at the start of November. At the weekend, we found out it would last until 2 December. Now it's staying until the end of March. The government will argue it is necessary because of a changing health picture. They are clearly worried about the economic outlook. But political opponents have been calling for this for some time and they believe the chancellor has waited too long. The Treasury has said anyone who was made redundant after 23 September - when the furlough replacement was announced - can be brought back on to the scheme. But the government will face accusations it should have done this sooner. The latest announcement follows several days of wrangling over the scope and duration of the furlough scheme. It was due to end on 31 October, but was then extended to cover the new four-week lockdown in England. That announcement at the weekend sparked a row with Scotland and Wales, which argued that it was unfair for the full support package to be available only when England is in lockdown. They said the scheme should be on offer if they went into their own full national lockdowns later on. England entered a second lockdown on Thursday until 2 December The Treasury has not put a cost on extending the furlough initiative until March, as it will depend on the take-up of the scheme, However, it suggests a rule of thumb of Â£1bn a month, per million who use it. So three million furloughed workers would cost Â£3bn a month. The furlough scheme has cost more than Â£50bn so far. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support did not go far enough, particularly for the self-employed, and suggested it had been ""dreamt up on the hoof"".

However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said extending the furlough scheme and the self-employment grant to the end of March provided ""important support to the UK economy at a time of heightened uncertainty"". Heathrow airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: ""Whilst we welcome the extension of the furlough scheme, we are clear that it doesn't go far enough for an aviation sector that has been on its knees since March."" He said the sector was being ignored by the government, adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of families across the UK that rely on jobs in aviation to pay the bills have no other choice than to feel very alone."" Mr Sunak's statement comes after theBank of England said it was pumping an extra Â£150bn into the economy. The Bank warned the resurgence of Covid-19 would lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Just as the last furlough scheme extended long beyond the date that some businesses were allowed to reopen, so we should not infer that furlough till March means lockdown in England till March. The current measures for England will be lifted on 2 December, but are likely to be replaced by a form of the regional tier system in place until now. One of the interesting things to watch in the coming weeks will be the effect of lockdown measures on the infection rates. The hard-hit hospitality industry, in particular, has argued vehemently that the evidence that pubs, bars and restaurants are a major spreader of infection is very thin. Does shutting hospitality make a huge difference to the spread of infection? The industry says we are about to find out. The furlough scheme was introduced in March and was originally intended to end in May, but Mr Sunak said at the outset that it would be extended ""if necessary"". About 9.6 million people have benefited at one time or another, with a steep take-up in the first few months. However, some have questioned whether all the money has been wisely spent. HM Revenue and Customs, which administers the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August - some Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. It is also unclear whether it has genuinely safeguarded viable jobs or merely delayed the inevitable disappearance of unviable ones. What is your experience of the furlough scheme?

"Uber's food delivery business is booming Uber's food delivery business has more than doubled, as the pandemic increases appetite for online grocery orders and restaurant takeaway. The firm said revenue from its Uber Eats service hit $1.4bn (Â£1bn) in the three months to 30 September, jumping 124% from the same period in 2019. The growth helped offset steep declines in the firm's core rides business. But Uber still recorded a loss of about $1.1bn in the quarter, roughly the same as last year. Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said demand for food delivery has stayed strong even as countries lift restrictions, a promising sign for growth in the Uber Eats business. ""We've got more eaters, they're staying longer, they're eating more,"" he told investors on a conference call to discuss the firm's quarterly results. ""There's no question in my mind that ... there's a fundamental behavioural shift that has gone on,"" he added later. ""People aren't going to stop using Amazon. People aren't going to stop using Eats."" The growth in delivery marked a stark contrast to the firm's ride-hailing business. There, Uber said bookings and revenue for its taxi service remained roughly half of last year's levels, despite improvement since the spring. Demand has recovered most in Europe, while lagging in the US and Canada, its most important market, executives said. They warned that the resurgence in Covid cases in Europe and new restrictions in countries like the UK and France would likely hit demand in coming months.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said there was 'light at the end of the tunnel' as a new lockdown began in England The prime minister has stressed that people in England should stay at home, as a second lockdown begins. Boris Johnson said he knew people were weary but four weeks of measures would make a ""real impact"" on the virus. Pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops were forced to close on Thursday as part of the new restrictions. Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the furlough scheme to support jobswould be extended across the UK until the end of March. Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street, Mr Johnson said the measures were ""not a repeat of the spring"" and there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He said the restrictions in England would ""automatically expire"" on 2 December. There is expected to be another vote on the next steps needed to tackle the virus before the lockdown ends. What can you do during England's new lockdown? The last thing I bought before lockdown 2.0 He added that although the challenge was ""significant across the UK"", the devolved nations were working together on a ""joint approach"", with the objective of having ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". The devolved nations each make their own restrictions with Wales currently in a 17-day firebreak lockdown, while Scotland is in atier systemand Northern Ireland in the midst of afour-week limited lockdown. In addition to the extension of the furlough scheme, the prime minister said a further Â£1.1bn will be made available for local authorities to support businesses, with Â£2bn for the devolved nations. He said the government will also put Â£15m towards a scheme to help to provide accommodation for rough sleepers during the pandemic. This money is part of funding previously announced by the government to tackle homelessness. Mr Johnson said by September the government had supported more than 29,000 vulnerable people, with two thirds now moved into settled accommodation. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The UK recorded a further 378 coronavirus deaths and 24,141 confirmed cases on Thursday. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, who appeared alongside the prime minister, said about 30,000 staff in the health service were either off with coronavirus or were having to self-isolate, and ""that has an impact"". ""This second wave of coronavirus is real and it's serious,"" he said. ""The health service has been working incredibly hard to prepare and to catch up on the care that was disrupted during the first wave."" This video can not be played Sir Simon Stevens said hospitals were filling up across Europe, including in the UK Sir Simon added it will be known ""conclusively"" by the end of the second national lockdown whether it had affected the increase in Covid-19 hospital admissions, but said the NHS was ""hoping and expecting"" they would not see the increases that infectious disease experts had warned about. Earlier, the UK Statistics Authoritycriticised the way data has been presentedby the government to justify England's second lockdown, highlighting the use of modelling in a TV briefing on Saturday showing the possible death toll from Covid this winter. Shunning projections that have proved so controversial, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens tried to play it straight at the news briefing. He presented a chart showing how the numbers in hospital have gone up since the summer with more than 11,000 in hospital in England. He then provided some important context - comparing that to the numbers in hospital with flu - around 3,000 in the depths of winter - or getting treatment for cancer, normally 7,000. This shows the burden Covid is placing on the health service. But two things that were not shown were the numbers in hospital at the peak in the spring - 17,000 - or the number of free beds, thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We don't know the latter because NHS bosses are not publishing them. An important point on the day thatthe UK Statistics Authority called for greater transparency over the way Covid datais presented. Unlike the first national lockdown in March, schools, universities, and nurseries will remain open, and people will be able to meet another person who they do not live with in an outdoor public place such as a park or beach. The rules say people cannot mix with anyone they do not live with indoors or in private gardens and people should stay at home except for specific reasons including education and work, if it cannot be done from home.

England entered a second lockdown on Thursday until 2 December The Treasury has not put a cost on extending the furlough initiative until March, as it will depend on the take-up of the scheme, However, it suggests a rule of thumb of Â£1bn a month, per million who use it. So three million furloughed workers would cost Â£3bn a month. The furlough scheme has cost more than Â£50bn so far. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support did not go far enough, particularly for the self-employed, and suggested it had been ""dreamt up on the hoof"".

However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said extending the furlough scheme and the self-employment grant to the end of March provided ""important support to the UK economy at a time of heightened uncertainty"". Heathrow airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: ""Whilst we welcome the extension of the furlough scheme, we are clear that it doesn't go far enough for an aviation sector that has been on its knees since March."" He said the sector was being ignored by the government, adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of families across the UK that rely on jobs in aviation to pay the bills have no other choice than to feel very alone."" Mr Sunak's statement comes after theBank of England said it was pumping an extra Â£150bn into the economy. The Bank warned the resurgence of Covid-19 would lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Just as the last furlough scheme extended long beyond the date that some businesses were allowed to reopen, so we should not infer that furlough till March means lockdown in England till March. The current measures for England will be lifted on 2 December, but are likely to be replaced by a form of the regional tier system in place until now. One of the interesting things to watch in the coming weeks will be the effect of lockdown measures on the infection rates. The hard-hit hospitality industry, in particular, has argued vehemently that the evidence that pubs, bars and restaurants are a major spreader of infection is very thin. Does shutting hospitality make a huge difference to the spread of infection? The industry says we are about to find out. The furlough scheme was introduced in March and was originally intended to end in May, but Mr Sunak said at the outset that it would be extended ""if necessary"". About 9.6 million people have benefited at one time or another, with a steep take-up in the first few months. However, some have questioned whether all the money has been wisely spent. HM Revenue and Customs, which administers the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August - some Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. It is also unclear whether it has genuinely safeguarded viable jobs or merely delayed the inevitable disappearance of unviable ones. What is your experience of the furlough scheme?

"Hundreds of musicians staged a protest outside Parliament in early October The government has been urged to do more to help performers and other arts freelancers as venues are shut again during lockdowns in England and Wales. Labour MP Chris Elmore told the House of Commons there were ""growing numbers of freelancers, musicians, performance artists who are excluded"" from support. Theatre workers face ""adding to the queues at food banks"", another MP said. Arts minister Caroline Dinenage said the government was ""working very hard"" to help freelancers access support. She said Arts Council England had allocated Â£119m for individuals, on top of the Â£1.57bn available to venues in England through the government's Culture Recovery Fund. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden acknowledged that a third of freelancers in all walks of life had not been able to access the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, which the government confirmed on Thursday would be extended to cover 80% of average trading profits. ""I understand the many challenges faced by freelancers and I hear about it every day,"" Mr Dowden said. ""It is the case that across the economy 66% of freelancers are able to benefit from the Treasury scheme, whichhas been increased again by the chancellor."" Responding to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement, Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians,said she was ""delighted"",externalbut that ""expanding the eligibility criteria remains essential for preventing an exodus of highly skilled talent from our world-leading arts sector"". The Musicians' Union said,externalthe extension of SEISS was ""fantastic news for many of our members"", but added that it was ""time to close the gaps in support"" that it said 38% of musicians had fallen through. The Equity performers' union has said 40% of members were ineligible for SEISS, andwarned last week,externalthat ""the trickle of lost talent will become a flood"". 'I swing between anger, hope, despair' Hundreds of musicians protest outside Parliament What help are self-employed people getting? Speaking in the House of Commons earlier on Thursday,Labour MP Ruth Cadbury said,externalshe had been contacted by West End performers,make-up artists, instrumentalists and others who had been struggling to survive on benefits after being ineligible for other support. ""Here in west London, Universal Credit barely [covers] or fails to cover the cost of rent, meaning they now face going through lockdown with no additional support and adding to the queues at food banks,"" she said. Mr Elmore said: ""There are growing numbers of freelancers, musicians, performance artists who are excluded from getting any support from governmentâ¦ and there are growing numbers of organisations calling for support specifically for musicians."" In response, Ms Dinenage said: ""Our world-beating cultural and creative industries are absolutely nothing without the people who work in them, and we're working very hard to help freelancers in those sectors to access support, particularly if they don't qualify for the SEISS. ""Arts Council England has made Â£119m available to individuals, Â£23m of that has already been distributed and about Â£96m is still available to apply for."" She added that the Culture Recovery Fund would ""benefit freelancers because it does enable organisations to be assisted to reopen, and to restart performances, maybe in a digital or live stream capacity"". The National Audit Office reported,externallast month that up to 2.9 million people had fallen through the cracks of the furlough and SEISS schemes. Also in October, the charity Help Musicians published the results of a survey saying more than half of musicians were not earning anything at all from music, and that four in five were worried about being able to pay their household bills. Before the latest lockdown, 22% of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry had temporarily closed or paused trading - more than in any other sector; and the industry had the highest proportion of its workforce on furlough, at 27%,according to the Office For National Statistics,external. Meanwhile on Thursday, singer Van Morrison launched The Lockdown Financial Hardship Fund for musicians, and started a petition calling on the Northern Ireland Executive to provide a timeline for live music to resume.

"Teams in protective kit for the cull - usually mink are gassed with carbon monoxide Danish authorities have said a lockdown will be introduced in some areas over a coronavirus mutation found in mink that can spread to humans. The government has warned that the effectiveness of any future vaccine could be affected by the mutation. Bars, restaurants, public transport and all public indoor sports will be closed in seven North Jutland municipalities. The restrictions will come into effect from Friday and initially last until 3 December. It comes soon after an announcement that Denmark would cull all its mink - as many as 17 million. The Scandinavian country is the world's biggest producer of mink fur and its main export markets are China and Hong Kong. Culling began late last month, after many mink cases were detected. On Thursday, the World Health Organization said mink appear to be ""good reservoirs"" of coronavirus. It also commended Denmark's ""determination and courage"" for going ahead with the culls, despite the economic impact it would bring. There are more than 1,000 mink farms in Denmark Coronavirus cases have been detected in other farmed mink in the Netherlands and Spain since the pandemic began in Europe. But cases are spreading fast in Denmark - 207 mink farms in Jutland are affected - and at least five cases of the new virus strain were found.

"Dominic Chappell was not of ""positive good character"", prosecutors said Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion. A Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of failing to pay tax of around Â£584,000 on Â£2.2m of income he received after buying the failed chain for Â£1. The court heard the 53-year-old spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday to the Bahamas. Chappell's lawyers claimed he became ""utterly broke"" after BHS's ""pension problem exploded"" in 2015. Mr Chappell controversially bought the retailer from tycoon Sir Philip Green that year, but the chain collapsed soon after in 2016. It led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Five issues at the heart of the BHS story 'I was in charge of millions, then I had nothing' In sentencing, the judge said Chappell had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"". ""You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies,"" he said. Simon York, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: ""This was deliberate theft from UK citizens. Chappell was a high-profile businessman who knew tax had to be paid on his income and profits but chose not to do so. ""That's money that should have been supporting our vital public services instead of funding his lavish lifestyle."" BHS fell into administration in 2016 BHS, once one of Britain's best known retailers, was losing Â£1m a week and had a huge pension deficit when Chappell's consortium, Retail Acquisitions, bought it in 2015. In his year of ownership Mr Chappell received Â£2.5m in payments from BHS , largely for consultancy fees provided by another of his companies, the bankrupt finance firm Swiss Rock Limited. Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised for agreeing to the deal, andlater agreed a Â£363m cash settlementwith the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme. However, on Thursday prosecutors condemned Chappell for spending large sums of money at a time when he should have been trying to save BHS. ""Chappell purchased the struggling retail chain for just Â£1 and was paid thousands of pounds in his new role, where he was tasked with avoiding more redundancies,"" said crown prosecutor Andrew Fox. ""Instead, while the company fell further into financial difficulty, he spent his new income lavishly on luxury breaks abroad and expensive yachts."" The court heard Chappell, a former racing driver, also bought Â£11,000 worth of items from a gun and outdoor wear shop, including expensive Beretta firearms. Prosecutors said HMRC repeatedly tried to chase down the missing funds, but Chappell ignored their requests, at one point going on a skiing break before asking for more time to pay the money when he returned home. In his defence, Chappell argued he was too busy resolving issues with BHS to deal with the outstanding taxes that were due. He had denied three charges of tax fraud. Earlier this year Chappell wasordered to pay Â£9.5m into BHS pension schemesafter losing an appeal. And in 2019 the Government's Insolvency Service banned him from running a company for 10 years, saying he had carried out ""reckless financial transactions"" and ""failed to maintain adequate company records"".

"As President Trump continues to dispute the result of the US election, false or misleading posts have been spreading on social media about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who have called into question the integrity of the election without providing evidence. We've checked some of the main claims. Viral tweets alleged that dead people were casting votes in the key state of Michigan, adding to a Trump-led chorus of unproven ""voter fraud"" claims. Michigan authorities have hit back,external, calling the rumours ""misinformation"" - and noting that votes from dead people are rejected. The viral tweets supposedly identified people who had cast an absentee ballot despite being born at the turn of the century and having passed away. One of the men in the posts seems to have been mixed up with his father, now deceased. The men had the same name and address,according to the Politifact website,external. Local officials in Michigan told the site that the son's ballot was erroneously attributed to the father on the official voting system. We've seen other isolated cases of allegations of ""dead people"" voting - most also explained by family members with the same name, or technical hitches, such as voters being instructed to enter a dummy date of birth if they can't initially find their voter registration record online. The rumours have been repeated by influential accounts, including those of the president's son Don Jr - who of course also shares a name with his father - and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Posts are being widely shared online suggesting a glitch in the vote counting software used in Michigan led to thousands of ballots cast for Donald Trump being counted for Joe Biden. The claims have made their way onto the president's Twitter - retweeting Republican Senator Ted Cruz suggesting there could be a problem with the software used across the state. There was a problem in one county where votes were initially incorrectly reported for Mr Biden, whichMichigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said,external""was quickly identified and corrected"". She added the initial mistake was a human error, not a software error. Viral posts currently circulating claim there could be the same issue in 47 other counties in Michigan where the same software is used. Mrs Benson said: ""There is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state."" Another widespread rumour emerged during the count in the battleground state of Arizona. Tweets alleged there was a scheme to discount votes in pro-Republican parts of the state by distributing Sharpie pens - permanent markers - for people to fill in their ballots. In one widely circulated video, a woman describes how voting machines supposedly can't read ballots marked with this type of pen. The person behind the camera says votes aren't being counted and that people are being forced to use Sharpie pens to skew the vote total. This led to a surge of activity on social media, claims of voter fraud and that large numbers of votes from Trump supporters were being invalidated. CNN reported that a group of protesters that gathered in Maricopa County in Arizona were ""shouting about the sharpie social media misinformation."" But the claims are false. Maricopa County officials said Sharpiesdo not invalidate ballots,external. The Arizona secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, confirmed on Twitter that if you voted in person ""your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!"".

Ms Hobbs later told CNN ""even if the machines can't read them for some reason, a marker bled through to the other side, we have ways to count them. They're going to be counted. There is absolutely no merit to saying that this was some conspiracy to invalidate Republican ballots."" A map of voting in Michigan from the election night - which shows a sudden increase of around 130,000 votes for Joe Biden, but none for Mr Trump - has gone viral on social media. President Trump has tweeted the image, which is raising speculation about voter fraud. It's commonplace that state authorities will add a big chunk of votes to a tally at once. But social media users were questioning why Mr Trump didn't have any votes added to his tally in this particular update. The explanation is simple - it was a data entry error that was later corrected. Decision Desk, the election monitoring website which created the map, said: ""It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingestedâ¦ the state noticed the error and produced an updated count."" Ballot challengers trying to get into a count in Detroit, Michigan The spokesperson added: ""This sort of thing can happen on election night and we expect other vote tabulators in Michigan experienced this error and corrected in real-time like we did."" Twitter has added labels to the tweets that raised suspicions, saying: ""Some or all of the content shared in this tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process."" Matt Mackowiak, the user whose post was picked up by Mr Trump, has deleted the tweet and apologised - although the image remains widely shared elsewhere. Allow Twitter content?

In the early hours of Wednesday, the map was propelled by supporters of the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon and to a wider audience by conservative influencers online. When we contacted Michigan's Bureau of Elections, they said they didn't have a comment on the data discrepancy,  but said the results were at this stage ""unofficial"" and not the final count. There have been widespread false claims that more people in Wisconsin voted than were registered. A user tweeted: ""BREAKING: Wisconsin has more votes than people who are registered to vote. Total number of registered voters: 3,129,000. Total number of votes cast: 3,239,920. This is direct evidence of fraud."" However, this number of registered voters is outdated - thelatest figure,externalas of 1 November is 3,684,726. That tweet has now been deleted, but people on Facebook and Twitter continue to share a screenshot of the post. Voter turnout for Wisconsin is significantly higher at this election than in previous years. The state also allows people to register to vote on election day itself, which means the overall number of registered voters could be even higher than the current reported figure.

"Sainsbury's is to cut 3,500 jobs with the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all its meat, fish and deli counters. The 420 standalone Argos stores will close by March 2024, although Sainsbury's said it would open 150 Argos outlets in its supermarkets. Boss Simon Roberts said Sainsbury's was responding to changing consumer habits and the growth of online shopping. He said the counter closures was a response to lower customer demand and a desire to reduce food waste. The supermarket also reported half-year results, revealing a Â£137m loss which it blamed on closures and ""market changes"". It comes on the day England enters a second lockdown, which Sainsbury's said would continue to accelerate ""a number of shifts in our industry"" as it expands its online and digital operations. Argos axes 'book of dreams' after 48 years Coronavirus: Which shops will open in lockdown? Sainsbury's, which bought Argos in 2016,said in its statement,externalthat the 120 standalone Argos stores that had not reopened since they were closed in March would now shut permanently. By the end of the restructuring programme, Sainsbury's said it expected the total number of standalone Argos outlets to be about 100. The restructuring will save about Â£600m by 2024, the grocer said. In addition to the 150 Argos stores it plans to open in its supermarkets by 2024, it also plans a further 150-200 collection points. ""We are talking to colleagues today about where the changes we are announcing in Argos standalone stores and food counters impact their roles,"" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's chief executive. ""We will work really hard to find alternative roles for as many of these colleagues as possible and expect to be able to offer alternative roles for the majority of impacted colleagues."" He said the aim was to make Argos ""a simpler, more efficient and more profitable business"". Products from the Habitat brand will also be more widely available in the stores and via Argos. ""Our other brands - Argos, Habitat, Tu, Nectar and Sainsbury's Bank - must deliver for their customers and for our shareholders in their own right,"" he said. Despite the cutting of the 3,500 roles, the supermarket expects that it will have created about 6,000 net new jobs by the end of the year. Sainsbury's said it was responding to changing consumer demands However, the redundancies increase the mounting jobs toll announced by companies facing a coronavirus hit to trading. On Wednesday, John Lewis and Lloyds Banking Group said they were cutting a combined 2,500 jobs. More than 200,000 potential job losses have been announced across sectors including banking, hospitality, travel and retail since the start of Covid-19 pandemic in March. Thousands more workers remain on furlough. Despite Sainsbury's cost-cutting, the company said on Thursday it would pay out a special dividend of 7.3p to shareholders after strong sales in the face of Covid-19. Sainsbury's revealed that total like-for-like sales increased by 6.9% for the 28 weeks to 19 September, helped by an 8.2% growth in groceries.  The supermarket also said there had been ""stronger-than-expected sales, particularly at Argos"". Online sales more than doubled, jumping 117% to Â£5.8bn, as demand for online deliveries surged. Analysts said the Argos restructuring seemed sensible in the current climate, and Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, felt opening more in-store operations could be an ""ace in the hole"" this Christmas. ""The brand is synonymous with festive shopping for a generation of consumers, but it needs to ensure that the delivery service is able to meet demand in lockdown,"" she said. However, John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, said the announcement was an admission that the Â£1.4bn purchase of Argos was a mistake. ""The closure of a further 420... Argos stores says it all. Sainsbury's management clearly did not know how to run Argos and the plan to transplant into spare store space has not worked. ""There was always a concern that Argos and Sainsbury's appealed to very different customer segments with little overlap. That seems now to be true,"" he said. These Argos closures were on the cards long before the pandemic. When Sainsbury's bought the business in 2016, it was clear that hundreds of Argos stores would be closed and relocated inside Sainsbury's supermarkets. This integration is already well under way and it's easy to see why the business is accelerating these plans. Sales at Argos grew by 11% over the last six months despite all its stores being shut during lockdown. It doesn't need as many standalone Argos shops. The company says our shifting shopping habits is also behind the need to close its deli, fresh fish and meat counters. Counters aren't cheap to run and demand, it says, has been falling. Sainsbury's needs to cut costs, partly so it can invest in lowering its prices to keep up with the intense competition. Customers will vote with their feet if they've got it wrong.

"England's four-week lockdown will make a 'real impact', the prime minister says at a news briefing The chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, says the second wave 'is real and it's serious' The new four-week lockdown in England means non-essential shops, pubs and gyms are closed The furlough scheme is to be extended until the end of March with the government paying up to 80% of wages The chancellor also says any part of the UK will be able to access the scheme if it needs to lock down in that time The Bank of England is to pump an extra Â£150bn into the economy while UK interest rates are held at 0.1% The US recorded more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday â a record one-day increase Edited by Chris Clayton Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, that's all from us today. We'll be back in the morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. It's been another busy day, here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There was lots of talk in the press conference about the importance
of testing and tracing. Billions of pounds have been spent on developing the
testing system and employing contact tracers. But real concern among councils
about the lack of support provided to people who are asked to self-isolate. Only those on very low incomes are entitled to Â£500 support payments. It means
people from all walks of life from self-employed to contractors and people on
zero-hours contracts are financially penalised if they play by the rules. Thatâs why, many say, so few self-isolate fully â fewer than one in five,
according to some estimates. Reality Check NHS England chief Simon Stevens said
that âright now we've got around 30,000 NHS staff who are either off with
coronavirus or having to self-isolate"". Itâs a big number, but itâs
important to remember that with a workforce headcount of over 1.3m people, this
is just 2% of all staff. But combined with other illnesses
or absences, we know that an outbreak similar to that in the spring can have a
big impact on the workforce. In April, the sickness and absence
rate hit 6.2%. This means that if we looked at every day the workforce are
expected to work, just over one in 20 was lost. Just a third of these were due to
coronavirus. A further 20% were due to
mental health problems â including stress or anxiety. Other high reasons for
absences, unrelated to coronavirus, include muscle or bone pain and infections
such as the flu. Travellers returning to the UK from Germany and Sweden from 04:00 GMT on Saturday must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has announced. The two countries are the latest to be removed from the travel corridor list for the whole of the UK. While holidays are currently banned for people living in
England and Wales, work trips are still permitted. Sowhat
are the current quarantine rulesfor travellers? Closing the press conference, Boris Johnson says that ""alas"", he is once again going to have to ask people to ""stay at home"" in an effort to control the virus. But he adds that the country is in a ""far, far better position"" to weather the impact of the second wave of the virus, compared with during the first lockdown. In the final question, a reporter asks about the backlog in non-Covid related testing in hospitals - with more than 1.2m people waiting for tests. Asked if he will provide the funding to bring in the staff and kit to carry out the tests, Johnson says there has ""never been greater investment in the NHS than under this government"". And he says it will continue with more staff recruitment. Sir Simon agrees that there needs to be an expansion in capacity for testing other health issues, and talks of moving scanners onto the high street. But he says waiting lists have not reached the 10 million warning from the summer. He adds: ""One small silver lining of the commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff [during Covid] is they have inspired a new generation of young people to become nurses, doctors and therapists of the future."" Reality Check The prime minister said that the
UK had built the âlargest testing capacity in Europeâ and that âover half a million
tests are available each day"". Earlier this week, the government
said it reached its target to increase testing capacity to 500,00 tests a day -
at the moment it says that labs across the UK are able to process 526,000
swab tests a day. But this doesnât mean they are
actually doing that many tests. In fact, on Tuesday, just over
half that many tests were actually carried out â about 265,000. The government says this gap between capacity and actual tests carried out is deliberate so that they can
deal effectively with surges in demand. Their website says that they should be
processing at a maximum of 85% of capacity. Sir Simon Stevens is asked how confident he is the lockdown will relieve pressures on the NHS quickly enough to allow the measures to lift. In reply, he says they are ""hoping and expecting"" not to see the ""large"" increase in admissions that had been predicted by scientists if no lockdown were imposed. The prime minister is asked whether the government will hand control of the struggling test-and-trace system over to local authorities - currently is is being run by private firms. Boris Johnson admits the tracing scheme ""hasn't had as much impact as we would have wanted"" - but insists it has had some effect in slowing the spread of the virus. He says it ""has taken too long"" for people to get test results - but this is improving, he says. He says mass testing is a ""really promising"" development that could remove the need for people to self-isolate. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Shunning projections that have
proved so controversial, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has
tried to play it straight. He presents a chart showing how
the numbers in hospital have gone up since the summer with more than 11,000 in
hospital in England. He then provides some important context â comparing that with the numbers in hospital with flu â about 3,000 in the depths of winter â or getting treatment for cancer, normally 7,000. The context is important â and shows the burden Covid is placing on the health service. But two things that were not shown were the numbers in hospital at the peak in the spring â 17,000 â or the number of free beds, thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We donât know the latter because NHS bosses are not publishing them. An important point on the day that the UK Statistics Authority calls for greater transparencyover the way Covid data is presented. Next up, a reporter asks about a letter from the UK Statistics Authority which questioned the data presented to the public, saying it had the potential to confuse people. The PM says the government is ""trying to make things as clear as we possibly can"". He admits that projections ""vary widely"" and scientists can disagree, so it is up to government to make ""political judgements"". Johnson says it is ""very, very tough to make exactly the right call"" but some of the data, such as the number of deaths, was ""irrefutable"". He adds: ""I can't quarrel with those data and we have to act on those data."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Christmas is becoming a big
theme in the coronavirus press conferences. Boris Johnson has just struck an
optimistic tone â saying if people follow the rules, as normal a Christmas as
possible will be on the cards. The four governments of the UK have also agreed
to work together on a common strategy. But some are more pessimistic â and
believe big family gatherings are unlikely this year. Asked whether restrictions will have to continue over the New Year, Sir Simon Stevens says this will depend on whether the infection rate comes down over the next month. The NHS England chief executive says the success of controlling the disease will be a ""force multiplier"" in helping the NHS provide ordinary care. The PM is also asked whether he would be able to extend restrictions given opposition to them from the Conservative backbenchers. The PM repeats that the new lockdown law will expire automatically. After this, he says he wants to offer people ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". The next question is about whether we will be able to celebrate Christmas normally. The PM says: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustrated by the measures... but I also know the overwhelming majority of people will work together to get the R down."" He says it can be done by 2 December, adding: ""I have every confidence we will be able to [get infections down] if we follow this package of measures. ""I [have] no doubt people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and things can open before Christmas as well."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The government has been asked
today why it didnât extend furlough earlier. For months, opposition parties and
devolved governments have said the scheme should have lasted into winter. The PM is defending the strategy
earlier in the summer to try and wind it down â and ultimately replace it. He
is blaming the âautumn surgeâ for the need to rethink. The first question from a member of the press comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks why the furlough scheme was not extended earlier. Johnson says the scheme has run continuously since the ""onset"" of the crisis and the announcement today will give firms greater certainty. Asked whether the government should have been more cautious in lifting lockdown over the summer, Sir Simon Stevens says the reduction over the summer was ""substantial"". ""When the facts change, you've got to change in accordance with those new facts,"" he says. He adds that the spread of the virus has increased across Europe. In the second question from the public, the PM is asked what consideration has been given to limited vaccine success and how we live with Covid going forward if they don't work. Johnson says there is a ""tripod we are resting our programme on the way ahead"", starting with therapeutics and medicines, moving to the testing regime, and then the vaccines. ""That's the way forward, but if you talk to the scientists they believe things will start naturally to improve in the spring for other reasons"", such as the improvement in weather conditions. The PM adds: ""I think the real progress we are going to see is with science. ""There isn't a virus that has threatened humanity that we haven't beaten."" Sir Simon says there are six ""front runner"" vaccines and the ones coming first are the ""cleverest"", so he remains positive. The first question at todayâs press conference comes from Tom, a member of the public, who asks about the ban on amateur football in England's lockdown. Boris Johnson says he would ""love to be able"" to let this continue, but the ""package of measures"" must be ""complete"" to get the infection rate down. He says this is a ""sad answer"" to have to give. Sir Simon says preparation has been ""substantial"". There is four months of PPE ready and waiting, and staff have been working ""hammer and tongs to catch up on disruption for first wave"". But the message from staff is ""we do need your help"" to ""help us help you"". He concludes by quoting an ICU nurse, who says while we cannot stop heart attacks and strokes, ""we can reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and that is what we need to do to care for everybody who needs it"". Reality Check The prime minister has been
talking about the furlough scheme - which had been extended from the start of
November to 2 December - and has now been extended to the end of March. The scheme will pay up to 80% of a
personâs wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. According to the latest figures up
to 18 October,a total of 9.6 million people had been furloughed at a cost of Â£41.4bn.,external The cost of the scheme per
employee has been falling in recent months, with employers having to pay 0% of
the wage in September and 20% in October. But the government has confirmed
it will be paying the full 80% in November. It will also allow anybody who was
made redundant after 23 September in anticipation of the end of the scheme to
be rehired and put back on furlough. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9996966

"England's four-week lockdown will make a 'real impact', the prime minister says at a news briefing The chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, says the second wave 'is real and it's serious' The new four-week lockdown in England means non-essential shops, pubs and gyms are closed The furlough scheme is to be extended until the end of March with the government paying up to 80% of wages The chancellor also says any part of the UK will be able to access the scheme if it needs to lock down in that time The Bank of England is to pump an extra Â£150bn into the economy while UK interest rates are held at 0.1% The US recorded more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday â a record one-day increase Edited by Chris Clayton Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, that's all from us today. We'll be back in the morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. It's been another busy day, here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There was lots of talk in the press conference about the importance
of testing and tracing. Billions of pounds have been spent on developing the
testing system and employing contact tracers. But real concern among councils
about the lack of support provided to people who are asked to self-isolate. Only those on very low incomes are entitled to Â£500 support payments. It means
people from all walks of life from self-employed to contractors and people on
zero-hours contracts are financially penalised if they play by the rules. Thatâs why, many say, so few self-isolate fully â fewer than one in five,
according to some estimates. Reality Check NHS England chief Simon Stevens said
that âright now we've got around 30,000 NHS staff who are either off with
coronavirus or having to self-isolate"". Itâs a big number, but itâs
important to remember that with a workforce headcount of over 1.3m people, this
is just 2% of all staff. But combined with other illnesses
or absences, we know that an outbreak similar to that in the spring can have a
big impact on the workforce. In April, the sickness and absence
rate hit 6.2%. This means that if we looked at every day the workforce are
expected to work, just over one in 20 was lost. Just a third of these were due to
coronavirus. A further 20% were due to
mental health problems â including stress or anxiety. Other high reasons for
absences, unrelated to coronavirus, include muscle or bone pain and infections
such as the flu. Travellers returning to the UK from Germany and Sweden from 04:00 GMT on Saturday must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has announced. The two countries are the latest to be removed from the travel corridor list for the whole of the UK. While holidays are currently banned for people living in
England and Wales, work trips are still permitted. Sowhat
are the current quarantine rulesfor travellers? Closing the press conference, Boris Johnson says that ""alas"", he is once again going to have to ask people to ""stay at home"" in an effort to control the virus. But he adds that the country is in a ""far, far better position"" to weather the impact of the second wave of the virus, compared with during the first lockdown. In the final question, a reporter asks about the backlog in non-Covid related testing in hospitals - with more than 1.2m people waiting for tests. Asked if he will provide the funding to bring in the staff and kit to carry out the tests, Johnson says there has ""never been greater investment in the NHS than under this government"". And he says it will continue with more staff recruitment. Sir Simon agrees that there needs to be an expansion in capacity for testing other health issues, and talks of moving scanners onto the high street. But he says waiting lists have not reached the 10 million warning from the summer. He adds: ""One small silver lining of the commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff [during Covid] is they have inspired a new generation of young people to become nurses, doctors and therapists of the future."" Reality Check The prime minister said that the
UK had built the âlargest testing capacity in Europeâ and that âover half a million
tests are available each day"". Earlier this week, the government
said it reached its target to increase testing capacity to 500,00 tests a day -
at the moment it says that labs across the UK are able to process 526,000
swab tests a day. But this doesnât mean they are
actually doing that many tests. In fact, on Tuesday, just over
half that many tests were actually carried out â about 265,000. The government says this gap between capacity and actual tests carried out is deliberate so that they can
deal effectively with surges in demand. Their website says that they should be
processing at a maximum of 85% of capacity. Sir Simon Stevens is asked how confident he is the lockdown will relieve pressures on the NHS quickly enough to allow the measures to lift. In reply, he says they are ""hoping and expecting"" not to see the ""large"" increase in admissions that had been predicted by scientists if no lockdown were imposed. The prime minister is asked whether the government will hand control of the struggling test-and-trace system over to local authorities - currently is is being run by private firms. Boris Johnson admits the tracing scheme ""hasn't had as much impact as we would have wanted"" - but insists it has had some effect in slowing the spread of the virus. He says it ""has taken too long"" for people to get test results - but this is improving, he says. He says mass testing is a ""really promising"" development that could remove the need for people to self-isolate. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Shunning projections that have
proved so controversial, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has
tried to play it straight. He presents a chart showing how
the numbers in hospital have gone up since the summer with more than 11,000 in
hospital in England. He then provides some important context â comparing that with the numbers in hospital with flu â about 3,000 in the depths of winter â or getting treatment for cancer, normally 7,000. The context is important â and shows the burden Covid is placing on the health service. But two things that were not shown were the numbers in hospital at the peak in the spring â 17,000 â or the number of free beds, thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We donât know the latter because NHS bosses are not publishing them. An important point on the day that the UK Statistics Authority calls for greater transparencyover the way Covid data is presented. Next up, a reporter asks about a letter from the UK Statistics Authority which questioned the data presented to the public, saying it had the potential to confuse people. The PM says the government is ""trying to make things as clear as we possibly can"". He admits that projections ""vary widely"" and scientists can disagree, so it is up to government to make ""political judgements"". Johnson says it is ""very, very tough to make exactly the right call"" but some of the data, such as the number of deaths, was ""irrefutable"". He adds: ""I can't quarrel with those data and we have to act on those data."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Christmas is becoming a big
theme in the coronavirus press conferences. Boris Johnson has just struck an
optimistic tone â saying if people follow the rules, as normal a Christmas as
possible will be on the cards. The four governments of the UK have also agreed
to work together on a common strategy. But some are more pessimistic â and
believe big family gatherings are unlikely this year. Asked whether restrictions will have to continue over the New Year, Sir Simon Stevens says this will depend on whether the infection rate comes down over the next month. The NHS England chief executive says the success of controlling the disease will be a ""force multiplier"" in helping the NHS provide ordinary care. The PM is also asked whether he would be able to extend restrictions given opposition to them from the Conservative backbenchers. The PM repeats that the new lockdown law will expire automatically. After this, he says he wants to offer people ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". The next question is about whether we will be able to celebrate Christmas normally. The PM says: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustrated by the measures... but I also know the overwhelming majority of people will work together to get the R down."" He says it can be done by 2 December, adding: ""I have every confidence we will be able to [get infections down] if we follow this package of measures. ""I [have] no doubt people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and things can open before Christmas as well."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The government has been asked
today why it didnât extend furlough earlier. For months, opposition parties and
devolved governments have said the scheme should have lasted into winter. The PM is defending the strategy
earlier in the summer to try and wind it down â and ultimately replace it. He
is blaming the âautumn surgeâ for the need to rethink. The first question from a member of the press comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks why the furlough scheme was not extended earlier. Johnson says the scheme has run continuously since the ""onset"" of the crisis and the announcement today will give firms greater certainty. Asked whether the government should have been more cautious in lifting lockdown over the summer, Sir Simon Stevens says the reduction over the summer was ""substantial"". ""When the facts change, you've got to change in accordance with those new facts,"" he says. He adds that the spread of the virus has increased across Europe. In the second question from the public, the PM is asked what consideration has been given to limited vaccine success and how we live with Covid going forward if they don't work. Johnson says there is a ""tripod we are resting our programme on the way ahead"", starting with therapeutics and medicines, moving to the testing regime, and then the vaccines. ""That's the way forward, but if you talk to the scientists they believe things will start naturally to improve in the spring for other reasons"", such as the improvement in weather conditions. The PM adds: ""I think the real progress we are going to see is with science. ""There isn't a virus that has threatened humanity that we haven't beaten."" Sir Simon says there are six ""front runner"" vaccines and the ones coming first are the ""cleverest"", so he remains positive. The first question at todayâs press conference comes from Tom, a member of the public, who asks about the ban on amateur football in England's lockdown. Boris Johnson says he would ""love to be able"" to let this continue, but the ""package of measures"" must be ""complete"" to get the infection rate down. He says this is a ""sad answer"" to have to give. Sir Simon says preparation has been ""substantial"". There is four months of PPE ready and waiting, and staff have been working ""hammer and tongs to catch up on disruption for first wave"". But the message from staff is ""we do need your help"" to ""help us help you"". He concludes by quoting an ICU nurse, who says while we cannot stop heart attacks and strokes, ""we can reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and that is what we need to do to care for everybody who needs it"".

"Newcastle manager Steve Bruce and owner Mike Ashley have spoken out about the pay-per-view fixtures The Premier League is likely to scrap the controversial pay-per-view method for matches after November's international window. Clubs will instead look to devise a new solution that will cover the Christmas period. A definitive decision was not taken at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday but discussions are said to be ongoing. However, the Â£14.95 fee - which led to significant protests among fan groups - is expected to be dropped. It is understood the model used in September, when all games were shown live by the Premier League's broadcast partners, is the likely direction of travel. Pay-per-view remains on the table but a final decision is not expected this week. In a statement, the Premier League said shareholders met on Thursday ""to discuss a number of important issues"", including the broadcast options for matches following the international break. ""Discussions with all stakeholders are ongoing and a broadcast solution will be announced in due course,"" it added. More than Â£300,000 has been raised for charity by fans boycotting pay-per-view games, whichwere introduced in Octoberafter clubs voted 19-1 in favour of the ""interim solution"". Liverpool's fan group the Spirit of Shankly described the decision to charge Â£14.95 as ""disgraceful"", while the Football Supporters' Association said many fans were ""concerned"" over the price and wanted it reduced. Following Thursday's meeting, an FSA spokesperson said: ""Supporters made clear their revulsion at the Â£15 cost to see their teams on Sky and BT Sport's pay-per-view platforms last month, an emotion running so deep that fan protests across the country even reached the ears of untouchable Premier League club owners. ""We await to see the detail of what the Premier League and its broadcasters will now offer supporters who remain locked out of grounds for the foreseeable future - they simply must come up with a solution that is affordable for all."" Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and manager Steve Bruce havesaid the fee for one-off matches is too high,while former Manchester United and England right-back Gary Neville, now a Sky pundit, said the system ""just needs scrapping"". Pay-per-view will still be used for this weekend's fixtures, for games not selected for regular television broadcast, and whatever decision is made would come into force from 21 November and is due to last for the rest of the year. Last month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said the Â£14.95 fee was ""defensible"", and the announcement of the model came at a time when top-flight clubs were lobbying for spectators to be allowed back into grounds. However, England has since entered a second national lockdown, which will last until 2 December, and hopes of an imminent return of fans have faded. In September, all 28 Premier League matches were shown live, with all broadcast partners - Sky Sports, BT Sport, the BBC and Amazon Prime - screening matches. Meanwhile, the Premier League said its shareholders also reiterated that a rescue package remains on the table for EFL clubs suffering financially during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The offer guarantees no EFL club need go out of business as a result of the pandemic in the 2020-21 season, and our intention is to play an active role in helping clubs return to financial stability,"" it said in a statement. ""The Premier League will engage directly with any EFL club that is suffering severe financial losses due to the pandemic, and will remain in dialogue with the EFL on this important issue. ""The rescue package is on top of solidarity payments totalling Â£110m already advanced to the EFL this season, alongside additional financial support for youth development and community programmes.""

"A worker shuts the doors in a bar in Bristol city centre, ahead of the lockdown beginning People who seriously flout new lockdown restrictions in England will face steep fines, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has warned. Underthe rules,external, people have been told to stay at home and non-essential shops, pubs and gyms ordered to close. Households are also banned from mixing indoors or in private gardens, unless in a support bubble. Currently there is a Â£200 fine for each breach which doubles on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. And organisers of large gatherings face a Â£10,000 fine. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT, alongside NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. It comes as the chancellorextended the furlough scheme across the UK until the end of March- paying up to 80% of an employee's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. What can you do during England's new lockdown? The last thing I bought before lockdown 2.0 Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Buckland said law enforcement would continue its approach of ""policing by consent"" to encourage the public to comply with the four-week lockdown. But he added that police would respond to ""egregious breaches"" and then the law would ""take its course"". He said: ""Where a more intense intervention is needed then the police will be involved and of course the fine structure is still in force."" This video can not be played From getting your bike repaired to going to the vet, Laura Foster explains the things you're allowed to do this lockdown The National Police Chiefs Council has also warned the most serious offenders will face fines. Mr Buckland said he supported the police clamping down on the ""tiny minority"" of people who are not willing to obey the lockdown. ""I think the message has to go out very clearly that this will only work if we all play our part,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. There will also be an expansion of the number ofCovid marshals, who help ensure social distancing rules are followed in local communities, according to Mr Buckland. What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Am I eligible for the extended furlough scheme? Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs the extension of the furlough scheme, which the government will review in January, would ""give people and businesses up and down our country immense comfort over what will be a difficult winter"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood she had not seen the detail of the announcement, but she would ""unreservedly welcome"" an extension of furlough on 80% terms. Her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford tweeted that the announcement gave businesses and workers ""some certainty"". Elsewhere, the governor of the Bank of England hasvowed to do ""everything we can""to support the economy, announcing a further Â£150bn of support. It has left interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.1%. On Wednesday,MPs backed the lockdown, which aims to combat a surge in coronavirus cases and replaces the three tiers of regional restrictions that were previously in place across England. Mr Johnson has said the lockdown will ""expire automatically"" on 2 December, and there is expected to be another vote on the next steps needed to tackle the virus before it ends. It came as the UK recorded a further 492 coronavirus deaths - the highest daily figure since 19 May - and 25,177 confirmed cases. Under the new restrictions, people should stay at home except for specific reasons including education and work, if it cannot be done from home. All non-essential retailers, leisure and entertainment venues must shut, with pubs and restaurants told to close except for takeaways. Downing Street said there was ""no change"" to a ban on religious services, after Cardinal Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, said there was no scientific evidence for the decision. The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was continuing to work with faith leaders and added places of worship were open for private prayer.

"Dominic Chappell was not of ""positive good character"", prosecutors said Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion. A Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of failing to pay tax of around Â£584,000 on Â£2.2m of income he received after buying the failed chain for Â£1. The court heard the 53-year-old spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday to the Bahamas. Chappell's lawyers claimed he became ""utterly broke"" after BHS's ""pension problem exploded"" in 2015. Mr Chappell controversially bought the retailer from tycoon Sir Philip Green that year, but the chain collapsed soon after in 2016. It led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Five issues at the heart of the BHS story 'I was in charge of millions, then I had nothing' In sentencing, the judge said Chappell had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"". ""You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies,"" he said. Simon York, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: ""This was deliberate theft from UK citizens. Chappell was a high-profile businessman who knew tax had to be paid on his income and profits but chose not to do so. ""That's money that should have been supporting our vital public services instead of funding his lavish lifestyle."" BHS fell into administration in 2016 BHS, once one of Britain's best known retailers, was losing Â£1m a week and had a huge pension deficit when Chappell's consortium, Retail Acquisitions, bought it in 2015. In his year of ownership Mr Chappell received Â£2.5m in payments from BHS , largely for consultancy fees provided by another of his companies, the bankrupt finance firm Swiss Rock Limited. Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised for agreeing to the deal, andlater agreed a Â£363m cash settlementwith the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme. However, on Thursday prosecutors condemned Chappell for spending large sums of money at a time when he should have been trying to save BHS. ""Chappell purchased the struggling retail chain for just Â£1 and was paid thousands of pounds in his new role, where he was tasked with avoiding more redundancies,"" said crown prosecutor Andrew Fox. ""Instead, while the company fell further into financial difficulty, he spent his new income lavishly on luxury breaks abroad and expensive yachts."" The court heard Chappell, a former racing driver, also bought Â£11,000 worth of items from a gun and outdoor wear shop, including expensive Beretta firearms. Prosecutors said HMRC repeatedly tried to chase down the missing funds, but Chappell ignored their requests, at one point going on a skiing break before asking for more time to pay the money when he returned home. In his defence, Chappell argued he was too busy resolving issues with BHS to deal with the outstanding taxes that were due. He had denied three charges of tax fraud. Earlier this year Chappell wasordered to pay Â£9.5m into BHS pension schemesafter losing an appeal. And in 2019 the Government's Insolvency Service banned him from running a company for 10 years, saying he had carried out ""reckless financial transactions"" and ""failed to maintain adequate company records"".

"England's four-week lockdown will make a 'real impact', the prime minister says at a news briefing The chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, says the second wave 'is real and it's serious' The new four-week lockdown in England means non-essential shops, pubs and gyms are closed The furlough scheme is to be extended until the end of March with the government paying up to 80% of wages The chancellor also says any part of the UK will be able to access the scheme if it needs to lock down in that time The Bank of England is to pump an extra Â£150bn into the economy while UK interest rates are held at 0.1% The US recorded more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday â a record one-day increase Edited by Chris Clayton Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, that's all from us today. We'll be back in the morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. It's been another busy day, here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There was lots of talk in the press conference about the importance
of testing and tracing. Billions of pounds have been spent on developing the
testing system and employing contact tracers. But real concern among councils
about the lack of support provided to people who are asked to self-isolate. Only those on very low incomes are entitled to Â£500 support payments. It means
people from all walks of life from self-employed to contractors and people on
zero-hours contracts are financially penalised if they play by the rules. Thatâs why, many say, so few self-isolate fully â fewer than one in five,
according to some estimates. Reality Check NHS England chief Simon Stevens said
that âright now we've got around 30,000 NHS staff who are either off with
coronavirus or having to self-isolate"". Itâs a big number, but itâs
important to remember that with a workforce headcount of over 1.3m people, this
is just 2% of all staff. But combined with other illnesses
or absences, we know that an outbreak similar to that in the spring can have a
big impact on the workforce. In April, the sickness and absence
rate hit 6.2%. This means that if we looked at every day the workforce are
expected to work, just over one in 20 was lost. Just a third of these were due to
coronavirus. A further 20% were due to
mental health problems â including stress or anxiety. Other high reasons for
absences, unrelated to coronavirus, include muscle or bone pain and infections
such as the flu. Travellers returning to the UK from Germany and Sweden from 04:00 GMT on Saturday must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has announced. The two countries are the latest to be removed from the travel corridor list for the whole of the UK. While holidays are currently banned for people living in
England and Wales, work trips are still permitted. Sowhat
are the current quarantine rulesfor travellers? Closing the press conference, Boris Johnson says that ""alas"", he is once again going to have to ask people to ""stay at home"" in an effort to control the virus. But he adds that the country is in a ""far, far better position"" to weather the impact of the second wave of the virus, compared with during the first lockdown. In the final question, a reporter asks about the backlog in non-Covid related testing in hospitals - with more than 1.2m people waiting for tests. Asked if he will provide the funding to bring in the staff and kit to carry out the tests, Johnson says there has ""never been greater investment in the NHS than under this government"". And he says it will continue with more staff recruitment. Sir Simon agrees that there needs to be an expansion in capacity for testing other health issues, and talks of moving scanners onto the high street. But he says waiting lists have not reached the 10 million warning from the summer. He adds: ""One small silver lining of the commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff [during Covid] is they have inspired a new generation of young people to become nurses, doctors and therapists of the future."" Reality Check The prime minister said that the
UK had built the âlargest testing capacity in Europeâ and that âover half a million
tests are available each day"". Earlier this week, the government
said it reached its target to increase testing capacity to 500,00 tests a day -
at the moment it says that labs across the UK are able to process 526,000
swab tests a day. But this doesnât mean they are
actually doing that many tests. In fact, on Tuesday, just over
half that many tests were actually carried out â about 265,000. The government says this gap between capacity and actual tests carried out is deliberate so that they can
deal effectively with surges in demand. Their website says that they should be
processing at a maximum of 85% of capacity. Sir Simon Stevens is asked how confident he is the lockdown will relieve pressures on the NHS quickly enough to allow the measures to lift. In reply, he says they are ""hoping and expecting"" not to see the ""large"" increase in admissions that had been predicted by scientists if no lockdown were imposed. The prime minister is asked whether the government will hand control of the struggling test-and-trace system over to local authorities - currently is is being run by private firms. Boris Johnson admits the tracing scheme ""hasn't had as much impact as we would have wanted"" - but insists it has had some effect in slowing the spread of the virus. He says it ""has taken too long"" for people to get test results - but this is improving, he says. He says mass testing is a ""really promising"" development that could remove the need for people to self-isolate. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Shunning projections that have
proved so controversial, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has
tried to play it straight. He presents a chart showing how
the numbers in hospital have gone up since the summer with more than 11,000 in
hospital in England. He then provides some important context â comparing that with the numbers in hospital with flu â about 3,000 in the depths of winter â or getting treatment for cancer, normally 7,000. The context is important â and shows the burden Covid is placing on the health service. But two things that were not shown were the numbers in hospital at the peak in the spring â 17,000 â or the number of free beds, thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We donât know the latter because NHS bosses are not publishing them. An important point on the day that the UK Statistics Authority calls for greater transparencyover the way Covid data is presented. Next up, a reporter asks about a letter from the UK Statistics Authority which questioned the data presented to the public, saying it had the potential to confuse people. The PM says the government is ""trying to make things as clear as we possibly can"". He admits that projections ""vary widely"" and scientists can disagree, so it is up to government to make ""political judgements"". Johnson says it is ""very, very tough to make exactly the right call"" but some of the data, such as the number of deaths, was ""irrefutable"". He adds: ""I can't quarrel with those data and we have to act on those data."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Christmas is becoming a big
theme in the coronavirus press conferences. Boris Johnson has just struck an
optimistic tone â saying if people follow the rules, as normal a Christmas as
possible will be on the cards. The four governments of the UK have also agreed
to work together on a common strategy. But some are more pessimistic â and
believe big family gatherings are unlikely this year. Asked whether restrictions will have to continue over the New Year, Sir Simon Stevens says this will depend on whether the infection rate comes down over the next month. The NHS England chief executive says the success of controlling the disease will be a ""force multiplier"" in helping the NHS provide ordinary care. The PM is also asked whether he would be able to extend restrictions given opposition to them from the Conservative backbenchers. The PM repeats that the new lockdown law will expire automatically. After this, he says he wants to offer people ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". The next question is about whether we will be able to celebrate Christmas normally. The PM says: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustrated by the measures... but I also know the overwhelming majority of people will work together to get the R down."" He says it can be done by 2 December, adding: ""I have every confidence we will be able to [get infections down] if we follow this package of measures. ""I [have] no doubt people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and things can open before Christmas as well."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The government has been asked
today why it didnât extend furlough earlier. For months, opposition parties and
devolved governments have said the scheme should have lasted into winter. The PM is defending the strategy
earlier in the summer to try and wind it down â and ultimately replace it. He
is blaming the âautumn surgeâ for the need to rethink. The first question from a member of the press comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks why the furlough scheme was not extended earlier. Johnson says the scheme has run continuously since the ""onset"" of the crisis and the announcement today will give firms greater certainty. Asked whether the government should have been more cautious in lifting lockdown over the summer, Sir Simon Stevens says the reduction over the summer was ""substantial"". ""When the facts change, you've got to change in accordance with those new facts,"" he says. He adds that the spread of the virus has increased across Europe. In the second question from the public, the PM is asked what consideration has been given to limited vaccine success and how we live with Covid going forward if they don't work. Johnson says there is a ""tripod we are resting our programme on the way ahead"", starting with therapeutics and medicines, moving to the testing regime, and then the vaccines. ""That's the way forward, but if you talk to the scientists they believe things will start naturally to improve in the spring for other reasons"", such as the improvement in weather conditions. The PM adds: ""I think the real progress we are going to see is with science. ""There isn't a virus that has threatened humanity that we haven't beaten."" Sir Simon says there are six ""front runner"" vaccines and the ones coming first are the ""cleverest"", so he remains positive. The first question at todayâs press conference comes from Tom, a member of the public, who asks about the ban on amateur football in England's lockdown. Boris Johnson says he would ""love to be able"" to let this continue, but the ""package of measures"" must be ""complete"" to get the infection rate down. He says this is a ""sad answer"" to have to give. Sir Simon says preparation has been ""substantial"". There is four months of PPE ready and waiting, and staff have been working ""hammer and tongs to catch up on disruption for first wave"". But the message from staff is ""we do need your help"" to ""help us help you"". He concludes by quoting an ICU nurse, who says while we cannot stop heart attacks and strokes, ""we can reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and that is what we need to do to care for everybody who needs it"". Reality Check The prime minister has been
talking about the furlough scheme - which had been extended from the start of
November to 2 December - and has now been extended to the end of March. The scheme will pay up to 80% of a
personâs wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. According to the latest figures up
to 18 October,a total of 9.6 million people had been furloughed at a cost of Â£41.4bn.,external The cost of the scheme per
employee has been falling in recent months, with employers having to pay 0% of
the wage in September and 20% in October. But the government has confirmed
it will be paying the full 80% in November. It will also allow anybody who was
made redundant after 23 September in anticipation of the end of the scheme to
be rehired and put back on furlough. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0007856199
"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme to March The furlough scheme will be extended across the UK until the end of March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed. Mr Sunak said the scheme will pay up to 80% of a person's wage up to Â£2,500 a month. He told the Commons that the government will review the policy in January. The chancellor said his intention was ""to give businesses security through the winter"". ""The security we are providing will protect millions of jobs,"" he added. The furlough scheme, or Job Retention Scheme, subsidises the wages of people who cannot do their jobs, either because their workplace is closed or because there is no longer enough work for them. Mr Sunak said it would apply throughout the UK, saying the country had ""a Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Coronavirus: Am I eligible for the extended furlough scheme? Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting? As part of the revised scheme, anyone made redundant after 23 September can be rehired and put back on furlough. The Job Support Scheme - a less generous form of support that had originally been set to replace the furlough scheme in November - has now been postponed. Mr Sunak also announced billions of pounds of other support for the economy, including more money for self-employed people. Support through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will be increased, with the third grant covering November to January calculated at 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of Â£7,500. At the same time, the chancellor raised guaranteed funding for the UK's devolved administrations by Â£2bn to Â£16bn. But, many people will remain ineligible for help, including the newly self-employed, those whose pay themselves in dividends, freelancers, and sole traders who previously had a trading profit of more than Â£50,000. Chef Louise Solomon, 49, is going back on furlough from midnight and says she feels ""a huge sense of relief"". She says without the support, she and her wife, a key worker, would only have lasted a few months before things got tight. ""I have card loans, and companies want to be paid regardless. I'd probably have to sell my car and look at what else I could get rid of."" Instead, the furlough extension has given her some breathing space. ""It gives you that security - you can sleep at night, knowing money is coming in."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of ignoring objections to the government's measures ""until the last possible moment"". She pointed out that he had previously ""ridiculed"" a furlough extension as ""a blunt instrument"". But Mr Sunak defended his rapid change of policy, saying: ""It is not a weakness to be fast-moving in a crisis, but rather a strength."" Alison Thewliss, the Scottish National Party's Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, described the ""long-overdue Tory U-turn"" as ""welcome"", but said it came after six months of sustained pressure from the SNP and devolved governments. Northern Ireland Finance Minister Conor Murphy welcomed the new support, but said it was ""regrettable"" that repeated calls to extend the furlough scheme ""had not been answered sooner"". This is a change of heart from ministers - and a really significant one. The chancellor and the prime minister did not want to be here. The furlough scheme was due to end at the start of November. At the weekend, we found out it would last until 2 December. Now it's staying until the end of March. The government will argue it is necessary because of a changing health picture. They are clearly worried about the economic outlook. But political opponents have been calling for this for some time and they believe the chancellor has waited too long. The Treasury has said anyone who was made redundant after 23 September - when the furlough replacement was announced - can be brought back on to the scheme. But the government will face accusations it should have done this sooner. The latest announcement follows several days of wrangling over the scope and duration of the furlough scheme. It was due to end on 31 October, but was then extended to cover the new four-week lockdown in England. That announcement at the weekend sparked a row with Scotland and Wales, which argued that it was unfair for the full support package to be available only when England is in lockdown. They said the scheme should be on offer if they went into their own full national lockdowns later on. England entered a second lockdown on Thursday until 2 December The Treasury has not put a cost on extending the furlough initiative until March, as it will depend on the take-up of the scheme, However, it suggests a rule of thumb of Â£1bn a month, per million who use it. So three million furloughed workers would cost Â£3bn a month. The furlough scheme has cost more than Â£50bn so far. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support did not go far enough, particularly for the self-employed, and suggested it had been ""dreamt up on the hoof"".

However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said extending the furlough scheme and the self-employment grant to the end of March provided ""important support to the UK economy at a time of heightened uncertainty"". Heathrow airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: ""Whilst we welcome the extension of the furlough scheme, we are clear that it doesn't go far enough for an aviation sector that has been on its knees since March."" He said the sector was being ignored by the government, adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of families across the UK that rely on jobs in aviation to pay the bills have no other choice than to feel very alone."" Mr Sunak's statement comes after theBank of England said it was pumping an extra Â£150bn into the economy. The Bank warned the resurgence of Covid-19 would lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Just as the last furlough scheme extended long beyond the date that some businesses were allowed to reopen, so we should not infer that furlough till March means lockdown in England till March. The current measures for England will be lifted on 2 December, but are likely to be replaced by a form of the regional tier system in place until now. One of the interesting things to watch in the coming weeks will be the effect of lockdown measures on the infection rates. The hard-hit hospitality industry, in particular, has argued vehemently that the evidence that pubs, bars and restaurants are a major spreader of infection is very thin. Does shutting hospitality make a huge difference to the spread of infection? The industry says we are about to find out. The furlough scheme was introduced in March and was originally intended to end in May, but Mr Sunak said at the outset that it would be extended ""if necessary"". About 9.6 million people have benefited at one time or another, with a steep take-up in the first few months. However, some have questioned whether all the money has been wisely spent. HM Revenue and Customs, which administers the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August - some Â£3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. It is also unclear whether it has genuinely safeguarded viable jobs or merely delayed the inevitable disappearance of unviable ones. What is your experience of the furlough scheme?

"England's four-week lockdown will make a 'real impact', the prime minister says at a news briefing The chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, says the second wave 'is real and it's serious' The new four-week lockdown in England means non-essential shops, pubs and gyms are closed The furlough scheme is to be extended until the end of March with the government paying up to 80% of wages The chancellor also says any part of the UK will be able to access the scheme if it needs to lock down in that time The Bank of England is to pump an extra Â£150bn into the economy while UK interest rates are held at 0.1% The US recorded more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday â a record one-day increase Edited by Chris Clayton Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, that's all from us today. We'll be back in the morning with more updates from the UK and around the world. It's been another busy day, here's a recap of the day's main headlines: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There was lots of talk in the press conference about the importance
of testing and tracing. Billions of pounds have been spent on developing the
testing system and employing contact tracers. But real concern among councils
about the lack of support provided to people who are asked to self-isolate. Only those on very low incomes are entitled to Â£500 support payments. It means
people from all walks of life from self-employed to contractors and people on
zero-hours contracts are financially penalised if they play by the rules. Thatâs why, many say, so few self-isolate fully â fewer than one in five,
according to some estimates. Reality Check NHS England chief Simon Stevens said
that âright now we've got around 30,000 NHS staff who are either off with
coronavirus or having to self-isolate"". Itâs a big number, but itâs
important to remember that with a workforce headcount of over 1.3m people, this
is just 2% of all staff. But combined with other illnesses
or absences, we know that an outbreak similar to that in the spring can have a
big impact on the workforce. In April, the sickness and absence
rate hit 6.2%. This means that if we looked at every day the workforce are
expected to work, just over one in 20 was lost. Just a third of these were due to
coronavirus. A further 20% were due to
mental health problems â including stress or anxiety. Other high reasons for
absences, unrelated to coronavirus, include muscle or bone pain and infections
such as the flu. Travellers returning to the UK from Germany and Sweden from 04:00 GMT on Saturday must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has announced. The two countries are the latest to be removed from the travel corridor list for the whole of the UK. While holidays are currently banned for people living in
England and Wales, work trips are still permitted. Sowhat
are the current quarantine rulesfor travellers? Closing the press conference, Boris Johnson says that ""alas"", he is once again going to have to ask people to ""stay at home"" in an effort to control the virus. But he adds that the country is in a ""far, far better position"" to weather the impact of the second wave of the virus, compared with during the first lockdown. In the final question, a reporter asks about the backlog in non-Covid related testing in hospitals - with more than 1.2m people waiting for tests. Asked if he will provide the funding to bring in the staff and kit to carry out the tests, Johnson says there has ""never been greater investment in the NHS than under this government"". And he says it will continue with more staff recruitment. Sir Simon agrees that there needs to be an expansion in capacity for testing other health issues, and talks of moving scanners onto the high street. But he says waiting lists have not reached the 10 million warning from the summer. He adds: ""One small silver lining of the commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff [during Covid] is they have inspired a new generation of young people to become nurses, doctors and therapists of the future."" Reality Check The prime minister said that the
UK had built the âlargest testing capacity in Europeâ and that âover half a million
tests are available each day"". Earlier this week, the government
said it reached its target to increase testing capacity to 500,00 tests a day -
at the moment it says that labs across the UK are able to process 526,000
swab tests a day. But this doesnât mean they are
actually doing that many tests. In fact, on Tuesday, just over
half that many tests were actually carried out â about 265,000. The government says this gap between capacity and actual tests carried out is deliberate so that they can
deal effectively with surges in demand. Their website says that they should be
processing at a maximum of 85% of capacity. Sir Simon Stevens is asked how confident he is the lockdown will relieve pressures on the NHS quickly enough to allow the measures to lift. In reply, he says they are ""hoping and expecting"" not to see the ""large"" increase in admissions that had been predicted by scientists if no lockdown were imposed. The prime minister is asked whether the government will hand control of the struggling test-and-trace system over to local authorities - currently is is being run by private firms. Boris Johnson admits the tracing scheme ""hasn't had as much impact as we would have wanted"" - but insists it has had some effect in slowing the spread of the virus. He says it ""has taken too long"" for people to get test results - but this is improving, he says. He says mass testing is a ""really promising"" development that could remove the need for people to self-isolate. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Shunning projections that have
proved so controversial, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has
tried to play it straight. He presents a chart showing how
the numbers in hospital have gone up since the summer with more than 11,000 in
hospital in England. He then provides some important context â comparing that with the numbers in hospital with flu â about 3,000 in the depths of winter â or getting treatment for cancer, normally 7,000. The context is important â and shows the burden Covid is placing on the health service. But two things that were not shown were the numbers in hospital at the peak in the spring â 17,000 â or the number of free beds, thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We donât know the latter because NHS bosses are not publishing them. An important point on the day that the UK Statistics Authority calls for greater transparencyover the way Covid data is presented. Next up, a reporter asks about a letter from the UK Statistics Authority which questioned the data presented to the public, saying it had the potential to confuse people. The PM says the government is ""trying to make things as clear as we possibly can"". He admits that projections ""vary widely"" and scientists can disagree, so it is up to government to make ""political judgements"". Johnson says it is ""very, very tough to make exactly the right call"" but some of the data, such as the number of deaths, was ""irrefutable"". He adds: ""I can't quarrel with those data and we have to act on those data."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Christmas is becoming a big
theme in the coronavirus press conferences. Boris Johnson has just struck an
optimistic tone â saying if people follow the rules, as normal a Christmas as
possible will be on the cards. The four governments of the UK have also agreed
to work together on a common strategy. But some are more pessimistic â and
believe big family gatherings are unlikely this year. Asked whether restrictions will have to continue over the New Year, Sir Simon Stevens says this will depend on whether the infection rate comes down over the next month. The NHS England chief executive says the success of controlling the disease will be a ""force multiplier"" in helping the NHS provide ordinary care. The PM is also asked whether he would be able to extend restrictions given opposition to them from the Conservative backbenchers. The PM repeats that the new lockdown law will expire automatically. After this, he says he wants to offer people ""as normal a Christmas as possible"". The next question is about whether we will be able to celebrate Christmas normally. The PM says: ""I perfectly understand why people feel frustrated by the measures... but I also know the overwhelming majority of people will work together to get the R down."" He says it can be done by 2 December, adding: ""I have every confidence we will be able to [get infections down] if we follow this package of measures. ""I [have] no doubt people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible and things can open before Christmas as well."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The government has been asked
today why it didnât extend furlough earlier. For months, opposition parties and
devolved governments have said the scheme should have lasted into winter. The PM is defending the strategy
earlier in the summer to try and wind it down â and ultimately replace it. He
is blaming the âautumn surgeâ for the need to rethink. The first question from a member of the press comes from the BBC's Vicki Young, who asks why the furlough scheme was not extended earlier. Johnson says the scheme has run continuously since the ""onset"" of the crisis and the announcement today will give firms greater certainty. Asked whether the government should have been more cautious in lifting lockdown over the summer, Sir Simon Stevens says the reduction over the summer was ""substantial"". ""When the facts change, you've got to change in accordance with those new facts,"" he says. He adds that the spread of the virus has increased across Europe. In the second question from the public, the PM is asked what consideration has been given to limited vaccine success and how we live with Covid going forward if they don't work. Johnson says there is a ""tripod we are resting our programme on the way ahead"", starting with therapeutics and medicines, moving to the testing regime, and then the vaccines. ""That's the way forward, but if you talk to the scientists they believe things will start naturally to improve in the spring for other reasons"", such as the improvement in weather conditions. The PM adds: ""I think the real progress we are going to see is with science. ""There isn't a virus that has threatened humanity that we haven't beaten."" Sir Simon says there are six ""front runner"" vaccines and the ones coming first are the ""cleverest"", so he remains positive. The first question at todayâs press conference comes from Tom, a member of the public, who asks about the ban on amateur football in England's lockdown. Boris Johnson says he would ""love to be able"" to let this continue, but the ""package of measures"" must be ""complete"" to get the infection rate down. He says this is a ""sad answer"" to have to give. Sir Simon says preparation has been ""substantial"". There is four months of PPE ready and waiting, and staff have been working ""hammer and tongs to catch up on disruption for first wave"". But the message from staff is ""we do need your help"" to ""help us help you"". He concludes by quoting an ICU nurse, who says while we cannot stop heart attacks and strokes, ""we can reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and that is what we need to do to care for everybody who needs it"". Reality Check The prime minister has been
talking about the furlough scheme - which had been extended from the start of
November to 2 December - and has now been extended to the end of March. The scheme will pay up to 80% of a
personâs wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. According to the latest figures up
to 18 October,a total of 9.6 million people had been furloughed at a cost of Â£41.4bn.,external The cost of the scheme per
employee has been falling in recent months, with employers having to pay 0% of
the wage in September and 20% in October. But the government has confirmed
it will be paying the full 80% in November. It will also allow anybody who was
made redundant after 23 September in anticipation of the end of the scheme to
be rehired and put back on furlough. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.8440054e-12
"The governor of the Bank of England has vowed to do ""everything we can"" to support the economy amid a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. Andrew Bailey said it was important that policymakers acted ""quickly and strongly"", as the Bank announced a further Â£150bn of support. Tighter lockdown rules, includingnew restrictions in England, are expected to lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Policymakers also kept interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.1%. While the economy is expected to avoid anotherrecession, the Bank believes unemployment will rise sharply as government support schemes wind down. The Bank expects the economy to shrink by 2% in the final three months of 2020, before bouncing back at the start of 2021, assuming current restrictions loosen. It does not expect the UK economy to get back to its pre-virus size until the following year. Mr Bailey said: ""We are here to do everything we can to support the people of this country - and we'll do it and will do it quickly."" The Covid-19 pandemic triggered thesharpest economic contraction on recordearlier this year as nationwide restrictions were brought in to try to contain the virus. Mr Bailey said the UK had not seen a similar disruption to economic activity in peacetime. ""Even then, these numbers are unprecedented in terms of the scale"", he added. Shoppershelped the economy to bounce backover the summer, and the Bank said retail sales remained strong. Some people had started their Christmas shopping early, while others were buying furniture and household goods to adapt to working from home. However, it said the hospitality, leisure, and tourism sectors had ""suffered from lockdown rules"", and many diners had stopped going to restaurants after the end of theEat Out to Help Out scheme. The Eat Out to Help out scheme announced by Rishi Sunak was popular with diners Fresh restrictions across the UK are expected to drag on growth. The Bank expects the economy to shrink by 11% in 2020. The UK is not predicted tosink into another technical recession- defined as two straight quarters of economic decline. However, policymakers now see a deeper downturn and slower recovery than forecast in August. Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs amid the pandemic, despite various support packages, including anextended furlough scheme. Redundancies have climbed to their highest level since 2009in recent months. The Bank expects unemployment to peak at 7.75% in the middle of next year, from 4.5% currently. This would be the highest rate since 2013. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced that the furlough scheme - under which employees receive 80% of their wages for hours not worked -will now continue until March next year. Sainsbury's to cut 3,500 jobs The Bank of England is in charge of the UK's money supply - how much money is in circulation in the economy. That means it can create new money electronically and the Bank spends most of this money buying government bonds through a process known as quantitative easing (QE). QE is sometimes described as ""printing money"" but in fact no new physical bank notes are created. Government bonds are a type of investment where you lend money to the government. In return, it promises to pay back a certain sum of money in the future, as well as interest in the meantime. Buying billions of pounds' worth of bonds pushes the price up: when demand for anything increases, the price usually goes up too. Will creating billions of pounds save your job? The Bank said Brexit remained a major source of uncertainty for businesses, as negotiations between the UK and EU on a new trade deal continue. A survey by the Bank showed many large businesses were prepared for new trading rules. However, it said even a smooth transition to a Canada-style deal with no tariffs on goods would knock a whole percentage point off growth in the first three months of 2021. It said some shipments were likely to be ""turned back at the border"" for not having the right paperwork, weighing on export activity for the first six months of the year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank's economic forecasts looked optimistic. ""The MPC's forecasts have been updated for the new lockdown plans, but assume that the Covid hit to the economy gradually dissipates and that there is an immediate move to a free trade agreement with the EU in January; the risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside,"" he said. The Bank is currently exploring if it can reduce interest rates below the current level of 0.1%. It wrote to lenders in Octoberto ask them how they would cope with negative rates.Commercial banks have until 12 November to respond. Karen Ward, chief markets strategist at JP Morgan, said pushing interest rates into negative territory was the ""direction of travel"" for many central banks. However, she expects High Street banks to shield savers from being charged. ""It tends to be large corporates that really face those negative interest rates,"" she said. While the Bank of England now expects the economy to contract in the fourth quarter of the year it was careful to say that, because this was just one quarter where the economy shrinks rather than two in a row, it didn't meet the rule of thumb for using the word ""recession"", where it shrinks for six months. So no double dip. But before you say ""Oh that's all right then,"" wait. The projection was that the economy would grow by 4% in the last three months of the year. Now it's expected to shrink by 2%. That's a 6% downgrade - almost as much as the peak-to-trough hit in the financial crisis. Over 2020 it will have shrunk by 11% - and won't get back to pre-Covid levels on the Bank's projections until 2022. There's no official definition of the term ""depression"" and Andrew Bailey resists the term for its 1930s connotations. Informally though it's seen as a deep and prolonged recession where the economy shrinks by more than 10% - or lasts more than three years. On the former but not the latter criterion, our current economic predicament is indeed that bad. What is quantitative easing?

"The government is facing criticism over its guidance on safe visits to care homes in England. Labour and a number of charities have described the suggestions, including floor-to-ceiling screens, designated visitor pods and window visits, as impractical. Alzheimer's Society has said it ""completely misses the point"". Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the guidance was ""non-exhaustive"". The updated government advice,,externalwhich came into effect on Thursday, says care homes - especially those which have not allowed visits since March - ""will be encouraged and supported to provide safe visiting opportunities"". Locked down and lonely: 'Why doesn't anyone want us?' 'We sprang Grandma from the care home' Covid care home policies 'violated human rights' Visits should be ""tailored to residents and facilities and should prioritise residents and staff's safety"" to limit the spread of coronavirus, the advice says, with measures such as social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE). Care minister Helen Whately said the new measures would give people more opportunities to see loved ones ""in a safe way"". However, Julia Jones, co-founder of dementia charity John's Campaign, told the Today programme that visits should be more ""meaningful"" than meeting through a window. ""When people are in the later stages of dementia, when people love each other, when people are approaching the end of their lives, they need to hold hands,"" she said. The chief executive of leading care home group MHA, Sam Monaghan, told the programme the best way to carry out Covid-secure visits in care homes was ""through routine testing of at least one relative for each resident"". Asked about such a scheme, Mr Buckland stressed the government was ""interested in all ideas that are Covid-compliant"" and that the guidance was not an exhaustive list of options. The guidance also suggests: Visitors and residents enter through different entrances, meet in Covid-secure areas/pods separated by floor-to-ceiling screens, and visitors should not enter or pass through the care home Window visits where visitors don't need to come inside the care home or they remain in their car, and the resident is socially distanced Outdoor visits - with one other person - in areas which can be accessed without anyone going through a shared building Virtual visits, with care homes encouraging the use of video calls All face-to-face visits were banned during the first national lockdown in the spring. Guidance in England over recent months has allowed visits on a ""limited basis"" where alternative arrangements were not possible, but visits have been severely curtailed or prohibited entirely in those areas subject to enhanced restrictions, which have applied to large parts of England. Ms Whately said she knew the restrictions on visiting had been ""incredibly painful"" and she had been ""in tears"" with some of the stories she had heard. She said the government was ""absolutely trying to enable more visiting"" but, against the ""backdrop of this second wave"", it was ""only right that we make sure visiting care homes is safe"". She said a trial would start later this week as part of plans to carry out testing on visitors to care homes. The government also said a new national programme for weekly testing of professionals who regularly visit care homes would be ""rolled out in the coming weeks"" following a pilot in Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Northamptonshire. Labour's shadow care minister Liz Kendall said many care homes would not be able to comply with the government's requirements which meant ""in reality thousands of families are likely to be banned from visiting their loved ones"". She said instead of suggesting measures such as screens, the government should ""designate a single family member as a key worker - making them a priority for weekly testing and proper PPE"". Kate Lee, chief executive at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""We're devastated by today's new care home visitor guidance - it completely misses the point: this attempt to protect people will kill them."" She said the pandemic had left people with dementia isolated and thousands had died. The guidelines ""completely ignore the vital role of family carers in providing the care for their loved ones with dementia that no one else can"", she added. She said the ""prison-style screens"" proposed by the government with people speaking through phones were ""frankly ridiculous when you consider someone with advanced dementia can often be bed-bound and struggling to speak"". That view was echoed by Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, who said she was ""acutely aware"" that the methods being sanctioned were ""unlikely to be useable by many older people with dementia, or indeed sensory loss"". She added: ""Overall we think this new guidance is too restrictive. In practice we fear it will result in many care homes halting meaningful visiting altogether, because they will be unable to comply with the requirements laid down.""

"Sainsbury's is to cut 3,500 jobs with the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all its meat, fish and deli counters. The 420 standalone Argos stores will close by March 2024, although Sainsbury's said it would open 150 Argos outlets in its supermarkets. Boss Simon Roberts said Sainsbury's was responding to changing consumer habits and the growth of online shopping. He said the counter closures was a response to lower customer demand and a desire to reduce food waste. The supermarket also reported half-year results, revealing a Â£137m loss which it blamed on closures and ""market changes"". It comes on the day England enters a second lockdown, which Sainsbury's said would continue to accelerate ""a number of shifts in our industry"" as it expands its online and digital operations.

By the end of the restructuring programme, Sainsbury's said it expected the total number of standalone Argos outlets to be about 100. The restructuring will save about Â£600m by 2024, the grocer said. In addition to the 150 Argos stores it plans to open in its supermarkets by 2024, it also plans a further 150-200 collection points. ""We are talking to colleagues today about where the changes we are announcing in Argos standalone stores and food counters impact their roles,"" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's chief executive. ""We will work really hard to find alternative roles for as many of these colleagues as possible and expect to be able to offer alternative roles for the majority of impacted colleagues."" He said the aim was to make Argos ""a simpler, more efficient and more profitable business"". Products from the Habitat brand will also be more widely available in the stores and via Argos. ""Our other brands - Argos, Habitat, Tu, Nectar and Sainsbury's Bank - must deliver for their customers and for our shareholders in their own right,"" he said. Despite the cutting of the 3,500 roles, the supermarket expects that it will have created about 6,000 net new jobs by the end of the year. Sainsbury's said it was responding to changing consumer demands However, the redundancies increase the mounting jobs toll announced by companies facing a coronavirus hit to trading. On Wednesday, John Lewis and Lloyds Banking Group said they were cutting a combined 2,500 jobs. More than 200,000 potential job losses have been announced across sectors including banking, hospitality, travel and retail since the start of Covid-19 pandemic in March. Thousands more workers remain on furlough. Despite Sainsbury's cost-cutting, the company said on Thursday it would pay out a special dividend of 7.3p to shareholders after strong sales in the face of Covid-19. Sainsbury's revealed that total like-for-like sales increased by 6.9% for the 28 weeks to 19 September, helped by an 8.2% growth in groceries.  The supermarket also said there had been ""stronger-than-expected sales, particularly at Argos"". Online sales more than doubled, jumping 117% to Â£5.8bn, as demand for online deliveries surged. Analysts said the Argos restructuring seemed sensible in the current climate, and Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, felt opening more in-store operations could be an ""ace in the hole"" this Christmas. ""The brand is synonymous with festive shopping for a generation of consumers, but it needs to ensure that the delivery service is able to meet demand in lockdown,"" she said. However, John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, said the announcement was an admission that the Â£1.4bn purchase of Argos was a mistake. ""The closure of a further 420... Argos stores says it all. Sainsbury's management clearly did not know how to run Argos and the plan to transplant into spare store space has not worked. ""There was always a concern that Argos and Sainsbury's appealed to very different customer segments with little overlap. That seems now to be true,"" he said. These Argos closures were on the cards long before the pandemic. When Sainsbury's bought the business in 2016, it was clear that hundreds of Argos stores would be closed and relocated inside Sainsbury's supermarkets. This integration is already well under way and it's easy to see why the business is accelerating these plans. Sales at Argos grew by 11% over the last six months despite all its stores being shut during lockdown. It doesn't need as many standalone Argos shops. The company says our shifting shopping habits is also behind the need to close its deli, fresh fish and meat counters. Counters aren't cheap to run and demand, it says, has been falling. Sainsbury's needs to cut costs, partly so it can invest in lowering its prices to keep up with the intense competition. Customers will vote with their feet if they've got it wrong.
