"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for families to be put ""at the heart of our recovery"" from the coronavirus pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to ""protect family incomes"" as it deals with the economic effects of coronavirus. In his first speech of the year, he demanded teachers, the armed forces and care workers are left out of the public sector pay freeze. Sir Keir also called for tougher restrictions to be considered for tackling coronavirus. No 10 said the government had ""shown it is prepared to act"". PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak Drop 'absurd' 5% council tax increase - Starmer Millions 'face Â£1,000 benefit cut' Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze With coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns shutting thousands of businesses, the economy was 7.9% smaller in October last year than it had been six months earlier. And the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, predicts that unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the middle of this year. In his speech, Sir Keir attacked the government for ""having been found wanting at every turn"", accusing Boris Johnson of being ""indecisive"" and acting ""too slow"" over further lockdowns and support for business and families. He said: ""The British people will forgive many things. They know the pandemic is difficult. ""But they also know serial incompetence when they see it - and they know when a prime minister simply isn't up to the job."" But the PM's official spokeswoman rejected the criticism, saying: ""This government has shown it is prepared to act. When given evidence in the morning it has taken action that evening."" Asked by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the government should tighten restrictions, such as closing nurseries, Sir Keir said there ""probably is more that we could do [and we] may have to get tougher"". But he did not outline what measures he would recommend, instead saying it was ""time to hear from the scientists what else can be done - and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". The Labour leader said ministers must ""protect family incomes and support businesses"" from the economic effects of previous restrictions and the current lockdown. He added policies must ""make a real difference to millions of people across the country"" and ""put families at the heart of our recovery"". Sir Keir argued theÂ£20-a-week rise given to Universal Credit claimantslast April must continue beyond this April's cut-off point. Council tax increases in England of up to 5% this April must not happen, he said, while calling forthe ban on evictions and repossessions to be extended. The government's pay freeze for at least 1.3 million public sector workers - which does not apply to NHS frontline staff and those earning below Â£24,000 a year - must not go ahead, said Sir Keir. ""I know this isn't everything that's needed,"" he added, ""and after so much suffering we can't go back the status quo. ""We cannot return to an economy where over half our care workers earn less than the living wage, where childcare is among the most expensive in Europe, where our social care system is a national disgrace and where over four million children grow up in poverty."" An opposition leader has no policy leavers to pull. They have to rely on words to persuade the public they are worthy of power. With the next general election an eternity away, Sir Keir Starmer knows the question of competence matters far more to voters than ideology right now. The Labour leader was unsparing in his criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic - accusing the prime minster of serial incompetence, dithering and delay. Sir Keir said the government could reverse planned changes to council tax and universal credit to ease the financial pressure on families. But pressed on how lockdown might be different today if he was in No 10, the Labour leader mirrored the government's messaging. He said there was ""probably"" more that could be done around nurseries and estate agent viewings, but Sir Keir's mantra was listen to the scientists. It's what ministers say endlessly too. Sir Keir argued that, just as a Labour government ""built the welfare state from the rubble"" of World War Two, a future one can ""secure our economy, protect our NHS and rebuild our country so that Britain is the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in"". But Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling accused Sir Keir of ""calling for actions the Conservatives are already taking in government"". ""We have delivered an unprecedented Â£280bn package of support to protect jobs, livelihoods and public services through this pandemic,"" she added, including the furlough scheme, the temporary increase to Universal Credit and extra funding for councils. ""The Conservatives will continue to put families and communities at the heart of every decision we take as we deliver on our promises to the British people,"" Ms Milling said. In his Spending Review in November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun. He promised to take ""extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

The woman, who was Tasered during the arrest, also suffered non life-threatening injuries. She has been taken to hospital, the Met Police said.

The men who were found seriously injured on Sunday morning died at the scene ""I got changed out my PJs and went outside and asked one of the neighbours opposite what happened.

"NI's six health trusts have warned that by the third week of January, NI hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients. In ajoint statement,external, the trust chief executives said the figures were based on modelling projections. They also said there were staffing concerns at a time when there are increased numbers of patients. Earlier on Sunday night, the Western Health Trust issued an appeal to off-duty staff. It called for any staff near South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to either contact the trust or go to the hospital. The hospital has additional beds and the staff were wanted so it could help out the Southern Health Trust, which was under severe pressure at Craigavon Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital. The Western Trust has since said it was ""overwhelmed by the offers of help and support from"" staff and that the situation has now stabilised. It added that it no longer anticipated patients being diverted from Craigavon or Daisy Hill to SWAH. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Western Trust chief executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said NI hospitals are ""facing into an abyss."" She added: ""We can say that this situation is more grave than it has ever been in the course of this pandemic. ""At the moment one in four of the people in our hospitals have Covid-19. It's about 700 people. ""At the peak of the first surge there were 400 people in hospital so already we're in a very grave situation."" On Sunday there were 703 people in hospital with the virus, 53 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 34 being ventilated. Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said staff were working ""above their contracted obligations, are overworked and overtired"". She added that any attempt to force them to cancel annual leave would be ""inhumane"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to ""voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks"". In the joint statement, trust executives urged the public to ""stay at home, practise social distancing, hand hygiene and wear face coverings."" In December they warned""several of NI's acute hospitals were operating beyond capacity"". In their latest statement, the trusts said dealing with the pandemic was now ""not a simple matter of putting up more beds."" The statement said: ""We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. ""Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren't there."" Seventeen more coronavirus-related deaths have been reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. It takes its death toll to 1,460. Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal' Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery In their statement, the trusts made reference to thestanding down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery. ""This was to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both Covid and non-Covid patients needing ICU care,"" they said. The trusts said the postponed operations would be rescheduled as soon as possible. They added that patients who did undergo surgery may need to travel further for it. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options. They said that staff ""although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it."" However, the chief executives added that it would not be easy and the ""care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best."" In December some patients had to be treated in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital The trusts also warned the public that no-one should be attending a hospital emergency department at any time unless they need emergency care and said longer waits were likely They added that patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. ""This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to life threatening emergencies in the community,"" the statement said. The trusts said the vaccines rollout ""provides the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge."" The Health Department anticipates the vaccination programme will continue until the summer of 2021. New lockdownrestrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. In the Republic of Ireland the Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday, bringing its death toll to 2,344. It said there are 6,888 new cases and 125 people are in ICU. Earlier this week, the reproductive rate of the virus in Northern Ireland - known as the R-number - was sitting at about 1.8.

"Dorset Police said officers dispersed dozens of demonstrators from the town centre as they attempted to march A video shared online apparently showing a woman being arrested in breach of lockdown for sitting on a bench was ""stage-managed"", police said. Dorset Police believe the video was planned and recorded by anti-lockdown protesters during a demonstration in Bournemouth on Saturday. Three people were arrested for not giving their details so officers could issue fines for breaking Covid rules. The BBC has asked one of the protesters who posted the video to comment. The force said two of those held were later de-arrested when they confirmed their details in police custody and a third was released when his details were verified - all three were then issued fixed penalty notices. Officers also issued at least seven other fines and 10 dispersal notices. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan, from Dorset Police, said: ""We believe this video was planned, stage-managed and recorded by members of the protest group who turned up in multiple areas, several of whom refused to engage or provide their details. ""If people refuse to give their details in such circumstances then it leaves officers with little option, but to arrest until the details are established. Our officers would only arrest as a last resort. ""It was clear that the group was deliberately organising their activities, walking around in twos and then trying to come together in a 'flash mob'-style approach, as they have done previously. This activity went on for a couple of hours."" The force's chief constable James Vaughan earlier said: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" The force said there were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest and found a number of the protesters had ""travelled considerably"" from out of the Dorset area. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? Sam Crowe, director of public health for Dorset, said its hospital services were ""close to being overwhelmed"". Mr Crowe said: ""Infection rates locally have been doubling in less than a week. If this carries on, our hospitals will not be able to cope with caring for those needing life-saving treatment. Stay at home means exactly that.""

"An ambulance had to be lifted out of the mud Rescuers searching for victims of a landslide in Indonesia were buried by a second mudslide just hours later, officials say. The first landslide, in Cihanjuang village, West Java, was triggered by torrential rain. Another struck as survivors were still being evacuated. At least 12 people died and dozens more are missing. Landslides are common in Indonesia during rainy season, and often blamed on deforestation. The latest disasters hit the villagers in Sumedang regency, about 150km (95 miles) southeast of the capital Jakarta, three and a half hours apart on Saturday. The first happened at 16:00 (09:00 GMT) and the second at 19:30 (12:30 GMT), disaster agency spokesman Raditya Jati said in a statement. ""The first landslide was triggered by high rainfall and unstable soil conditions. The subsequent landslide occurred while officers were still evacuating victims around the first landslide area,"" he added. Rescuers are believed to be among those killed, he added. A six-year-old boy was also among the dead, according to AFP news agency. Some 27 people were believed to be missing late on Sunday, local media quoted Deden Ridwansah, the head of the local search and rescue agency as saying. About 46 were known to have survived. Bad weather had forced the search to be suspended, he said, but it was expected to resume on Monday. Indonesia frequently suffers floods and landslides.

"Workers in Madrid clear a hospital entrance of snow Spain is in a race against time to clear roads covered by heavy snow, and get Covid vaccines and food supplies to areas affected by Storm Filomena. Up to 50cm (20 inches) of snow fell on the capital Madrid, one of the worst hit areas, between Friday and Saturday. At least four people died and thousands of travellers were left stranded. Overnight, temperatures plunged to -8C (18F) in parts of Spain, amid warnings by meteorologists that the snow was turning to perilous ice. The unusual cold wave on the Iberian peninsula is expected to last until Thursday. The Spanish government said it had taken extra steps - including police-escorted convoys - to ensure its expected shipment of some 300,000 coronavirus vaccines can be distributed as planned to regional health authorities later on Monday. ""The commitment is to guarantee the supply of health, vaccines and food. Corridors have been opened to deliver the goods,"" Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said on Sunday. This video can not be played Madrid has been hit by heavy snowfall after Storm Filomena Soldiers have been deployed to clear some of the 700 major roads. Some 3,500 tonnes of salt were later brought on lorries to the capital, Spain's El Mundo website reported on Monday. The record-breaking snowfall has triggered some unprecedented scenes here in Madrid. People have skied along the city's main commercial street, Gran VÃ­a, and one man was pictured being pulled through the district of Hortaleza on a sled by five huskies. But other responses to the snow have been more controversial due to concerns about Covid-19. Dozens of young people had a snowball fight in Callao square, for example, and many of them were without facemasks. Nearby, in Puerta del Sol, others celebrated the snow by dancing a conga. The daily Marca newspaper branded it ""the conga of shame"". Although the snowfall has now stopped, low temperatures have left snow and ice piled up across the capital and the surrounding region. And with residents advised to avoid using their cars, public transport has seen a surge in demand. This has compounded coronavirus concerns as many metro train carriages were packed at rush hour on Monday morning, making social distancing impossible. Madrid's international airport began gradually resuming operations on Sunday afternoon, having cancelled all flights on Friday. Some 500 people across the Madrid region were forced to spend the night in temporary shelter, including sports centres, after they were trapped by the whiteout. About 100 shoppers and staff spent two nights at a shopping centre in Majadahonda, a town north of the capital. ""There are people sleeping on the ground on cardboard,"" one restaurant employee told TVE television. Spain's Meteorological Agency said Saturday's snowfall was the heaviest in Madrid since 1971 But there were stories of heroism too, including doctors and medical workers who abandoned their cars and walked for hours to get to work. One doctor, Alvaro Sanchez, said on social media he had walked 17km (10 miles) over nearly two hours to get to work, while two nurses, Paco and Monica, said they had walked 22km to their hospital. They were praised by Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa, who tweeted: ""The commitment that the entire group of health workers is showing is an example of solidarity and dedication."" Some 4x4 vehicle owners offered to transport medical workers, while other volunteers helped to clear hospital entrance ways. ""Health staff have been working (hard) for more than a year and this is just a short moment for us, so as citizens, we are trying to help; it is everyone's responsibility,"" said Fernando de la Fuente, 60, who helped clear the entrance to Madrid's Gregorio Maranon Hospital.

"Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live about 30 to 45 minutes' drive away from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. The seven centres include Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, London's Nightingale hospital, Newcastle's Centre for Life, the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre, Robertson House in Stevenage and Birmingham's Millennium Point. People will not miss out on their vaccination if they do not use the letters to make an appointment at one of the centres, the NHS said. Two Labour MPs tweeted about their concerns about the letters being delayed in getting out to people due to coronavirus affecting Royal Mail staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mary McGarry from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire told BBC News that her letter points to an NHS online booking page which suggests she would have to take her husband, who has cancer and a lung disease, 20 miles to Birmingham. ""We're very reluctant to go into Birmingham city centre,"" she said. ""If we can't get somebody to take us, we'd have to go on the train but we're shielding because my husband's got poor health.... we want to know why we've got to travel that far?"" Kay Hayward, from Whitwick in Leicestershire, said she went online to book an appointment for her 85-year-old husband Kenneth and was offered five different places including Widnes in Cheshire and Stevenage in Hertfordshire. ""I thought they must be joking... we talked about it and we thought it was actually safer to stay here and for him not not have it. 130,000 letters have been sent out by NHS England so far ""But we were worried if we turned this down, we'd be off the list.. the letter doesn't say anything about having the vaccines anywhere else locally."" Andrea Eaton, from Coventry, said she was so angry that her 81-year-old mother, who has heart problems and leukaemia, was offered Birmingham for her appointment that she attempted to ring Downing Street on Saturday night to complain. She said she reached the press office and said: ""I want you to give Boris a message please that he has lied to the British public. ""He has told themthey never need to go more than 10 miles... they were really rude and just put the phone down on me."" Andrea Eaton said she wanted to get a message to Boris Johnson so rang Downing Street on Saturday evening A spokesperson from Number 10 told BBC News that they did not wish to comment, but wanted to remind the public to use the government website to write to the prime minister or contact their constituency MP. Councillor Shaun Davies, the Labour leader at Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said he had been contacted by dozens of people who have found the letters misleading, thinking this is their only chance to get the vaccine. He said he had spoken to Trafford Council and was aware of people in Shropshire being sent to Manchester and residents there being directed to Birmingham to get their jabs. ""For many people they have been told consistently to wait for the NHS to contact you in order to get a vaccine and that's what they've had for the first time as a piece of communication. ""This is really, really concerning for people in their 80s or 90s because of the importance of getting the vaccine."" The letters are not ""going to the heart"" of the public health message which is staying home and staying local, he said. More than 500,000 letters will be sent out to homes offering people appointments at the centres over the next seven days Dr Sarah Raistrick, from Coventry and Rugby Clinical Commission group (CCG), said people did not have to travel to the centres but admitted the letter did not make that clear. ""You can wait and be contacted by your local GP service and have it locally if you'd prefer. ""If you sit tight, you will be contacted and I'm hopeful that if you're 80 or over, by the end of this month you will have had your vaccination whether that is locally or whether you have chosen to travel,"" she said.

"Flat owners applying to a fund to help pay to remove flammable building cladding will be told not to talk to the press without government approval. A draft agreement, uncovered by the Sunday Times, says that even where there is ""overwhelming public interest"" in speaking to journalists, the government must be told first. The government said the wording was ""standard"". It set up a Â£1.6bn fund last year to repair the most dangerous buildings. But it warned that the fund might not cover all the costs of removing the cladding. The clause might affect building owners and professional managing agents but also residents who manage their building. Some types of the covering, often added to newer blocks of flats, have been proven to be a fire hazard. After the 2017 Grenfell fire, the government pledged that safe alternatives to dangerous cladding would be provided on all buildings in England taller than 18m. It set up the Â£1.6bn fund to help foot the costs. 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Cladding red tape 'stops people selling homes' The agreement, between the building owner or leaseholder and the government, says: ""The Applicant shall not make any communication to the press or any journalist or broadcaster regarding the Project or the Agreement (or the performance of it by any Party) without the prior written approval of Homes England and [the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government ]"" and its press offices. It says an exception can be made ""where such disclosure is in the overwhelming public interest (in which case disclosure will not be made without first allowing Homes England and MHCLG to make representations on such proposed disclosure)."" TheUK Cladding Action Group,externaltweeted that it was ""clearly a matter of public interest"" that these issues were aired in public. ""No department should be hiding behind non-disclosure agreements to stop scrutiny of their actions,"" the group said. 'Institutional failure' Another campaign group, Manchester Cladiators, said the existence of the ""gagging clause"" was ""shocking but not necessarily that surprising"". Spokesperson Rebecca Fairclough said residents would feel ""intimidated"" by it, adding: ""We ask the government to remove this unfair clause immediately and focus on the priority of solving this institutional failure, which still exists and is only growing over three and a half years after the Grenfell tragedy."" The government insists that the wording in the agreement, under the heading ""Marketing material"", is there to ensure applicants come to the government first. ""The terms set out are standard in commercial agreements and are not specific to this fund - to suggest otherwise is misleading and inaccurate,"" the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said in a statement. ""We want a constructive working relationship with building owners who apply to the fund and applicants are asked to work with the department on public communications relating to the project.""

"The number of patients in intensive care with Covid has risen sharply, amid warnings that tougher lockdown measures may be needed. Latest Scottish government figures show 1,877 new cases of Covid were reported in the last 24 hours The number of people in intensive care has risen from 109 to 123, the highest daily jump since October. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said a tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. A total of 1,598 people are currently in hospital with recently-confirmed Covid, up from Saturday's figure of 1,596 patients which was the highest number since the outbreak began. The daily test positivity rate was10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. Oxford vaccine to be rolled out from Monday Tesco staff 'devastated' at deaths of two colleagues Where will I get my vaccine? The deputy first minister said the country was facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus. Speaking on Politics Scotland, Mr Swinney said coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" and he would not rule out tougher lockdown measures. He said: ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" There have been some encouraging signs in recent days with average positivity rates falling, a possible indicator that the lockdown is having an impact, but  Prof Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University, urged caution. She said: ""The numbers are not reducing at the rate which we want them to, so [it is] still a very fragile situation. ""The measures we have now I hope are working but it's not clear whether they are tough enough. ""I think the key change the government could make is in the sectors which are still open, particularly workplaces but also things like takeaways and click and collect."" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government is ""open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary"" Professional sport, along with manufacturing and construction work have been allowed to continue in this lockdown, whereas they were not in the first wave in March. The deputy first minister said the meeting of the cabinet which agreed the latest lockdown saw ministers wondering if they had gone far enough to stop the spread. Mr Swinney added: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough.""

"A crisis centre for relatives has been set up at the airport in Jakarta Relatives of the passengers and crew on board the ill-fated Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 are facing an agonising wait as authorities search for the wreckage. Sixty-two people were on board the passenger plane which plunged into the sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta on Saturday. There appears to be no hope of finding survivors. Although no-one on board has been formally identified, information is emerging from family and friends. Indonesia crashed plane's black boxes located ""We're in grief, still praying for the best,"" said Ferza Mahardhika, whose uncle was the pilot of the Sriwijaya SJ182 flight. Captain Afwan, 54, left home quickly on the day of the doomed flight, his nephew told BBC Indonesia, complaining that ""his shirt hadn't been ironed, when usually he is really neat"". The captain apologised to his three children for having to leave them again. Captain Afwan, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, started his flying career in the air force before becoming a commercial pilot in 1987. His family and colleagues say he was devoted Muslim, eager to help people in his neighbourhood in the West Java town of Bogor, and at work. His profile picture on social media is a cartoon of Superman praying, with the words ""it doesn't matter how high you fly, you will never reach heaven if you don't pray"". This video can not be played Indonesian divers search crash wreckage ""He was a very good man. He often gave advice, wise advice. He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,"" said Ferza Mahardhika. ""I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family,"" he added. Also on board was 15-year-old Dinda Amelia, who had originally gone to Jakarta on vacation. Dinda had gone with her mother's employer whom she was close to, along with the family's two children. Lena, her mother, said she had been working for her employer's family for a long time, and so did not refuse Dinda's request to follow the family on vacation. Lena's mother holding a photo of her daughter They left for Jakarta on 27 December - but never returned. ""She left right on her 15th birthday,"" her mother told BBC Indonesian. ""She was very happy."" Speaking to reporters, Lena showed them a photo of Dinda on her phone, while crying and saying: ""Come back little one."" Angga Fernanda Afrion's mother, Afrida, is pictured holding a photograph of her son Afrida told BBC Indonesia she was still holding out hope that her 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion, who was on the flight, might still be alive. ""Family members who are in Jakarta are searching for information. I want to go, too, but with the pandemic it's difficult to travel,"" said Afrida, who lives in West Sumatra. Just a week ago Angga - a seaman - had become a father, his wife giving birth to their first child, a boy named Alvano Faeyza Alingga. His mother said that becoming a father had motived him to work harder to provide the best for his son. Angga worked on large cargo boats. His mother says he called her late on Friday saying that he had to fly to Pontianak at the last minute because ""his ship was damaged and his boss had told him he needed to come"". He often had to travel for work across the Indonesian archipelago but preferred to travel by boat, rarely flying. Afrida said her son was ""a strong-willed child but was very obedient. He was a kind polite person and could get on well with anyone."" ""If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,"" she said quietly, while holding a framed photo of Angga in his uniform. Also on board were newly married couple Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and Putri Wahyuni. Ihsan's younger brother, Arwin Amru Hakim, told news website Kompas that his brother had called from Soekarno Hatta Airport to let the family know their flight had been delayed, due to bad weather. The couple were travelling to Kalimantan to hold a wedding party for Ihsan's extended family who live in Pontianak. ""The plan was that next Saturday the event would take place,"" said Arwin.

"Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they needed to ""act with urgency"" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stepped up the pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to act to remove Donald Trump from office over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Lawmakers are expected to bring up a resolution asking Mr Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office. Mr Pence is said to oppose the idea. If he refuses, the House will hold a vote to impeach Mr Trump who had urged supporters to march on the Capitol. The Republican president has been accused by Democrats and an increasing number of fellow Republicans over the riot, following a rally in which Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated allegations of vote fraud. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol police officer. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he wasbanned from several social media platforms- including Twitter - on Friday. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn is as president. Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony. What is the 25th Amendment? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Ms Pelosi wrote to lawmakers saying the House of Representatives would present a resolution on Monday to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which would allow Mr Pence to remove Mr Trump from the White House and become acting president. The House could vote on the resolution on Tuesday. After that, Mr Pence and the cabinet would be given 24 hours to act before the House's potential move toward impeachment. ""We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent,"" Ms Pelosi said in her letter on Sunday. ""The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action."" Although Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president by saying on Sunday he planned to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment. Meanwhile, a second Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said the president should ""resign and go away as soon as possible"", joining Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ In a separate development, First Lady Melania Trump, who rarely makes public comments about political events, condemned Wednesday's violence,saying the ""nation must heal in a civil manner"".,external ""I implore people to stop the violence, never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin or use differing political ideologies as a basis for aggression and viciousness,"" she said in a statement called Our Path Forward released by the White House. House Democrats have vowed to press ahead quickly with impeachment. To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress, and Ms Pelosi said Democrats could introduce a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" against Mr Trump. Senior lawmakers say a vote to impeach Mr Trump in the House could be held by mid-week. Mr Trump could become the only president in US history to have been impeached twice. Proceedings would then move to the Senate for a trial, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal. If he is convicted, the Senate could also hold a vote to bar Mr Trump from holding public office again. Could Trump be removed from power? The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters However, House whip James Clyburn, another senior Democrat, told CNN the party may not send any impeachment articles to the Senate until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office, saying: ""Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running."" That would allow Mr Biden to confirm his new cabinet and kickstart key policies including tackling coronavirus, something that would have to wait if the Senate had already received the impeachment articles. This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' No Republican senators have said they will vote to convict Mr Trump of wrongdoing. The White House and senior Republicans have dismissed impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"". Mr Biden has said impeachment is for Congress to decide, even though he has thought ""for a long time President Trump was not fit to hold the job"". As investigators try to prosecute rioters who stormed the Capitol, police departments in Virginia and Washington state have placed officers on administrative leave for allegedly attending the events while off-duty. Fire departments in Florida and New York City have also said some of their members may have been present when the mob broke into the Capitol, according to Reuters news agency. In other developments: The White House said the president would travel to Texas on Tuesday to visit a stretch of the border wall with Mexico to highlight his administration's work there The Professional Golfers' Association of America has cut its ties with Mr Trump, voting to take the PGA Championship event away from his New Jersey golf course next year Former Republican California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger labelled Mr Trump as the ""worst president ever"" in a social media video,likening Wednesday's violence to that of the Kristallnacht,external, or the Night of Broken Glass, during which Jewish property was destroyed in Nazi Germany in 1938 Mr Biden has nominated William Burns, a former career diplomat, as CIA director The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters What to expect from Trump's Senate trial Donald Trump to snub Joe Bidenâs inauguration At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Parts of the fuselage of the plane have apparently been recovered ""Black boxes"" from a passenger plane that crashed into the sea soon after take-off in Indonesia on Saturday have been located, officials say. Navy divers are confident that they will be able retrieve the two flight recorders when the search operation resumes on Monday. Aircraft parts and human remains have been found. The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 was carrying 62 people when it vanished from radar on its journey to Borneo. ""We have located the position of the black boxes, both of them,"" said Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, quoted by AFP earlier on Sunday. ""Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them."" The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or black boxes as they are often called, store data about planes. They can provide vital information in air accident investigations. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? Investigators are analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among crash missing A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 The search operation has been suspended for the night but is due to resume on Monday morning. However, there appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Debris believed to belong to the Sriwijaya Air flight that disappeared shortly after take-off from Jakarta A spokesman for the Jakarta police, Yusri Yunus, said two bags had been received from the search and rescue agency. ""The first bag contained passengers' properties, another bag contained body parts,"" he told reporters, adding: ""We are still identifying these findings."" Police are asking families of the victims to provide DNA samples and dental records to help identify the remains. Indonesian investigators inspect an item they believe could belong to the missing plane The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. The aircraft did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously for newsat the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Afrida's 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion was on the flight. Angga, a merchant seaman, had been told to go to Pontianak because his ship was damaged, she said. Just a week ago he had become a father. ""If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,"" she told BBC Indonesia. Family members of missing passengers wait for news at Pontianak airport, Indonesia Meanwhile relatives of the plane's captain, Afwan, a former air force pilot, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, described him as a devout Muslim and a ""very good man"". ""He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,"" says his nephew Ferza Mahardhika. ""I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family."" According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash.

"Online supermarket Ocado has become the first big retailer to warn of shortages of some products. It told customers in an email that there may be ""an increase of missing items and substitutions over the next few weeks"". Staff sickness and self-isolation means some food producers are cutting the number of product lines they offer. While customers might not get their exact product choice, plenty of food should be available, Ocado said. ""Staff absences across the supply chain may lead to an increase in product substitutions for a small number of customers as some suppliers consolidate their offering to maintain output,"" a spokesperson said. Food waste: 'I'll have to throw away Â£6,000-worth of milk' The news comes after a rush of online food orders for supermarkets, as shoppers try to stay at home after the new lockdown started. Within a couple of hours of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Monday, shoppers reported problems with Sainsbury's and Tesco, while Ocado customers were placed in a virtual queue. Ocado told its customers that from Friday ""changes to the UK supply chain have affected some of our suppliers and may result in an increase of missing items and substitutions over the next few weeks."" It added: ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused and we are working hard to mitigate any impact."" Food suppliers are grappling with staffing problems, hospitality clients who have closed their doors and delays at the border with the EU. Wholesalers the BBC spoke to this week said they facedthrowing away thousands of pounds worth of foodbecause of cancelled orders following new restrictions. The UK meat industry has called for the early vaccination of its workers to keep food supplies running smoothly during the coronavirus crisis. It warned earlier this week that absences during the pandemic, coupled with disruption at ports, could hit food supply chains. An early vaccination call for supermarket staff was also made by the boss of Sainsbury's on Thursday. The government said the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people have the food they need. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said coronavirus and disruption at ports due to new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period were ""a severe challenge to the industry and to the smooth running of the nation's food supply chain"".

"Sir Keir Starmer has said the ""status quo isn't working"" for Scotland but has again rejected calls for a second independence referendum. The Labour leader, whobacks devolving more powers from Westminster, claimed another vote would be ""divisive"". However, he said he did not agree withBoris Johnson's assessmentthat there should not be another referendum for at least 40 years. The SNP said a vote would allow Scots to choose how to rebuild after Covid. Last year Sir Keir said he would set up a constitutional commission to offer a ""positive alternative to the Scottish people"". He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I don't think there should be another referendum, I don't think a further divisive referendum is the way forward. ""But I do accept that the status quo isn't working. I don't accept the argument that the status quo isn't working, the next thing you do is go to a referendum. ""I think there are other things you can do, other arguments that can be made in support of the United Kingdom."" Boris Johnson says indyref vote should be once-in-generation Sir Keir Starmer promises to shift power from Westminster Is Scotland moving towards independence? Asked about Boris Johnson's 40-year position, Sir Keir replied: ""I heard the prime minister say that and I don't agree with him on that."" Speaking on BBC Politics Scotland, Deputy First minister John Swinney rejected suggestions that the recovery from the Covid crisis should be a greater priority than another independence vote. He said:  ""An independence referendum is an essential priority of the people of Scotland because it gives us the opportunity to choose how we rebuild as a country from Covid. ""It would give us the opportunity to decide on our constitutional future and to determine the nature of our economy and how we deal with and support our citizens."" Earlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC he thought the 41-year interval between the UK's referendums on joining the EU and leaving it was a ""good sort of gap"". Mr Johnson said in his experience, such votes ""don't have a notably unifying force in the national mood, they should be only once in a generation"".

"Wales has received 275,000 doses of the two Covid-19 vaccines to deal with the pandemic. About 70,000 people received a first dose after the first month of the vaccine rollout. The Welsh Government confirmed it has had more than 250,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 25,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The health minister promised a ""really significant step-up"" in the roll-out after opponents criticised its speed. The Pfizer jabs were first administered in early Decemberat seven sites across Wales as part of the UK-wide immunisation programme. Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs This 82-year-old woman was one of 100 to receives her vaccine at a special clinic in Swansea on Saturday Approximately 1.6% of people were vaccinated up to 3 January - fewer than all other UK nations. In England, about 1.9% of the population had received the first dose, while 2.1% of people in both Scotland and Northern Ireland had received their first jab. The Welsh Government has dismissed criticism it is lagging behind, with health officials saying the new Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would help speed up the programme ""considerably"". Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine started on Monday, with 25,000 doses received this week, according to the Welsh Government. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Friday that Wales would receive another 25,000 Oxford doses next week and 80,000 the week after that. When asked how many doses of the Pfizer vaccine Wales had received, he said he could not recall the exact figure but further deliveries had been received ""on the 23rd and the 27th of December"". Pressed on a figure, he said: ""It's the low hundreds of thousands"", adding: ""The Pfizer vaccine has particular challenges in terms of the conditions that it's got to be stored in and in parts of Wales that is a very particular challenge because it is a hard vaccine to transport over long distances to relatively scattered and remote communities. ""But the fact that we've got it and the fact that we're able to use more of it than we originally anticipated means we'll be able to accelerate the use of it over the next couple of weeks."" These were the latest comparative weekly totals - daily updates are promised from this week onwards in Wales On Sunday, the Welsh Government confirmed it had received 25,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the first week but the quantity would increase, allocated to Wales based on a population share on a weekly basis. ""We are confident in the assurances we have been given that this will increase over the next few weeks to around 100,000 per week,"" they said. ""We are delivering all the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine allocated to Wales directly to GPs, other primary care providers and hospitals as soon as it is available."" Conservative MP for the Vale of Clwyd, Dr James Davies, said: ""We all know that the Pfizer vaccine is difficult to transport and store and needs to be stored at -70 degrees, that's understood. ""But the issue is that actually, if you look at the rest of the UK, including very rural areas, they've managed to deal with it... and it is difficult to see why they haven't been in a position to be organised earlier and to ramp-up the delivery."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, called for transparency: ""It is very worrying to find out that we have had in Wales more than 250,000 doses but only a relatively small proportion of that have yet ended up in people's arms, protecting people, because that's what we want to happen."" He has written an open letter to Health Minister Vaughan Gething calling for greater clarity on the vaccine deployment programme, asking for a dashboard of information which would allow the public to track the rollout's progress for themselves, including volume of doses delivered and administered by health board and by the nine priority groups. Dr Olwen Williams, vice-president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, also called on health boards and Welsh Government to publish regular data showing which groups of people have been vaccinated, with patient-facing health workers prioritised over other colleagues. ""I think that would give assurance to people working in the NHS and the population in general, that the programme is progressing as planned,"" she said. All data will be published daily from Monday but Mr Gething conceded that Wales, from last week's figures, was ""slightly behind on the population share and I'm not getting away from that."" He said the race was not ""necessarily against other UK nations"" but against the virus. He also told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementthat, in the next two to three weeks, he expected to see a ""really significant step-up in the delivery of the vaccine"" as more GP practices and community pharmacies help. ""We're going to get through many more people, giving them significant protection with a first vaccine,"" he said. ""And that will mean that we're going to be able to prevent most of the avoidable deaths."" It is hoped the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will speed up the process. By the end of last week, it was being offered to patients aged over 80 at 73 GP practices. More than 100 are expected to be offering the jabs next week, Mr Gething said, ""and then we get into several hundred thereafter and we'll bring community pharmacies on board."" The UK and Scottish governments did not provide the numbers of Pfizer vaccines supplied to England and Scotland. BBC Wales is still waiting for a response from the Northern Irish Executive. Meanwhile, regular rapid testingfor people without coronavirus symptoms will be made availablein England. The Welsh Government said it would evaluate itsmass testing pilots in Merthyr Tydfilandlower Cynon Valley, as well as elsewhere in the UK, to inform its approach to community testing. A spokesman added: ""We have announced regular asymptomatic testing of health and social care workers, in education and daily contact testing in South Wales Police. ""A pilot has also started at the Tata Port Talbot site. We are also exploring other opportunities for regular testing to support critical services.""

"Flexing the coronavirus lockdown rules could be fatal, the health secretary has warned as hospital admissions soar. Matt Hancock did not rule out strengthening current restrictions and told the BBC's Andrew Marr the NHS was under ""very serious pressure"". It comes after almost 55,000 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and the number of deaths after a positive test passed 80,000. Scientist Prof Peter Horby warned the UK was in ""the eye of the storm"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the rules were tough but ""may not be tough enough"" and called for the government to hold daily press conferences to avoid ""mixed messages"". The UK recorded another 563 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test on Sunday, down from 1,065 deaths on Saturday. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were also a further 54,940 daily cases. What's still allowed during lockdown? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr ""every time you try to flex the rules that could be fatal"" and said staying at home was the ""most important thing we can do collectively as a society"". The health secretary said he did not want to speculate on whether the government would further strengthen restrictions,after warnings from scientists on Saturday that they may need to be stricter. ""People need to not just follow the letter of the rules but follow the spirit as well and play their part,"" he said. His comments came afterHome Secretary Priti Patel defended police over enforcing lockdown rulesfollowing the case of two women who were fined for going for a walk five miles from their homes -a decision which is now under review. The governmenthas launched a campaigntelling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said that if the virus continued on its current trajectory ""many hospitals will be in real difficulties, and very soon"". In a statement released on Sunday,,externalhe said that unless people started to follow the rules more strictly, emergency patients will have to be turned away from hospitals, causing ""avoidable deaths"". Prof Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there may be ""early signs that something is beginning to bite"" due to the restrictions - but if they did not then stricter measures would be needed. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I really hope people take this very seriously. It was bad in March, it's much worse now. ""We've seen record numbers across the board, record numbers of cases, record numbers of hospitalisations, record numbers of deaths."" This video can not be played Professor Peter Horby explains why the new Covid-19 variant is up to 70% more transmissible Prof Horby said tougher measures might include those during the March lockdown, such as people only being able to exercise once a day and stricter rules about meeting people. ""We are in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky,"" he said. Prof Horby said early signs were encouraging that the vaccines would be effective against the new Covid variants - first identified in the UK and in South Africa - and he did not want people to ""hide under the duvet"". ""We can see the end game now,"" he said. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more ""transmissible"", possibly because each infected individual produces more of the actual virus - sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from serious symptoms but we don't yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be needed to bring the R-number below one and start to reduce the overall size of the pandemic. Mass community testing is to be rolled out this week, the government has said, and the health secretary said around two million people had been vaccinated in the UK, with some 200,000 jabs being given in England daily. Mr Hancock said by autumn every adult in the UK would be offered a vaccine. He said the government was on course to reach its target of 15 million people vaccinated by mid-February, with the opening of seven mass vaccination centres this week likely to increase the rate of jabs. Mr Hancock told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he hoped coronavirus could be treated like seasonal flu with an annual vaccination programme in the future. Prof Horby said the vaccines may have to be updated ""every few years"" as the virus mutates and said it was unlikely the virus would go away completely. ""We're going to have to live with it,"" he said. ""But that may change significantly. ""It may well become more of an endemic virus that's with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths but is not causing the huge disruption that we're seeing now.""

"The Oxford vaccine rollout started in Wales earlier this week - those figures are not yet included More than 14,000 people had their first dose of the Covid-19 jab in Wales in the past week, the latest figures show. It takes the numbers on the priority list to have got the Pfizer-BioNTech jab to 49,403 since the rollout started on 8 December. But Wales is lagging behind the rest of the UK so far, with a lower proportion of people getting a first dose. The Welsh Government said that by next week, 60 GP practices and 20 centres would be vaccinating. Health officials said the new Oxford vaccine would help speed up the programme ""considerably"". The numbers do not include the first people to receive the new vaccine, which began to be given this week. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the real numbers were likely to be higher, with the figures a snapshot based on those vaccines recorded electronically so far. They give a breakdown by health board and also show how many people have been given their first dose. The figures also include people, such as NHS staff, who work in Wales but live over the border, but do not yet give details of people in different priority categories. Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said: ""We need real transparency on progress of the vaccination process. ""This must include clear targets and data on how many vaccines come to Wales, and how many are distributed and given out by each health board to each priority group - both the first and second doses - so we can measure this against the targets. This is how confidence can be built that Wales is on track."" The Welsh Government said: ""These are early days in our mass vaccination programme. Momentum will continue to build and the speed of our vaccination programme will increase each week. ""From Monday, the number of people vaccinated will be published daily and we will publish our vaccination rollout plan early next week."" The figure in Wales means approximately 1.6% of people have been vaccinated up to 3 January - fewer than other UK nations - and the gap appears to be growing compared to last week. In England, nearly 1.1 million people were given the first dose by 3 January. This is about 1.9% of the population. NHS England said 60% of doses have gone to people aged over 80. If vaccinations were being given at the same rate in Wales as in England, a further 13,000 people would have been given a dose. In both Scotland and Northern Ireland, 2.1% of people have been given a first dose.

Q&A: When will I get the Oxford vaccine? Health and care workers get first Covid vaccines Samantha is keen to have the vaccine as soon as possible and return to work Dental nurse Samantha Davies, 47, who has shielded since March, was overjoyed at the prospect of having the coronavirus vaccine and returning to work. But she is now in limbo after confusion over whether she could have the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab because of her ongoing treatment for Crohn's Disease. After filling out a questionnaire sent by PHW, a consultant recommended she should have the Pfizer-BioNTech jab instead. This is because of theinflectra infusion treatment,externalshe receives every eight weeks to treat her Crohn's Disease - a type of inflammatory bowel condition. However, the Pfizer vaccine is in shorter supply than the Oxford vaccine and the Swansea practice where Samantha works was only offered 10 vaccinations. As Samantha, from Foelgastell, Carmarthenshire, is shielding and not in work, she was not considered a priority for one of these. Swansea Bay health board has since said the advice about vaccines was given in error and pledged to arrange an appointment for her as soon as possible. ""It's just being home all the time. Some people I know had it two or three weeks ago. The government put me shielding since March on sick pay and I just want to return to work,"" she said. While she was furloughed from April to August, Samantha has been on statutory sick pay since. Dr Gillian Richardson, the senior officer responsible for the Covid-19 vaccine programme in Wales, said the efforts from NHS Wales and PHW had been ""exceptional"". ""The number of doses unable to be used have been incredibly low - around 1% - and significantly below anticipated levels, thanks to the robust appointment planning and reserve lists,"" she said. ""The NHS is providing vaccines as quickly and as safely as possible to people in the priority groups."" Derek Hinchliffe, 80, says he is ""frustrated"" at not knowing when he will get his first dose of vaccine However, 80-year-old Derek Hinchliffe, who is eligible for a first dose of a Covid vaccine during this period of the rollout, said he was ""frustrated"" because he has had no information about getting the first dose. Mr Hinchliffe, who lives with his wife in Penpedairheol in Caerphilly county, said: ""We've had nothing - no communication. ""We've got friends the same as us who live in England who have had their first dose, and some of them are having their second vaccination."" Allow Twitter content?

Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies renewed his call for a vaccinations minister to be appointed to take control. ""Of course we welcome the increase in the number of vaccinations, but the rough calculation is that one in 65 people in Wales has had their jab compared to one in 50 in England,"" he said, ""Factor in the postcode lottery emerging in Wales, and the picture's not looking great. ""You're twice as likely in south Wales to have had the vaccination and three times more likely to have had it in mid Wales than in north Wales."" Dr Richardson calledthe second Covid vaccine - Oxford-AstraZeneca - which began its roll-out on Mondaya ""real game-changer"". She said it would help speed up vaccinations considerably. There are challenges with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because it has to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, while the Oxford vaccine can be be kept in a fridge. Both vaccines will be available in Wales and the Welsh Government said 40,000 doses of the Oxford jab would be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week. Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection.

Prof Horby said early signs were encouraging that the vaccines would be effective against the new Covid variants - first identified in the UK and in South Africa - and he did not want people to ""hide under the duvet"". ""We can see the end game now,"" he said. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more ""transmissible"", possibly because each infected individual produces more of the actual virus - sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from serious symptoms but we don't yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be needed to bring the R-number below one and start to reduce the overall size of the pandemic. Mass community testing is to be rolled out this week, the government has said, and the health secretary said around two million people had been vaccinated in the UK, with some 200,000 jabs being given in England daily. Mr Hancock said by autumn every adult in the UK would be offered a vaccine. He said the government was on course to reach its target of 15 million people vaccinated by mid-February, with the opening of seven mass vaccination centres this week likely to increase the rate of jabs. Mr Hancock told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he hoped coronavirus could be treated like seasonal flu with an annual vaccination programme in the future. Prof Horby said the vaccines may have to be updated ""every few years"" as the virus mutates and said it was unlikely the virus would go away completely. ""We're going to have to live with it,"" he said. ""But that may change significantly. ""It may well become more of an endemic virus that's with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths but is not causing the huge disruption that we're seeing now.""

"Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they needed to ""act with urgency"" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stepped up the pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to act to remove Donald Trump from office over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Lawmakers are expected to bring up a resolution asking Mr Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit for office. Mr Pence is said to oppose the idea. If he refuses, the House will hold a vote to impeach Mr Trump who had urged supporters to march on the Capitol. The Republican president has been accused by Democrats and an increasing number of fellow Republicans over the riot, following a rally in which Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated allegations of vote fraud. Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol police officer. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he wasbanned from several social media platforms- including Twitter - on Friday. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn is as president. Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony. What is the 25th Amendment? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Ms Pelosi wrote to lawmakers saying the House of Representatives would present a resolution on Monday to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which would allow Mr Pence to remove Mr Trump from the White House and become acting president. The House could vote on the resolution on Tuesday. After that, Mr Pence and the cabinet would be given 24 hours to act before the House's potential move toward impeachment. ""We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent,"" Ms Pelosi said in her letter on Sunday. ""The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action."" Although Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president by saying on Sunday he planned to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment. Meanwhile, a second Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said the president should ""resign and go away as soon as possible"", joining Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ In a separate development, First Lady Melania Trump, who rarely makes public comments about political events, condemned Wednesday's violence,saying the ""nation must heal in a civil manner"".,external ""I implore people to stop the violence, never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin or use differing political ideologies as a basis for aggression and viciousness,"" she said in a statement called Our Path Forward released by the White House. House Democrats have vowed to press ahead quickly with impeachment. To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress, and Ms Pelosi said Democrats could introduce a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" against Mr Trump. Senior lawmakers say a vote to impeach Mr Trump in the House could be held by mid-week. Mr Trump could become the only president in US history to have been impeached twice. Proceedings would then move to the Senate for a trial, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal. If he is convicted, the Senate could also hold a vote to bar Mr Trump from holding public office again. Could Trump be removed from power? The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters However, House whip James Clyburn, another senior Democrat, told CNN the party may not send any impeachment articles to the Senate until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office, saying: ""Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running."" That would allow Mr Biden to confirm his new cabinet and kickstart key policies including tackling coronavirus, something that would have to wait if the Senate had already received the impeachment articles. This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' No Republican senators have said they will vote to convict Mr Trump of wrongdoing. The White House and senior Republicans have dismissed impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"". Mr Biden has said impeachment is for Congress to decide, even though he has thought ""for a long time President Trump was not fit to hold the job"". As investigators try to prosecute rioters who stormed the Capitol, police departments in Virginia and Washington state have placed officers on administrative leave for allegedly attending the events while off-duty. Fire departments in Florida and New York City have also said some of their members may have been present when the mob broke into the Capitol, according to Reuters news agency.

"Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday Bans imposed by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Donald Trump's accounts raise a ""very big question"" about how social media is regulated, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The companies acted after supporters of the US president stormed Washington DC's Capitol building on Wednesday. Mr Hancock said the bans showed they were now ""taking editorial decisions"". Campaigners want social media to be treated as ""publishers"", rather than ""platforms"", meaning more regulation. But opponents of the idea argue that it could allow governments to limit debate. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Trump to take 'big action' against social media More powers for Ofcom to police social media firms Mr Trump faces an impeachment charge, with Democrats accusing the Republican president of encouraging the Washington riots, in which five people died. Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". But Mr Trump called this an attack on free speech and suggested he would look at ""building out our own platform in the future"". There has been a long-running debate over whether social media companies should be treated in law as ""publishers"", with greater responsibility for dealing with libellous, discriminatory, misleading or incendiary content posted by users. Mr Hancock, a former culture secretary, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump - the scenes at the Capitol - were terrible - and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. ""But there's something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That's clear because they're choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice on their platform."" Mr Hancock said that development was likely to have ""consequences"". Asked earlier about Twitter's decision to ban Mr Trump's account, he told Sky News: ""I think it raises a very important question, which is it means that the social media platforms are taking editorial decisions. ""And that is a very big question because then it raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they're regulated."" Twitter's ban on Mr Trump's account followed the increasing use of warning labels on his posts referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the result of the US presidential election. In a blog on Friday, the company said its public interest framework existed ""to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly"". It added: ""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement."" Facebook and Instagram banned Mr Trump ""indefinitely"" on Thursday, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying this sanction would not be lifted until at least 20 January, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the new US president.

"Dorset Police said officers dispersed dozens of demonstrators from the town centre as they attempted to march A video shared online apparently showing a woman being arrested in breach of lockdown for sitting on a bench was ""stage-managed"", police said. Dorset Police believe the video was planned and recorded by anti-lockdown protesters during a demonstration in Bournemouth on Saturday. Three people were arrested for not giving their details so officers could issue fines for breaking Covid rules. The BBC has asked one of the protesters who posted the video to comment. The force said two of those held were later de-arrested when they confirmed their details in police custody and a third was released when his details were verified - all three were then issued fixed penalty notices. Officers also issued at least seven other fines and 10 dispersal notices. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan, from Dorset Police, said: ""We believe this video was planned, stage-managed and recorded by members of the protest group who turned up in multiple areas, several of whom refused to engage or provide their details. ""If people refuse to give their details in such circumstances then it leaves officers with little option, but to arrest until the details are established. Our officers would only arrest as a last resort. ""It was clear that the group was deliberately organising their activities, walking around in twos and then trying to come together in a 'flash mob'-style approach, as they have done previously. This activity went on for a couple of hours."" The force's chief constable James Vaughan earlier said: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" The force said there were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest and found a number of the protesters had ""travelled considerably"" from out of the Dorset area. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant?

"Workers in Madrid clear a hospital entrance of snow Spain is in a race against time to clear roads covered by heavy snow, and get Covid vaccines and food supplies to areas affected by Storm Filomena. Up to 50cm (20 inches) of snow fell on the capital Madrid, one of the worst hit areas, between Friday and Saturday. At least four people died and thousands of travellers were left stranded. Overnight, temperatures plunged to -8C (18F) in parts of Spain, amid warnings by meteorologists that the snow was turning to perilous ice. The unusual cold wave on the Iberian peninsula is expected to last until Thursday. The Spanish government said it had taken extra steps - including police-escorted convoys - to ensure its expected shipment of some 300,000 coronavirus vaccines can be distributed as planned to regional health authorities later on Monday. ""The commitment is to guarantee the supply of health, vaccines and food. Corridors have been opened to deliver the goods,"" Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said on Sunday.

People have skied along the city's main commercial street, Gran VÃ­a, and one man was pictured being pulled through the district of Hortaleza on a sled by five huskies. But other responses to the snow have been more controversial due to concerns about Covid-19. Dozens of young people had a snowball fight in Callao square, for example, and many of them were without facemasks. Nearby, in Puerta del Sol, others celebrated the snow by dancing a conga. The daily Marca newspaper branded it ""the conga of shame"". Although the snowfall has now stopped, low temperatures have left snow and ice piled up across the capital and the surrounding region. And with residents advised to avoid using their cars, public transport has seen a surge in demand. This has compounded coronavirus concerns as many metro train carriages were packed at rush hour on Monday morning, making social distancing impossible. Madrid's international airport began gradually resuming operations on Sunday afternoon, having cancelled all flights on Friday. Some 500 people across the Madrid region were forced to spend the night in temporary shelter, including sports centres, after they were trapped by the whiteout. About 100 shoppers and staff spent two nights at a shopping centre in Majadahonda, a town north of the capital. ""There are people sleeping on the ground on cardboard,"" one restaurant employee told TVE television. Spain's Meteorological Agency said Saturday's snowfall was the heaviest in Madrid since 1971 But there were stories of heroism too, including doctors and medical workers who abandoned their cars and walked for hours to get to work. One doctor, Alvaro Sanchez, said on social media he had walked 17km (10 miles) over nearly two hours to get to work, while two nurses, Paco and Monica, said they had walked 22km to their hospital. They were praised by Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa, who tweeted: ""The commitment that the entire group of health workers is showing is an example of solidarity and dedication."" Some 4x4 vehicle owners offered to transport medical workers, while other volunteers helped to clear hospital entrance ways. ""Health staff have been working (hard) for more than a year and this is just a short moment for us, so as citizens, we are trying to help; it is everyone's responsibility,"" said Fernando de la Fuente, 60, who helped clear the entrance to Madrid's Gregorio Maranon Hospital.

"Sarah and her husband Gary lived in the caravan on the drive for nine months A nurse who lived in a caravan for nine months to protect her mother from coronavirus says moving back into her house was like ""winning the lottery"". Sarah Link and her husband Gary, who usually share a home with her mother, bought the caravan in March to allow them to isolate. ""I have cried a river in the caravan, if it wasn't for Gary, I wouldn't have got through it,"" Mrs Link said. They moved back home for Christmas after her mother received the vaccine. The caravan, bought for Â£600 and parked on their own drive in Cradley, in the Black Country, allowed Mrs Link to continue working at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital and her husband at his fishmonger's business. ""I'd do it again tomorrow. I would do it every time, I would have done anything to protect mum,"" she said. ""We were thinking it would be four weeks, 12 weeks max, then the summer came and went and nine months later we were still there. It was incredible, I just can't believe we did it,"" Mrs Link, who has been a nurse for 17 years, said. The couple both contracted coronavirus in December, but carried on living in the caravan so they could self-isolate and continue to protect Mrs Link's 84-year-old mother. Mrs Link said her Christmas this year was ""magical"" after moving out of the caravan ""I went back to work properly last week. I still get tired easily and suffer with fatigue, but I'm OK,"" Mrs Link said. ""It's getting ridiculous the cases... some people still walk around and don't believe it's real. If people came on my ward and see what I've seen."" 'I moved out because my kids returned to school' Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died Grow up and take Covid seriously: Doctor Mrs Link said she had not hugged her mother since before March as they were still taking precautions to keep her safe. She said Christmas and new year had been ""magical"" adding it was the ""best"" she had ever experienced after being able to move back home. ""We all cried when it turned midnight, that year we'd all had. ""It was like winning the lottery, waking up in a proper bed. ""We're in the warm...

"Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday Bans imposed by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Donald Trump's accounts raise a ""very big question"" about how social media is regulated, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The companies acted after supporters of the US president stormed Washington DC's Capitol building on Wednesday. Mr Hancock said the bans showed they were now ""taking editorial decisions"". Campaigners want social media to be treated as ""publishers"", rather than ""platforms"", meaning more regulation. But opponents of the idea argue that it could allow governments to limit debate. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Trump to take 'big action' against social media More powers for Ofcom to police social media firms Mr Trump faces an impeachment charge, with Democrats accusing the Republican president of encouraging the Washington riots, in which five people died. Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". But Mr Trump called this an attack on free speech and suggested he would look at ""building out our own platform in the future"". There has been a long-running debate over whether social media companies should be treated in law as ""publishers"", with greater responsibility for dealing with libellous, discriminatory, misleading or incendiary content posted by users. Mr Hancock, a former culture secretary, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump - the scenes at the Capitol - were terrible - and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. ""But there's something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That's clear because they're choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice on their platform."" Mr Hancock said that development was likely to have ""consequences"". Asked earlier about Twitter's decision to ban Mr Trump's account, he told Sky News: ""I think it raises a very important question, which is it means that the social media platforms are taking editorial decisions. ""And that is a very big question because then it raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they're regulated."" Twitter's ban on Mr Trump's account followed the increasing use of warning labels on his posts referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the result of the US presidential election. In a blog on Friday, the company said its public interest framework existed ""to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly"". It added: ""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement."" Facebook and Instagram banned Mr Trump ""indefinitely"" on Thursday, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying this sanction would not be lifted until at least 20 January, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the new US president.

Seeing the keeper make the saves and still be in the shootout was quite frustrating. But that can happen in the FA Cup and this is a difficult, unique place to come. Anything can happen and it probably did. ""Jason Steele is honest and supportive of the team. I'm delighted for him in how he's contributed to us going through. ""I didn't expect anything else [but a hard game] on a really difficult playing surface. It makes it hard to find real quality. The way Newport played they were always in the game.

All square again... Ryan Taylor Top corner - and for the first time in the shootout - and in the tie - the League Two side have their noses in front.

"An ambulance had to be lifted out of the mud Rescuers searching for victims of a landslide in Indonesia were buried by a second mudslide just hours later, officials say. The first landslide, in Cihanjuang village, West Java, was triggered by torrential rain. Another struck as survivors were still being evacuated. At least 12 people died and dozens more are missing. Landslides are common in Indonesia during rainy season, and often blamed on deforestation. The latest disasters hit the villagers in Sumedang regency, about 150km (95 miles) southeast of the capital Jakarta, three and a half hours apart on Saturday. The first happened at 16:00 (09:00 GMT) and the second at 19:30 (12:30 GMT), disaster agency spokesman Raditya Jati said in a statement. ""The first landslide was triggered by high rainfall and unstable soil conditions. The subsequent landslide occurred while officers were still evacuating victims around the first landslide area,"" he added. Rescuers are believed to be among those killed, he added. A six-year-old boy was also among the dead, according to AFP news agency. Some 27 people were believed to be missing late on Sunday, local media quoted Deden Ridwansah, the head of the local search and rescue agency as saying. About 46 were known to have survived. Bad weather had forced the search to be suspended, he said, but it was expected to resume on Monday. Indonesia frequently suffers floods and landslides.

"Dorset Police said officers dispersed dozens of demonstrators from the town centre as they attempted to march A video shared online apparently showing a woman being arrested in breach of lockdown for sitting on a bench was ""stage-managed"", police said. Dorset Police believe the video was planned and recorded by anti-lockdown protesters during a demonstration in Bournemouth on Saturday. Three people were arrested for not giving their details so officers could issue fines for breaking Covid rules. The BBC has asked one of the protesters who posted the video to comment. The force said two of those held were later de-arrested when they confirmed their details in police custody and a third was released when his details were verified - all three were then issued fixed penalty notices. Officers also issued at least seven other fines and 10 dispersal notices. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan, from Dorset Police, said: ""We believe this video was planned, stage-managed and recorded by members of the protest group who turned up in multiple areas, several of whom refused to engage or provide their details. ""If people refuse to give their details in such circumstances then it leaves officers with little option, but to arrest until the details are established. Our officers would only arrest as a last resort. ""It was clear that the group was deliberately organising their activities, walking around in twos and then trying to come together in a 'flash mob'-style approach, as they have done previously. This activity went on for a couple of hours."" The force's chief constable James Vaughan earlier said: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" The force said there were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest and found a number of the protesters had ""travelled considerably"" from out of the Dorset area. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? Sam Crowe, director of public health for Dorset, said its hospital services were ""close to being overwhelmed"". Mr Crowe said: ""Infection rates locally have been doubling in less than a week.

"NI's six health trusts have warned that by the third week of January, NI hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients. In ajoint statement,external, the trust chief executives said the figures were based on modelling projections. They also said there were staffing concerns at a time when there are increased numbers of patients. Earlier on Sunday night, the Western Health Trust issued an appeal to off-duty staff. It called for any staff near South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to either contact the trust or go to the hospital. The hospital has additional beds and the staff were wanted so it could help out the Southern Health Trust, which was under severe pressure at Craigavon Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital. The Western Trust has since said it was ""overwhelmed by the offers of help and support from"" staff and that the situation has now stabilised.

It's about 700 people. ""At the peak of the first surge there were 400 people in hospital so already we're in a very grave situation."" On Sunday there were 703 people in hospital with the virus, 53 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 34 being ventilated.

Earlier, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to ""voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks"". In the joint statement, trust executives urged the public to ""stay at home, practise social distancing, hand hygiene and wear face coverings."" In December they warned""several of NI's acute hospitals were operating beyond capacity"". In their latest statement, the trusts said dealing with the pandemic was now ""not a simple matter of putting up more beds."" The statement said: ""We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. ""Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren't there."" Seventeen more coronavirus-related deaths have been reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. It takes its death toll to 1,460. Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal' Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery In their statement, the trusts made reference to thestanding down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery. ""This was to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both Covid and non-Covid patients needing ICU care,"" they said. The trusts said the postponed operations would be rescheduled as soon as possible. They added that patients who did undergo surgery may need to travel further for it. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options. They said that staff ""although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it."" However, the chief executives added that it would not be easy and the ""care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best."" In December some patients had to be treated in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital The trusts also warned the public that no-one should be attending a hospital emergency department at any time unless they need emergency care and said longer waits were likely They added that patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. ""This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to life threatening emergencies in the community,"" the statement said. The trusts said the vaccines rollout ""provides the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge."" The Health Department anticipates the vaccination programme will continue until the summer of 2021. New lockdownrestrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. In the Republic of Ireland the Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday, bringing its death toll to 2,344. It said there are 6,888 new cases and 125 people are in ICU. Earlier this week, the reproductive rate of the virus in Northern Ireland - known as the R-number - was sitting at about 1.8.

It added that it no longer anticipated patients being diverted from Craigavon or Daisy Hill to SWAH. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's about 700 people. ""At the peak of the first surge there were 400 people in hospital so already we're in a very grave situation."" On Sunday there were 703 people in hospital with the virus, 53 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 34 being ventilated. Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said staff were working ""above their contracted obligations, are overworked and overtired"". She added that any attempt to force them to cancel annual leave would be ""inhumane"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to ""voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks"". In the joint statement, trust executives urged the public to ""stay at home, practise social distancing, hand hygiene and wear face coverings."" In December they warned""several of NI's acute hospitals were operating beyond capacity"". In their latest statement, the trusts said dealing with the pandemic was now ""not a simple matter of putting up more beds."" The statement said: ""We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. ""Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren't there."" Seventeen more coronavirus-related deaths have been reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. It takes its death toll to 1,460. Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal' Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery In their statement, the trusts made reference to thestanding down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery. ""This was to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both Covid and non-Covid patients needing ICU care,"" they said. The trusts said the postponed operations would be rescheduled as soon as possible. They added that patients who did undergo surgery may need to travel further for it. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options. They said that staff ""although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it."" However, the chief executives added that it would not be easy and the ""care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best."" In December some patients had to be treated in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital The trusts also warned the public that no-one should be attending a hospital emergency department at any time unless they need emergency care and said longer waits were likely They added that patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. ""This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to life threatening emergencies in the community,"" the statement said. The trusts said the vaccines rollout ""provides the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge."" The Health Department anticipates the vaccination programme will continue until the summer of 2021. New lockdownrestrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. In the Republic of Ireland the Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday, bringing its death toll to 2,344. It said there are 6,888 new cases and 125 people are in ICU. Earlier this week, the reproductive rate of the virus in Northern Ireland - known as the R-number - was sitting at about 1.8.

"Dorset Police said officers dispersed dozens of demonstrators from the town centre as they attempted to march A video shared online apparently showing a woman being arrested in breach of lockdown for sitting on a bench was ""stage-managed"", police said. Dorset Police believe the video was planned and recorded by anti-lockdown protesters during a demonstration in Bournemouth on Saturday. Three people were arrested for not giving their details so officers could issue fines for breaking Covid rules. The BBC has asked one of the protesters who posted the video to comment. The force said two of those held were later de-arrested when they confirmed their details in police custody and a third was released when his details were verified - all three were then issued fixed penalty notices. Officers also issued at least seven other fines and 10 dispersal notices. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan, from Dorset Police, said: ""We believe this video was planned, stage-managed and recorded by members of the protest group who turned up in multiple areas, several of whom refused to engage or provide their details. ""If people refuse to give their details in such circumstances then it leaves officers with little option, but to arrest until the details are established. Our officers would only arrest as a last resort. ""It was clear that the group was deliberately organising their activities, walking around in twos and then trying to come together in a 'flash mob'-style approach, as they have done previously. This activity went on for a couple of hours."" The force's chief constable James Vaughan earlier said: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" The force said there were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest and found a number of the protesters had ""travelled considerably"" from out of the Dorset area. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? Sam Crowe, director of public health for Dorset, said its hospital services were ""close to being overwhelmed"". Mr Crowe said: ""Infection rates locally have been doubling in less than a week. If this carries on, our hospitals will not be able to cope with caring for those needing life-saving treatment. Stay at home means exactly that.""

"Flat owners applying to a fund to help pay to remove flammable building cladding will be told not to talk to the press without government approval. A draft agreement, uncovered by the Sunday Times, says that even where there is ""overwhelming public interest"" in speaking to journalists, the government must be told first. The government said the wording was ""standard"". It set up a Â£1.6bn fund last year to repair the most dangerous buildings. But it warned that the fund might not cover all the costs of removing the cladding. The clause might affect building owners and professional managing agents but also residents who manage their building. Some types of the covering, often added to newer blocks of flats, have been proven to be a fire hazard. After the 2017 Grenfell fire, the government pledged that safe alternatives to dangerous cladding would be provided on all buildings in England taller than 18m. It set up the Â£1.6bn fund to help foot the costs. 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Cladding red tape 'stops people selling homes' The agreement, between the building owner or leaseholder and the government, says: ""The Applicant shall not make any communication to the press or any journalist or broadcaster regarding the Project or the Agreement (or the performance of it by any Party) without the prior written approval of Homes England and [the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government ]"" and its press offices. It says an exception can be made ""where such disclosure is in the overwhelming public interest (in which case disclosure will not be made without first allowing Homes England and MHCLG to make representations on such proposed disclosure)."" TheUK Cladding Action Group,externaltweeted that it was ""clearly a matter of public interest"" that these issues were aired in public. ""No department should be hiding behind non-disclosure agreements to stop scrutiny of their actions,"" the group said. 'Institutional failure' Another campaign group, Manchester Cladiators, said the existence of the ""gagging clause"" was ""shocking but not necessarily that surprising"". Spokesperson Rebecca Fairclough said residents would feel ""intimidated"" by it, adding: ""We ask the government to remove this unfair clause immediately and focus on the priority of solving this institutional failure, which still exists and is only growing over three and a half years after the Grenfell tragedy."" The government insists that the wording in the agreement, under the heading ""Marketing material"", is there to ensure applicants come to the government first. ""The terms set out are standard in commercial agreements and are not specific to this fund - to suggest otherwise is misleading and inaccurate,"" the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said in a statement. ""We want a constructive working relationship with building owners who apply to the fund and applicants are asked to work with the department on public communications relating to the project.""

"NI's six health trusts have warned that by the third week of January, NI hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients. In ajoint statement,external, the trust chief executives said the figures were based on modelling projections. They also said there were staffing concerns at a time when there are increased numbers of patients. Earlier on Sunday night, the Western Health Trust issued an appeal to off-duty staff. It called for any staff near South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to either contact the trust or go to the hospital. The hospital has additional beds and the staff were wanted so it could help out the Southern Health Trust, which was under severe pressure at Craigavon Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital. The Western Trust has since said it was ""overwhelmed by the offers of help and support from"" staff and that the situation has now stabilised.

Anything can happen and it probably did. ""Jason Steele is honest and supportive of the team. I'm delighted for him in how he's contributed to us going through. ""I didn't expect anything else [but a hard game] on a really difficult playing surface. It makes it hard to find real quality. The way Newport played they were always in the game.

"Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live about 30 to 45 minutes' drive away from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. The seven centres include Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, London's Nightingale hospital, Newcastle's Centre for Life, the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre, Robertson House in Stevenage and Birmingham's Millennium Point. People will not miss out on their vaccination if they do not use the letters to make an appointment at one of the centres, the NHS said. Two Labour MPs tweeted about their concerns about the letters being delayed in getting out to people due to coronavirus affecting Royal Mail staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mary McGarry from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire told BBC News that her letter points to an NHS online booking page which suggests she would have to take her husband, who has cancer and a lung disease, 20 miles to Birmingham. ""We're very reluctant to go into Birmingham city centre,"" she said. ""If we can't get somebody to take us, we'd have to go on the train but we're shielding because my husband's got poor health.... we want to know why we've got to travel that far?"" Kay Hayward, from Whitwick in Leicestershire, said she went online to book an appointment for her 85-year-old husband Kenneth and was offered five different places including Widnes in Cheshire and Stevenage in Hertfordshire. ""I thought they must be joking... we talked about it and we thought it was actually safer to stay here and for him not not have it. 130,000 letters have been sent out by NHS England so far ""But we were worried if we turned this down, we'd be off the list.. the letter doesn't say anything about having the vaccines anywhere else locally."" Andrea Eaton, from Coventry, said she was so angry that her 81-year-old mother, who has heart problems and leukaemia, was offered Birmingham for her appointment that she attempted to ring Downing Street on Saturday night to complain. She said she reached the press office and said: ""I want you to give Boris a message please that he has lied to the British public. ""He has told themthey never need to go more than 10 miles... they were really rude and just put the phone down on me."" Andrea Eaton said she wanted to get a message to Boris Johnson so rang Downing Street on Saturday evening A spokesperson from Number 10 told BBC News that they did not wish to comment, but wanted to remind the public to use the government website to write to the prime minister or contact their constituency MP. Councillor Shaun Davies, the Labour leader at Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said he had been contacted by dozens of people who have found the letters misleading, thinking this is their only chance to get the vaccine. He said he had spoken to Trafford Council and was aware of people in Shropshire being sent to Manchester and residents there being directed to Birmingham to get their jabs. ""For many people they have been told consistently to wait for the NHS to contact you in order to get a vaccine and that's what they've had for the first time as a piece of communication. ""This is really, really concerning for people in their 80s or 90s because of the importance of getting the vaccine."" The letters are not ""going to the heart"" of the public health message which is staying home and staying local, he said. More than 500,000 letters will be sent out to homes offering people appointments at the centres over the next seven days Dr Sarah Raistrick, from Coventry and Rugby Clinical Commission group (CCG), said people did not have to travel to the centres but admitted the letter did not make that clear. ""You can wait and be contacted by your local GP service and have it locally if you'd prefer. ""If you sit tight, you will be contacted and I'm hopeful that if you're 80 or over, by the end of this month you will have had your vaccination whether that is locally or whether you have chosen to travel,"" she said. Work will be done with the NHS locally and nationally to make that message clearer, she added. The seven centres were chosen to give a geographical spread covering as many people as possible and are capable of delivering thousands of jabs per week, NHS England has said. BBC News has contacted NHS England for a response. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"Home Secretary Priti Patel has said officers ""will not hesitate"" to enforce lockdown rules as she defended the way police have handled breaches. She said rising numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths illustrated the need for ""strong enforcement"". It comes after the National Police Chiefs' Council published guidance saying officers should issue fines more quickly when rules are broken. More than 30,000 fines have been handed out by forces in England and Wales. NPCC figures show 32,329 fixed penalty notices were issued between 27 March and 21 December last year. Covid testing for asymptomatic workers expanded What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The number of people who have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid testsurpassed 80,000on Saturday, and a further 59,937 people tested positive. Ministers have launched a new campaign urging people toact like they have the virusand scientists have warned that lockdown measures in England need to be stricter. ""The vast majority of the public have supported this huge national effort and followed the rules,"" Ms Patel said. ""But the tragic number of new cases and deaths this week shows there is still a need for strong enforcement where people are clearly breaking these rules to ensure we safeguard our country's recovery from this deadly virus. ""Enforcing these rules saves lives. It is as simple as that. Officers will continue to engage with the public across the country and will not hesitate to take action when necessary."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned the public to follow the lockdown restrictions, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""every time you try to flex the rules, that could be fatal"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government for not providing ""absolute clarity of messaging"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr that there had been ""mixed messaging over the last nine months"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters NPCC guidance, published on 6 January, says officers should still offer people ""encouragement"" to comply with the regulations and explain any changes. ""However, if the individual or group does not respond appropriately, then enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" the NPCC said. Covid fine review welcomed by 'intimidated' women Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip Warnings 'blatantly ignored' as cars turned away On Saturday12 people were arrested during an anti-lockdown protestin south London. Elsewhere, North Wales Policeturned away more than 100 carsat Moel Famau in Flintshire by Saturday lunchtime, and Norfolk Police fined one couple who had travelled about 130 miles (209km) to see a seal colony. However, Derbyshire Police has launched an urgent review into how fines were issued after two women were charged Â£200 each. The pair were stopped by officers for walking five miles from their home with hot drinks, which they were told were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". John Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said officers were under ""immense pressure to do the right thing"" and said with ""such a changing landscape politically and legally"" there were going to be things which did not go right. He said the police had to balance the relationship with the public. ""It's not easy because all we are trying to do in policing is keep as many people safe as possible,"" he said.

Staff sickness and self-isolation means some food producers are cutting the number of product lines they offer. While customers might not get their exact product choice, plenty of food should be available, Ocado said. ""Staff absences across the supply chain may lead to an increase in product substitutions for a small number of customers as some suppliers consolidate their offering to maintain output,"" a spokesperson said. Food waste: 'I'll have to throw away Â£6,000-worth of milk' The news comes after a rush of online food orders for supermarkets, as shoppers try to stay at home after the new lockdown started. Within a couple of hours of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Monday, shoppers reported problems with Sainsbury's and Tesco, while Ocado customers were placed in a virtual queue. Ocado told its customers that from Friday ""changes to the UK supply chain have affected some of our suppliers and may result in an increase of missing items and substitutions over the next few weeks."" It added: ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused and we are working hard to mitigate any impact."" Food suppliers are grappling with staffing problems, hospitality clients who have closed their doors and delays at the border with the EU. Wholesalers the BBC spoke to this week said they facedthrowing away thousands of pounds worth of foodbecause of cancelled orders following new restrictions. The UK meat industry has called for the early vaccination of its workers to keep food supplies running smoothly during the coronavirus crisis. It warned earlier this week that absences during the pandemic, coupled with disruption at ports, could hit food supply chains. An early vaccination call for supermarket staff was also made by the boss of Sainsbury's on Thursday. The government said the food industry remains ""well-prepared"" to make sure people have the food they need. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said coronavirus and disruption at ports due to new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period were ""a severe challenge to the industry and to the smooth running of the nation's food supply chain"".

"This video can not be played Asymptomatic testing for Covid can help ""break the chains of transmission"", Matt Hancock says Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week, the government has said. The community testing regime - expanded to cover all 317 local authorities - uses rapid lateral flow tests, which can return results in 30 minutes. Local councils are being encouraged to prioritise tests for those who cannot work from home during the lockdown. The health secretary said asymptomatic testing can help break transmission. Meanwhile, NHS England has invited tens of thousands of people over 80 to book vaccinations. Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warn Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 54,940 cases reported, according to government figures on Sunday. The total number of deaths in the UK after a positive testpassed 80,000 on Saturday. The governmenthas launched a campaigntelling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Department of Health and Social Care said expanding the Community Testing Programme to more people without symptoms was ""crucial given that around one in three people"" who contract Covid-19 show no symptoms. It said regular community testing using the rapid tests had already identified more than 14,800 positive Covid-19 cases. So far, 131 local authorities in England have enrolled in the government's community testing programme, with Milton Keynes, Slough, Doncaster and Essex the latest to join. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said targeted asymptomatic testing and subsequent isolation was ""highly effective in breaking chains of transmission"". But Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol Medical School, said increasing lateral flow testing was ""very worrying"" and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases ""will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests"". Defending lateral flow tests on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Mr Hancock said mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool had seen the case rate drop ""more sharply than it did in other similar areas where only restrictions were brought in"". NHS Test and Trace will also work closely with other government departments to scale up workforce testing, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Many are already piloting regular workforce testing, with 15 large employers having taken up this offer already across 64 sites, ""including organisations operating in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks and the military"". The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place for rapid testing of staff and students in schools and colleges and staff in primary schools. Asked when schools could reopen by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Hancock said there were four conditions: that there is not a major new variant, the vaccine rollout is proceeding effectively, the number of deaths is falling and there is an easing of pressure on the NHS. Businesses have welcomed asymptomatic testing. Matthew Fell, of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said: ""This expansion of testing will help more critical workers and those unable to work from home to operate safely, while also catching new cases more swiftly."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the safety of the workforce had been an ""absolute priority"" and said the expansion of testing means ""we can keep our economy on the move while giving individuals in key sectors complete confidence that their workplace is safe"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters But Prof Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, told BBC Breakfast the country would continue a ""yo-yoing of lockdown"" without a ""test, trace and isolate system that actually works"" and warned there needed to be tighter restrictions and tougher messaging than in March to prevent ""tens of thousands of avoidable deaths in the next few weeks"". In other developments: Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises the government,has said people must take lockdown seriouslyas ""we are now in the eye of a storm"" Two million people have been inoculated so far, Mr Hancock has said, adding that the government is on course to reach its target of 13 million people vaccinated by mid-February British Medical Association chairman Chaand Nagpaul revealed that more than 46,000 hospital staff are off sick with Covid-19, which is beginning to affect the vaccination programme,the Observer reports,external London Mayor Sadiq Khan has welcomed the opening of a vaccination centre at the ExCel Centre in east London next week - which he said would be crucial in helping to accelerate the rollout of the vaccine The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be availablein more than 1,000 locations in Scotland from Monday, the nation's government has said Buckingham Palace saidthe Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, received Covid-19 vaccinations on Saturday- they are among about 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far THE JOE WICKS PODCAST:Joe asks some of his inspiring mates about their secret to physical and mental happiness THE CIPHER:A new thriller from BBC Sounds.

"The number of patients in intensive care with Covid has risen sharply, amid warnings that tougher lockdown measures may be needed. Latest Scottish government figures show 1,877 new cases of Covid were reported in the last 24 hours The number of people in intensive care has risen from 109 to 123, the highest daily jump since October. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said a tightening of restrictions could not be ruled out. A total of 1,598 people are currently in hospital with recently-confirmed Covid, up from Saturday's figure of 1,596 patients which was the highest number since the outbreak began. The daily test positivity rate was10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. Oxford vaccine to be rolled out from Monday Tesco staff 'devastated' at deaths of two colleagues Where will I get my vaccine? The deputy first minister said the country was facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus. Speaking on Politics Scotland, Mr Swinney said coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" and he would not rule out tougher lockdown measures. He said: ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" There have been some encouraging signs in recent days with average positivity rates falling, a possible indicator that the lockdown is having an impact, but  Prof Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University, urged caution. She said: ""The numbers are not reducing at the rate which we want them to, so [it is] still a very fragile situation. ""The measures we have now I hope are working but it's not clear whether they are tough enough. ""I think the key change the government could make is in the sectors which are still open, particularly workplaces but also things like takeaways and click and collect."" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government is ""open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary"" Professional sport, along with manufacturing and construction work have been allowed to continue in this lockdown, whereas they were not in the first wave in March. The deputy first minister said the meeting of the cabinet which agreed the latest lockdown saw ministers wondering if they had gone far enough to stop the spread. Mr Swinney added: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" A total of three deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours but these figures are lower at weekends because register offices are generally closed. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Live-streamed lessons will not be offered to all children in Scotland when the new school terms begins on Monday, according to BBC research. Plans for remote learning during the latest lockdown reveal big disparities between Scotland's 32 councils. Many say live online lessons will be part of a mix of different learning tools offered to pupils but some have ruled it out. The Scottish government said a uniform approach would be ""counterproductive"". Instead the decision on the best approach has been left to individual schools and teachers. The BBC news website asked all of Scotland's councils about their plans for digital teaching. The replies also revealed a varying approach over how some vulnerable and children of key workers who are able to attend school will be taught. Some will receive face-to-face teaching while others will be supervised by school staff while they complete the remote learning tasks set by their class teachers. Scots ordered to stay home in new Covid lockdown Local authorities said schools were better prepared to roll out digital learning than they were during the first lockdown. And they argued that head teachers were best placed to know the most effective methods to deliver home learning to their pupils. But one parents' group has raised concerns about ""equal and fair access to home learning"" and it has called on the Scottish government to set minimum standards. Education Secretary John Swinney saidnew guidance on remote learning published by Education Scotland,externalhighlights the importance of ""an appropriate balance of live learning and independent activity and an entitlement to ongoing dialogue, reflection and feedback with teachers"". Speaking to Politics Scotland, Mr Swinney said: ""There's been a huge amount of work done by educators the length and breadth of the country to prepare for remote learning. ""This work started back in March of 2020. ""It would be completely impossible, and actually counterproductive, for the government to issue a national programme. ""I'm very confident that good measures have been put in place and I look forward to pupils being supported in their homes. "" The education secretary says much preparation has been made since home learning of the first lockdown Most Scottish councils said live lessons would be part of a ""mix"" which would also involve recorded sessions and independent study for pupils. Orkney, which cited poor connectivity, and Midlothian said they had no plans for live lessons this week, although one teacher in Orkney contacted us to say he would be delivering live online teaching for the majority of his pupils. Midlothian later said that at least one school was offering live lessons from Monday and more schools would follow suit in the coming days. Others, such as Dundee and Renfrewshire, were among those who said it was being worked out on a school-by-school basis. West Lothian said there was ""potential"" for live lessons but individual staff would decide the most appropriate method of delivery. Aberdeenshire said the remote tools it used, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom, had the ""option"" of video conferencing tools but it did not say whether schools would use them. Glasgow said live video lessons would be part of the mix in secondary schools, while East Renfrewshire said schools would be using a range of different methods which ""might"" include live lessons. Meanwhile, Edinburgh said ""school work and recorded lessons will be uploaded online so that all pupils can access them during the course of the school day/week"". It said some live lessons may also be available but daily video conference classes from teachers will not be the norm. South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway said schools were still finalising details on how remote learning would work. Lindsay Paterson, a professor of education policy at the University of Edinburgh, said the disparities ""confirm the sense that very little work has been done to prepare for this new situation"". He said remote working could only work if schools were actively contacting each pupil - preferably every day and by phone rather than text or email. Pupils should be regularly given work to submit to the teacher either electronically or by post, and the work should be marked and returned with feedback, he added. Prof Paterson said this would keep pupils engaged but only about half of school pupils had that experience during the 2020 lockdown. The 50/50 In School campaign has been calling for a national strategy or plan on home learning since June. ""We believe that there should be minimum standards that all schools are delivering in terms of real teacher and class contact as well as interactive lessons,"" said their spokeswoman Janis McCulloch. ""In our opinion this is more than simply putting worksheets on to the Microsoft Teams App."" Ms McCulloch said it was ""disappointing"" to be in another lockdown and feeling no further forward than last March. ""This puts huge pressure on the teaching staff and enormous pressure on parents at home who have to balance working and home learning,"" she said. However Tam Baillie, Scotland's former children's commissioner, said he was not surprised there was a mixture of approaches from councils, schools and teachers. He said they would know what would work best for their local children and young people. ""We shouldn't underestimate the efforts that people have gone to to make this happen,"" he said. Giving evidence to Holyrood's Covid-19 committee on Friday, the education secretary said children and young people should take part in live lessons as well as independent learning. Education Secretary John Swinney said the government had published guidance Mr Swinney pointed to programmes which will be available on BBC television and the e-Sgoil digital platform, which provides resources and live lessons. ""Fundamentally the direction of the remote learning will be undertaken by individual schools, individual teachers relating directly to their pupils,"" he said. ""They will know where their pupils are in the curriculum, they will know what stage they are at, they will know what is the relevant learning to be taken forward and all of that material will be able to be undertaken under the umbrella of remote learning, which will involve live learning."" Mr Swinney said the government had invested heavily in devices such as laptops for pupils who would not otherwise have access to digital learning. More than 50,000 devices have been distributed so far and that number is expected to rise to 70,000. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Scots ordered to stay home in new Covid lockdown Local authorities said schools were better prepared to roll out digital learning than they were during the first lockdown. And they argued that head teachers were best placed to know the most effective methods to deliver home learning to their pupils. But one parents' group has raised concerns about ""equal and fair access to home learning"" and it has called on the Scottish government to set minimum standards. Education Secretary John Swinney saidnew guidance on remote learning published by Education Scotland,externalhighlights the importance of ""an appropriate balance of live learning and independent activity and an entitlement to ongoing dialogue, reflection and feedback with teachers"". Speaking to Politics Scotland, Mr Swinney said: ""There's been a huge amount of work done by educators the length and breadth of the country to prepare for remote learning. ""This work started back in March of 2020. ""It would be completely impossible, and actually counterproductive, for the government to issue a national programme. ""I'm very confident that good measures have been put in place and I look forward to pupils being supported in their homes. "" The education secretary says much preparation has been made since home learning of the first lockdown Most Scottish councils said live lessons would be part of a ""mix"" which would also involve recorded sessions and independent study for pupils. Orkney, which cited poor connectivity, and Midlothian said they had no plans for live lessons this week, although one teacher in Orkney contacted us to say he would be delivering live online teaching for the majority of his pupils. Midlothian later said that at least one school was offering live lessons from Monday and more schools would follow suit in the coming days. Others, such as Dundee and Renfrewshire, were among those who said it was being worked out on a school-by-school basis. West Lothian said there was ""potential"" for live lessons but individual staff would decide the most appropriate method of delivery. Aberdeenshire said the remote tools it used, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom, had the ""option"" of video conferencing tools but it did not say whether schools would use them. Glasgow said live video lessons would be part of the mix in secondary schools, while East Renfrewshire said schools would be using a range of different methods which ""might"" include live lessons. Meanwhile, Edinburgh said ""school work and recorded lessons will be uploaded online so that all pupils can access them during the course of the school day/week"". It said some live lessons may also be available but daily video conference classes from teachers will not be the norm. South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway said schools were still finalising details on how remote learning would work. Lindsay Paterson, a professor of education policy at the University of Edinburgh, said the disparities ""confirm the sense that very little work has been done to prepare for this new situation"". He said remote working could only work if schools were actively contacting each pupil - preferably every day and by phone rather than text or email. Pupils should be regularly given work to submit to the teacher either electronically or by post, and the work should be marked and returned with feedback, he added. Prof Paterson said this would keep pupils engaged but only about half of school pupils had that experience during the 2020 lockdown. The 50/50 In School campaign has been calling for a national strategy or plan on home learning since June. ""We believe that there should be minimum standards that all schools are delivering in terms of real teacher and class contact as well as interactive lessons,"" said their spokeswoman Janis McCulloch. ""In our opinion this is more than simply putting worksheets on to the Microsoft Teams App."" Ms McCulloch said it was ""disappointing"" to be in another lockdown and feeling no further forward than last March. ""This puts huge pressure on the teaching staff and enormous pressure on parents at home who have to balance working and home learning,"" she said. However Tam Baillie, Scotland's former children's commissioner, said he was not surprised there was a mixture of approaches from councils, schools and teachers. He said they would know what would work best for their local children and young people. ""We shouldn't underestimate the efforts that people have gone to to make this happen,"" he said. Giving evidence to Holyrood's Covid-19 committee on Friday, the education secretary said children and young people should take part in live lessons as well as independent learning. Education Secretary John Swinney said the government had published guidance Mr Swinney pointed to programmes which will be available on BBC television and the e-Sgoil digital platform, which provides resources and live lessons. ""Fundamentally the direction of the remote learning will be undertaken by individual schools, individual teachers relating directly to their pupils,"" he said. ""They will know where their pupils are in the curriculum, they will know what stage they are at, they will know what is the relevant learning to be taken forward and all of that material will be able to be undertaken under the umbrella of remote learning, which will involve live learning."" Mr Swinney said the government had invested heavily in devices such as laptops for pupils who would not otherwise have access to digital learning. More than 50,000 devices have been distributed so far and that number is expected to rise to 70,000. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Every adult will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by autumn, Matt Hancock says But right now, people must follow lockdown guidance and stay at home, the health secretary says, as the situation for the NHS is 'very serious' A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were 54,940 new cases reported on Sunday Regular, rapid tests for people without symptoms of Covid-19 will be made available across England from this week Local authorities will be encouraged to target testing to people who cannot work from home during lockdown Global deaths from Covid-19 now stand at 1,928,136, and total cases have reached 89,718,548, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Claire Heald We're going to be wrapping up the live page shortly so here's a reminder of some of the stories we've covered today:  Many thanks for joining us today. Updates were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce and Penny Spiller.  Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey asked of them was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live between a 30 to 45-minute drive from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. Read more here. The government'sSelf Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)was set up to provide financial support to self-employed people who have lost income because of the pandemic. But campaigners say as many as three million self-employed people are not eligible for support. One of those is Cheryl Jones, who served in the Army before retiring to set up her own pet-sitting business. She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that she had not received any financial support from the government since the start of the pandemic when her business closed down. She receives a pension of just over Â£10,000 from the Army and the income from her business was just under Â£10,000. But to be eligible for the SEISS an individual must earn at least 50% of their total income from self-employment. Cheryl said she felt ""let down"" by the government, after being excluded from the scheme. âI am really proud that I served my country and I have
felt disillusioned, depressedâ¦ let down by the government, the country that I
served,"" she said. âI canât even sleep at night, I cry all the time and Iâm
not like that. I am a proud person but this has completely floored me.â The first few weeks of the new year are often when beleaguered couples decide enough is enough and start divorce proceedings. But relationship expert Emma Kenny has warned that this may not be the year to follow that pattern - it could be that weâre projecting our anxieties and frustrations around the coronavirus pandemic on to our partners. Speaking on Mornings, she says: âWe all [project] when weâre in a bad mood; we see our partner and we think that the reason weâre in a bad mood is because of everything they do, as opposed to the way that we feel.â Emma believes we should be wary of contemplating divorce at this moment in time and should view the pandemic as a ""trauma"". âIf weâre doing trauma therapy with anybody, say youâve been burgled or someone has died in your family, we say donât make any big decisions for 6-12 months,"" she says. ""We say that because you need 6-12 months between your trauma ending and you being able to assert where you are and how you feel during that time. âIf youâre divorcing someone because youâre actually unhappy with the world, not your relationship...you might end up feeling even worse in a yearâs time.â President Wavel Ramkalawan was the first to receive the vaccine The Indian Ocean nation of the Seychelles
has begun vaccinating its population, with President Wavel Ramkalawan the first
to receive the jab. Mr Ramkalawan was filmed live on
television receiving the vaccine at a hospital in the capital Victoria, alongside
a number of other public figures. âItâs exactly as if I was getting any
vaccine,â he said, encouraging other citizens to do the same. The archipelago says it is rolling out
some 50,000 doses of the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine, donated by the
United Arab Emirates. Health workers will receive it first,
then citizens over 65, before the rest of the 98,000 population. A further 50,000
doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, donated by India, are expected at the
end of January. The Seychelles has had around 500
recorded cases of the virus, with one death. A further 563 people died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 54,940 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are lower than yesterday's totals for deaths and cases - 1,035 and 59,937 respectively. But figures can be lower than the general trend during the weekend. Officers descended on Oldbury Court in Bristol at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday A teenager has been arrested and 38 fines issued over suspected plans to hold an illegal rave in Bristol. ""Bristol Freerave"" was promoted at an undisclosed location on social media but ""following intelligence"" officers descended on Oldbury Court in Fishponds at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday. The force said a ""significant number of people"" were in the area and 38 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid regulations were issued. A man, 19, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. He has since been released under investigation. Read more. More than 2,000 grey seals have been born at Horsey Gap in Norfolk during its annual pupping season. The new arrivals come as police patrol the area to deter visitors during the national lockdown. Seal protection charity, Friends of Horsey Seals, say they have recorded ""well over 2,000"" new seal pups but do not have a complete figure for the season which stretches from November to January. ""We suspended counting when the Covid restrictions made it impossible for our counters, so we don't have a complete figure this year,"" Jane Bowden, a warden and trustee for the charity, told the PA news agency. The charity has hundreds of volunteers from around the country but only local volunteers can help patrol the beach during lockdown, she says. Norfolk Police said it had fined a man and a woman in their 50s who admitted driving more than 120 miles from their home in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire to Horsey tolook at the seal colony on Thursday. Here are some of the coronavirus stories
making the headlines in Europe: When the
coronavirus emerged a year ago, two scientists â Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang in China and Prof Eddie Holmes in Australia - decided to publish the virus's entire genetic code online for anyone to
download. This set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. Two US pharmaceutical
companies â Moderna and Pfizer - began work on an experimental approach to swifter, simpler vaccine production. Chinese
and American scientists collaborated on more than 120 studies. Research centres in Europe, Asia and North America shared data on what
role genetics might play in how sick people get. And trials were carried out to see
whether existing treatments could help. Many scientists
agree that, over the long term, we face a world where the coronavirus is always
present in the global population at some level. That is why, Dr Holmes told the BBC, it is important that
channels of communication between scientists in every country remain open. Politics
can't come into it,"" he says. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less
safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about
fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA."" You can read the full report by BBC's Science Correspondent Victoria Gill here. A further 508 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 55,580, NHS England has said. Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded three deaths of coronavirus patients and 1,877 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to official figures. Scottish Government statistics indicate the daily test positivity rate is 10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. And Public Health Wales have reported another 45 deaths and 1,660 cases. In Northern Ireland, 17 more deaths have been reported in
the past 24 hours, along with 1,112 new cases. Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week,the government has announced. The London borough of Bexley sits on the border of London and Kent - which have both been hard hit by the new variant - and is one of the areas which will be involved in the programme. The borough's director of public health, Dr Anjan Ghosh, said the use of rapid tests was a useful tool to enable quick detection of cases in order to break the chain of transmission. However, he said it was ""not a solution in itself"" and had to be combined with other measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Dr Ghosh told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend Programme there had been strong demand for asymptomatic testing in Bexley, with all the slots available this week already booked up. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm In Sweden a new law has come into force, giving ministers the power to close venues including shops, gyms and cinemas for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The measures were voted through parliament in Stockholm on Friday, after politicians were called back early from their Christmas break. From the start of the pandemic,
Sweden took a different approach to the rest of Europe with a focus on
voluntary guidelines designed to last months rather than weeks; instead of going in and out of lockdown. But this new law allows the government to
introduce much stricter measures as the country battles with some of the
highest coronavirus infection rates in the EU. Ministers have already announced
a ban of more than eight people at bookable private party venues - from dining
halls to common rooms in apartment blocks. And they have said numbers should be
limited in gyms, swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are -
making sure there is at least 10 sq m (107 sq ft) available per person. Local
authorities will have the power to fine businesses that do not follow the rules,
or force them to close. Places of worship are allowed to stay open for communal services in some parts of the UK, despite the latest lockdowns. Unlike in November's lockdown, the government has allowed acts of communal worship to continue in England's churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. Places of worship are open for communal service in Wales, but the Welsh government guidance asks religious bodies to think about alternative ways of holding services - for example broadcasting services without a congregation. Where communal worship is allowed, measures are in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. For example worshippers should keep 2m (6ft) from anyone outside their own household and communal singing should be avoided. Places of worship in mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) are currently closed for either communal services or private prayer. And Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations are to cease public worship until early February. You can read more about the rules for places of worshiphere. From next weekend, India plans to begin rolling out one of the worldâs
most ambitious vaccination programmes. It aims to vaccinate 300 million people on its priority list by
July. That would mean administering 600 million doses overall - around 85 million doses a month. India - which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases globally after the US - also produces 60% of the world's vaccines. The country has pledged to meet its commitments to produce a share of the global supply in the fight against Covid-19, but this could mean its pharmaceutical companies having to produce more than a billion more doses. The BBCâs Reality Check looks at whether India can meet that demand. The UK government needs a long term plan focused on reducing
transmission to avoid future lockdowns, a scientist has said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist from Queen Mary
University, said although vaccines were âcriticalâ, even once the top four
priority groups are vaccinated there will still be many more vulnerable groups
who will not have received a vaccine by mid-February. âItâs really worrying this rhetoric that vaccines are this end
point that will allow us to open up society when the majority of people will
not be protected from infection,â she told the BBC. âWe need a long term plan so that once restrictions are eased
we donât end up exactly in the situation [of] needing yet another lockdown.â She added that this included an effective test-and-trace
system and quarantine measures at borders. Coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" in Scotland, says the deputy first minister as he refused to rule out tougher restrictions. Scotland is facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus, according to John Swinney, whose comments come as the country records its highest death toll so far in the pandemic in the last two days, where 93 Scots died from the virus. Swinney tells Politics Scotland: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet [on Monday] was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" Mr Swinney says Scotland recorded around 130 cases per 100,000 people on Boxing Day, but the figure shot up to 300 just 10 days later. Despite the new measures put in place, Mr Swinney said: ""It doesn't show much sign of abating to any extent. ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" He added: ""We remain open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in Bournemouth. The protest saw dozens of people ""try to march"" through the town centre on Saturday, Dorset Police said. The force's chief constable James Vaughan says: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" At least seven fixed penalty notices were also issued during the event. There were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest, the force says. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" More on this story. Here are some of the coronavirus stories making headlines around the world: Jim ReedBBC News The number of infections recorded in the UK has now been above
the 50,000 mark for 12 consecutive days. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more
deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per
day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the
start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost
certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have
any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more
âtransmissibleâ, possibly because each infected individual produces more of the
actual virus â sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from
serious symptoms but we donât yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual
contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be
needed to bring down the reinfection rate and start to reduce the overall size of
the pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0006268472

"Home Secretary Priti Patel has said officers ""will not hesitate"" to enforce lockdown rules as she defended the way police have handled breaches. She said rising numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths illustrated the need for ""strong enforcement"". It comes after the National Police Chiefs' Council published guidance saying officers should issue fines more quickly when rules are broken. More than 30,000 fines have been handed out by forces in England and Wales. NPCC figures show 32,329 fixed penalty notices were issued between 27 March and 21 December last year. Covid testing for asymptomatic workers expanded What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The number of people who have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid testsurpassed 80,000on Saturday, and a further 59,937 people tested positive. Ministers have launched a new campaign urging people toact like they have the virusand scientists have warned that lockdown measures in England need to be stricter. ""The vast majority of the public have supported this huge national effort and followed the rules,"" Ms Patel said. ""But the tragic number of new cases and deaths this week shows there is still a need for strong enforcement where people are clearly breaking these rules to ensure we safeguard our country's recovery from this deadly virus. ""Enforcing these rules saves lives. It is as simple as that. Officers will continue to engage with the public across the country and will not hesitate to take action when necessary."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned the public to follow the lockdown restrictions, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""every time you try to flex the rules, that could be fatal"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government for not providing ""absolute clarity of messaging"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr that there had been ""mixed messaging over the last nine months"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters NPCC guidance, published on 6 January, says officers should still offer people ""encouragement"" to comply with the regulations and explain any changes. ""However, if the individual or group does not respond appropriately, then enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" the NPCC said. Covid fine review welcomed by 'intimidated' women Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip Warnings 'blatantly ignored' as cars turned away On Saturday12 people were arrested during an anti-lockdown protestin south London. Elsewhere, North Wales Policeturned away more than 100 carsat Moel Famau in Flintshire by Saturday lunchtime, and Norfolk Police fined one couple who had travelled about 130 miles (209km) to see a seal colony. However, Derbyshire Police has launched an urgent review into how fines were issued after two women were charged Â£200 each. The pair were stopped by officers for walking five miles from their home with hot drinks, which they were told were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". John Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said officers were under ""immense pressure to do the right thing"" and said with ""such a changing landscape politically and legally"" there were going to be things which did not go right. He said the police had to balance the relationship with the public. ""It's not easy because all we are trying to do in policing is keep as many people safe as possible,"" he said.

"Every adult will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by autumn, Matt Hancock says But right now, people must follow lockdown guidance and stay at home, the health secretary says, as the situation for the NHS is 'very serious' A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were 54,940 new cases reported on Sunday Regular, rapid tests for people without symptoms of Covid-19 will be made available across England from this week Local authorities will be encouraged to target testing to people who cannot work from home during lockdown Global deaths from Covid-19 now stand at 1,928,136, and total cases have reached 89,718,548, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Claire Heald We're going to be wrapping up the live page shortly so here's a reminder of some of the stories we've covered today:  Many thanks for joining us today. Updates were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce and Penny Spiller.  Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey asked of them was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live between a 30 to 45-minute drive from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. Read more here. The government'sSelf Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)was set up to provide financial support to self-employed people who have lost income because of the pandemic. But campaigners say as many as three million self-employed people are not eligible for support. One of those is Cheryl Jones, who served in the Army before retiring to set up her own pet-sitting business. She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that she had not received any financial support from the government since the start of the pandemic when her business closed down. She receives a pension of just over Â£10,000 from the Army and the income from her business was just under Â£10,000. But to be eligible for the SEISS an individual must earn at least 50% of their total income from self-employment. Cheryl said she felt ""let down"" by the government, after being excluded from the scheme. âI am really proud that I served my country and I have
felt disillusioned, depressedâ¦ let down by the government, the country that I
served,"" she said. âI canât even sleep at night, I cry all the time and Iâm
not like that. I am a proud person but this has completely floored me.â The first few weeks of the new year are often when beleaguered couples decide enough is enough and start divorce proceedings. But relationship expert Emma Kenny has warned that this may not be the year to follow that pattern - it could be that weâre projecting our anxieties and frustrations around the coronavirus pandemic on to our partners. Speaking on Mornings, she says: âWe all [project] when weâre in a bad mood; we see our partner and we think that the reason weâre in a bad mood is because of everything they do, as opposed to the way that we feel.â Emma believes we should be wary of contemplating divorce at this moment in time and should view the pandemic as a ""trauma"". âIf weâre doing trauma therapy with anybody, say youâve been burgled or someone has died in your family, we say donât make any big decisions for 6-12 months,"" she says. ""We say that because you need 6-12 months between your trauma ending and you being able to assert where you are and how you feel during that time. âIf youâre divorcing someone because youâre actually unhappy with the world, not your relationship...you might end up feeling even worse in a yearâs time.â President Wavel Ramkalawan was the first to receive the vaccine The Indian Ocean nation of the Seychelles
has begun vaccinating its population, with President Wavel Ramkalawan the first
to receive the jab. Mr Ramkalawan was filmed live on
television receiving the vaccine at a hospital in the capital Victoria, alongside
a number of other public figures. âItâs exactly as if I was getting any
vaccine,â he said, encouraging other citizens to do the same. The archipelago says it is rolling out
some 50,000 doses of the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine, donated by the
United Arab Emirates. Health workers will receive it first,
then citizens over 65, before the rest of the 98,000 population. A further 50,000
doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, donated by India, are expected at the
end of January. The Seychelles has had around 500
recorded cases of the virus, with one death. A further 563 people died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 54,940 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are lower than yesterday's totals for deaths and cases - 1,035 and 59,937 respectively. But figures can be lower than the general trend during the weekend. Officers descended on Oldbury Court in Bristol at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday A teenager has been arrested and 38 fines issued over suspected plans to hold an illegal rave in Bristol. ""Bristol Freerave"" was promoted at an undisclosed location on social media but ""following intelligence"" officers descended on Oldbury Court in Fishponds at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday. The force said a ""significant number of people"" were in the area and 38 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid regulations were issued. A man, 19, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. He has since been released under investigation. Read more. More than 2,000 grey seals have been born at Horsey Gap in Norfolk during its annual pupping season. The new arrivals come as police patrol the area to deter visitors during the national lockdown. Seal protection charity, Friends of Horsey Seals, say they have recorded ""well over 2,000"" new seal pups but do not have a complete figure for the season which stretches from November to January. ""We suspended counting when the Covid restrictions made it impossible for our counters, so we don't have a complete figure this year,"" Jane Bowden, a warden and trustee for the charity, told the PA news agency. The charity has hundreds of volunteers from around the country but only local volunteers can help patrol the beach during lockdown, she says. Norfolk Police said it had fined a man and a woman in their 50s who admitted driving more than 120 miles from their home in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire to Horsey tolook at the seal colony on Thursday. Here are some of the coronavirus stories
making the headlines in Europe: When the
coronavirus emerged a year ago, two scientists â Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang in China and Prof Eddie Holmes in Australia - decided to publish the virus's entire genetic code online for anyone to
download. This set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. Two US pharmaceutical
companies â Moderna and Pfizer - began work on an experimental approach to swifter, simpler vaccine production. Chinese
and American scientists collaborated on more than 120 studies. Research centres in Europe, Asia and North America shared data on what
role genetics might play in how sick people get. And trials were carried out to see
whether existing treatments could help. Many scientists
agree that, over the long term, we face a world where the coronavirus is always
present in the global population at some level. That is why, Dr Holmes told the BBC, it is important that
channels of communication between scientists in every country remain open. Politics
can't come into it,"" he says. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less
safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about
fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA."" You can read the full report by BBC's Science Correspondent Victoria Gill here. A further 508 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 55,580, NHS England has said. Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded three deaths of coronavirus patients and 1,877 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to official figures. Scottish Government statistics indicate the daily test positivity rate is 10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. And Public Health Wales have reported another 45 deaths and 1,660 cases. In Northern Ireland, 17 more deaths have been reported in
the past 24 hours, along with 1,112 new cases. Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week,the government has announced. The London borough of Bexley sits on the border of London and Kent - which have both been hard hit by the new variant - and is one of the areas which will be involved in the programme. The borough's director of public health, Dr Anjan Ghosh, said the use of rapid tests was a useful tool to enable quick detection of cases in order to break the chain of transmission. However, he said it was ""not a solution in itself"" and had to be combined with other measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Dr Ghosh told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend Programme there had been strong demand for asymptomatic testing in Bexley, with all the slots available this week already booked up. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm In Sweden a new law has come into force, giving ministers the power to close venues including shops, gyms and cinemas for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The measures were voted through parliament in Stockholm on Friday, after politicians were called back early from their Christmas break. From the start of the pandemic,
Sweden took a different approach to the rest of Europe with a focus on
voluntary guidelines designed to last months rather than weeks; instead of going in and out of lockdown. But this new law allows the government to
introduce much stricter measures as the country battles with some of the
highest coronavirus infection rates in the EU. Ministers have already announced
a ban of more than eight people at bookable private party venues - from dining
halls to common rooms in apartment blocks. And they have said numbers should be
limited in gyms, swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are -
making sure there is at least 10 sq m (107 sq ft) available per person. Local
authorities will have the power to fine businesses that do not follow the rules,
or force them to close. Places of worship are allowed to stay open for communal services in some parts of the UK, despite the latest lockdowns. Unlike in November's lockdown, the government has allowed acts of communal worship to continue in England's churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. Places of worship are open for communal service in Wales, but the Welsh government guidance asks religious bodies to think about alternative ways of holding services - for example broadcasting services without a congregation. Where communal worship is allowed, measures are in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. For example worshippers should keep 2m (6ft) from anyone outside their own household and communal singing should be avoided. Places of worship in mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) are currently closed for either communal services or private prayer. And Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations are to cease public worship until early February. You can read more about the rules for places of worshiphere. From next weekend, India plans to begin rolling out one of the worldâs
most ambitious vaccination programmes. It aims to vaccinate 300 million people on its priority list by
July. That would mean administering 600 million doses overall - around 85 million doses a month. India - which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases globally after the US - also produces 60% of the world's vaccines. The country has pledged to meet its commitments to produce a share of the global supply in the fight against Covid-19, but this could mean its pharmaceutical companies having to produce more than a billion more doses. The BBCâs Reality Check looks at whether India can meet that demand. The UK government needs a long term plan focused on reducing
transmission to avoid future lockdowns, a scientist has said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist from Queen Mary
University, said although vaccines were âcriticalâ, even once the top four
priority groups are vaccinated there will still be many more vulnerable groups
who will not have received a vaccine by mid-February. âItâs really worrying this rhetoric that vaccines are this end
point that will allow us to open up society when the majority of people will
not be protected from infection,â she told the BBC. âWe need a long term plan so that once restrictions are eased
we donât end up exactly in the situation [of] needing yet another lockdown.â She added that this included an effective test-and-trace
system and quarantine measures at borders. Coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" in Scotland, says the deputy first minister as he refused to rule out tougher restrictions. Scotland is facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus, according to John Swinney, whose comments come as the country records its highest death toll so far in the pandemic in the last two days, where 93 Scots died from the virus. Swinney tells Politics Scotland: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet [on Monday] was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" Mr Swinney says Scotland recorded around 130 cases per 100,000 people on Boxing Day, but the figure shot up to 300 just 10 days later. Despite the new measures put in place, Mr Swinney said: ""It doesn't show much sign of abating to any extent. ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" He added: ""We remain open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in Bournemouth. The protest saw dozens of people ""try to march"" through the town centre on Saturday, Dorset Police said. The force's chief constable James Vaughan says: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" At least seven fixed penalty notices were also issued during the event. There were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest, the force says. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" More on this story. Here are some of the coronavirus stories making headlines around the world: Jim ReedBBC News The number of infections recorded in the UK has now been above
the 50,000 mark for 12 consecutive days. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more
deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per
day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the
start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost
certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have
any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more
âtransmissibleâ, possibly because each infected individual produces more of the
actual virus â sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from
serious symptoms but we donât yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual
contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be
needed to bring down the reinfection rate and start to reduce the overall size of
the pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,8.4626545e-06

Navy divers are confident that they will be able retrieve the two flight recorders when the search operation resumes on Monday. Aircraft parts and human remains have been found. The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 was carrying 62 people when it vanished from radar on its journey to Borneo. ""We have located the position of the black boxes, both of them,"" said Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, quoted by AFP earlier on Sunday. ""Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them."" The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or black boxes as they are often called, store data about planes. They can provide vital information in air accident investigations. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? Investigators are analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among crash missing A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 The search operation has been suspended for the night but is due to resume on Monday morning. However, there appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Debris believed to belong to the Sriwijaya Air flight that disappeared shortly after take-off from Jakarta A spokesman for the Jakarta police, Yusri Yunus, said two bags had been received from the search and rescue agency. ""The first bag contained passengers' properties, another bag contained body parts,"" he told reporters, adding: ""We are still identifying these findings."" Police are asking families of the victims to provide DNA samples and dental records to help identify the remains. Indonesian investigators inspect an item they believe could belong to the missing plane The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. The aircraft did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously for newsat the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Afrida's 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion was on the flight. Angga, a merchant seaman, had been told to go to Pontianak because his ship was damaged, she said. Just a week ago he had become a father. ""If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,"" she told BBC Indonesia. Family members of missing passengers wait for news at Pontianak airport, Indonesia Meanwhile relatives of the plane's captain, Afwan, a former air force pilot, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, described him as a devout Muslim and a ""very good man"". ""He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,"" says his nephew Ferza Mahardhika. ""I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family."" According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash.

"A crisis centre for relatives has been set up at the airport in Jakarta Relatives of the passengers and crew on board the ill-fated Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 are facing an agonising wait as authorities search for the wreckage. Sixty-two people were on board the passenger plane which plunged into the sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta on Saturday. There appears to be no hope of finding survivors. Although no-one on board has been formally identified, information is emerging from family and friends. Indonesia crashed plane's black boxes located ""We're in grief, still praying for the best,"" said Ferza Mahardhika, whose uncle was the pilot of the Sriwijaya SJ182 flight. Captain Afwan, 54, left home quickly on the day of the doomed flight, his nephew told BBC Indonesia, complaining that ""his shirt hadn't been ironed, when usually he is really neat"". The captain apologised to his three children for having to leave them again. Captain Afwan, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, started his flying career in the air force before becoming a commercial pilot in 1987. His family and colleagues say he was devoted Muslim, eager to help people in his neighbourhood in the West Java town of Bogor, and at work. His profile picture on social media is a cartoon of Superman praying, with the words ""it doesn't matter how high you fly, you will never reach heaven if you don't pray"".

He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,"" said Ferza Mahardhika. ""I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family,"" he added. Also on board was 15-year-old Dinda Amelia, who had originally gone to Jakarta on vacation. Dinda had gone with her mother's employer whom she was close to, along with the family's two children. Lena, her mother, said she had been working for her employer's family for a long time, and so did not refuse Dinda's request to follow the family on vacation. Lena's mother holding a photo of her daughter They left for Jakarta on 27 December - but never returned. ""She left right on her 15th birthday,"" her mother told BBC Indonesian. ""She was very happy."" Speaking to reporters, Lena showed them a photo of Dinda on her phone, while crying and saying: ""Come back little one."" Angga Fernanda Afrion's mother, Afrida, is pictured holding a photograph of her son Afrida told BBC Indonesia she was still holding out hope that her 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion, who was on the flight, might still be alive. ""Family members who are in Jakarta are searching for information. I want to go, too, but with the pandemic it's difficult to travel,"" said Afrida, who lives in West Sumatra. Just a week ago Angga - a seaman - had become a father, his wife giving birth to their first child, a boy named Alvano Faeyza Alingga. His mother said that becoming a father had motived him to work harder to provide the best for his son. Angga worked on large cargo boats. His mother says he called her late on Friday saying that he had to fly to Pontianak at the last minute because ""his ship was damaged and his boss had told him he needed to come"". He often had to travel for work across the Indonesian archipelago but preferred to travel by boat, rarely flying. Afrida said her son was ""a strong-willed child but was very obedient. He was a kind polite person and could get on well with anyone."" ""If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,"" she said quietly, while holding a framed photo of Angga in his uniform. Also on board were newly married couple Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and Putri Wahyuni. Ihsan's younger brother, Arwin Amru Hakim, told news website Kompas that his brother had called from Soekarno Hatta Airport to let the family know their flight had been delayed, due to bad weather.

"This video can not be played Asymptomatic testing for Covid can help ""break the chains of transmission"", Matt Hancock says Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week, the government has said. The community testing regime - expanded to cover all 317 local authorities - uses rapid lateral flow tests, which can return results in 30 minutes. Local councils are being encouraged to prioritise tests for those who cannot work from home during the lockdown. The health secretary said asymptomatic testing can help break transmission. Meanwhile, NHS England has invited tens of thousands of people over 80 to book vaccinations. Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warn Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 54,940 cases reported, according to government figures on Sunday. The total number of deaths in the UK after a positive testpassed 80,000 on Saturday. The governmenthas launched a campaigntelling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Department of Health and Social Care said expanding the Community Testing Programme to more people without symptoms was ""crucial given that around one in three people"" who contract Covid-19 show no symptoms. It said regular community testing using the rapid tests had already identified more than 14,800 positive Covid-19 cases. So far, 131 local authorities in England have enrolled in the government's community testing programme, with Milton Keynes, Slough, Doncaster and Essex the latest to join. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said targeted asymptomatic testing and subsequent isolation was ""highly effective in breaking chains of transmission"". But Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol Medical School, said increasing lateral flow testing was ""very worrying"" and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases ""will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests"". Defending lateral flow tests on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Mr Hancock said mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool had seen the case rate drop ""more sharply than it did in other similar areas where only restrictions were brought in"". NHS Test and Trace will also work closely with other government departments to scale up workforce testing, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Many are already piloting regular workforce testing, with 15 large employers having taken up this offer already across 64 sites, ""including organisations operating in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks and the military"". The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place for rapid testing of staff and students in schools and colleges and staff in primary schools. Asked when schools could reopen by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Hancock said there were four conditions: that there is not a major new variant, the vaccine rollout is proceeding effectively, the number of deaths is falling and there is an easing of pressure on the NHS. Businesses have welcomed asymptomatic testing. Matthew Fell, of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said: ""This expansion of testing will help more critical workers and those unable to work from home to operate safely, while also catching new cases more swiftly."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the safety of the workforce had been an ""absolute priority"" and said the expansion of testing means ""we can keep our economy on the move while giving individuals in key sectors complete confidence that their workplace is safe"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters But Prof Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, told BBC Breakfast the country would continue a ""yo-yoing of lockdown"" without a ""test, trace and isolate system that actually works"" and warned there needed to be tighter restrictions and tougher messaging than in March to prevent ""tens of thousands of avoidable deaths in the next few weeks"". In other developments: Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises the government,has said people must take lockdown seriouslyas ""we are now in the eye of a storm"" Two million people have been inoculated so far, Mr Hancock has said, adding that the government is on course to reach its target of 13 million people vaccinated by mid-February British Medical Association chairman Chaand Nagpaul revealed that more than 46,000 hospital staff are off sick with Covid-19, which is beginning to affect the vaccination programme,the Observer reports,external London Mayor Sadiq Khan has welcomed the opening of a vaccination centre at the ExCel Centre in east London next week - which he said would be crucial in helping to accelerate the rollout of the vaccine The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be availablein more than 1,000 locations in Scotland from Monday, the nation's government has said Buckingham Palace saidthe Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, received Covid-19 vaccinations on Saturday- they are among about 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far THE JOE WICKS PODCAST:Joe asks some of his inspiring mates about their secret to physical and mental happiness THE CIPHER:A new thriller from BBC Sounds.

"Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday Bans imposed by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Donald Trump's accounts raise a ""very big question"" about how social media is regulated, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The companies acted after supporters of the US president stormed Washington DC's Capitol building on Wednesday. Mr Hancock said the bans showed they were now ""taking editorial decisions"". Campaigners want social media to be treated as ""publishers"", rather than ""platforms"", meaning more regulation. But opponents of the idea argue that it could allow governments to limit debate. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account 'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots Trump to take 'big action' against social media More powers for Ofcom to police social media firms Mr Trump faces an impeachment charge, with Democrats accusing the Republican president of encouraging the Washington riots, in which five people died. Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". But Mr Trump called this an attack on free speech and suggested he would look at ""building out our own platform in the future"". There has been a long-running debate over whether social media companies should be treated in law as ""publishers"", with greater responsibility for dealing with libellous, discriminatory, misleading or incendiary content posted by users. Mr Hancock, a former culture secretary, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump - the scenes at the Capitol - were terrible - and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. ""But there's something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That's clear because they're choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice on their platform."" Mr Hancock said that development was likely to have ""consequences"". Asked earlier about Twitter's decision to ban Mr Trump's account, he told Sky News: ""I think it raises a very important question, which is it means that the social media platforms are taking editorial decisions. ""And that is a very big question because then it raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they're regulated."" Twitter's ban on Mr Trump's account followed the increasing use of warning labels on his posts referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the result of the US presidential election. In a blog on Friday, the company said its public interest framework existed ""to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly"". It added: ""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement."" Facebook and Instagram banned Mr Trump ""indefinitely"" on Thursday, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying this sanction would not be lifted until at least 20 January, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the new US president.

"""Absurd"" council tax rises should be scrapped to ease the pressure on family budgets, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Local authorities in England will be able to raise council tax by 5% from April, with 3% used to top up adult social care budgets. Sir Keir said this meant those living in a band D property could see bills rise by an average of Â£90. He added that the prime minister should provide extra funding to councils. But the government says the rise in council tax bills, plus extra money from central government, will ensure a real-terms increase in support for local services. Council tax to rise by up to 5% next year Council tax 'likely to rise' after Sunak review Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Sir Keirwrote in the Sunday Telegraph:,external""It is absurd that during the deepest recession in 300 years, at the very time millions are worried about the future of their jobs and how they will make ends meet, Boris Johnson and [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak are forcing local government to hike up council tax. ""The prime minister said he would do 'whatever is necessary' to support local authorities in providing vital services - he needs to make good on that promise."" Sir Keir urged Mr Johnson to ""give families the security they need"" by dropping the tax increase. He said families had been treated as an ""afterthought"" by the government during the pandemic, adding that Labour would become the ""party of the family"" under his leadership. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""Council tax plays an important role in helping fund the frontline services needed to respond to the pandemic. ""Our approach strikes a balance between allowing local authorities to address service pressures and ensuring local residents have the final say on excessive increases."" A Â£500m fund to support people struggling with finances meant councils could ""cut bills further for some of the most vulnerable households"", they added, while a Â£7.2bn support package would help meet ""the major Covid-19 service pressures in their local area"". The chancellor's Spending Review in November set out the cost to the UK economy so far of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Sunak warned the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun,with lasting damage to growth and jobs. Interviewed on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said there was no scope for a ""major renegotiation"" of the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, but added that there were ""bits already that need to be improved on"". And, asked about the possibility of another Scottish referendum on independence from the UK, he said that a ""further, divisive"" vote was not ""the way forward"". ""But I do accept that the status quo isn't working"", Sir Keir added. ""I don't accept the argument that the status quo isn't working, the next thing you do is go to a referendum."" The prime minister has said such a vote - last held in 2014 - should be a ""once-in-a-generation"" event. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum should take place.

"Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live about 30 to 45 minutes' drive away from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. The seven centres include Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, London's Nightingale hospital, Newcastle's Centre for Life, the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre, Robertson House in Stevenage and Birmingham's Millennium Point. People will not miss out on their vaccination if they do not use the letters to make an appointment at one of the centres, the NHS said. Two Labour MPs tweeted about their concerns about the letters being delayed in getting out to people due to coronavirus affecting Royal Mail staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mary McGarry from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire told BBC News that her letter points to an NHS online booking page which suggests she would have to take her husband, who has cancer and a lung disease, 20 miles to Birmingham. ""We're very reluctant to go into Birmingham city centre,"" she said. ""If we can't get somebody to take us, we'd have to go on the train but we're shielding because my husband's got poor health.... we want to know why we've got to travel that far?"" Kay Hayward, from Whitwick in Leicestershire, said she went online to book an appointment for her 85-year-old husband Kenneth and was offered five different places including Widnes in Cheshire and Stevenage in Hertfordshire. ""I thought they must be joking... we talked about it and we thought it was actually safer to stay here and for him not not have it. 130,000 letters have been sent out by NHS England so far ""But we were worried if we turned this down, we'd be off the list.. the letter doesn't say anything about having the vaccines anywhere else locally."" Andrea Eaton, from Coventry, said she was so angry that her 81-year-old mother, who has heart problems and leukaemia, was offered Birmingham for her appointment that she attempted to ring Downing Street on Saturday night to complain. She said she reached the press office and said: ""I want you to give Boris a message please that he has lied to the British public. ""He has told themthey never need to go more than 10 miles... they were really rude and just put the phone down on me."" Andrea Eaton said she wanted to get a message to Boris Johnson so rang Downing Street on Saturday evening A spokesperson from Number 10 told BBC News that they did not wish to comment, but wanted to remind the public to use the government website to write to the prime minister or contact their constituency MP. Councillor Shaun Davies, the Labour leader at Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said he had been contacted by dozens of people who have found the letters misleading, thinking this is their only chance to get the vaccine. He said he had spoken to Trafford Council and was aware of people in Shropshire being sent to Manchester and residents there being directed to Birmingham to get their jabs. ""For many people they have been told consistently to wait for the NHS to contact you in order to get a vaccine and that's what they've had for the first time as a piece of communication. ""This is really, really concerning for people in their 80s or 90s because of the importance of getting the vaccine."" The letters are not ""going to the heart"" of the public health message which is staying home and staying local, he said. More than 500,000 letters will be sent out to homes offering people appointments at the centres over the next seven days Dr Sarah Raistrick, from Coventry and Rugby Clinical Commission group (CCG), said people did not have to travel to the centres but admitted the letter did not make that clear.

"Eleanor Wadsworth was a civilian pilot with the Air Transport Auxiliary One of the last surviving ""Spitfire Women"", who ferried aircraft to the front line in World War Two, has died. Eleanor Wadsworth, who was 103, was part of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), a civilian service that transported fighter aircraft and crew. The ATA Association,externalsaid she was among 165 women who flew without radios or instrument flying instructions. Mrs Wadsworth, who lived in Bury St Edmunds, died in December after a month of illness. During the war, about 1,250 men and women from 25 countries transferred some 309,000 aircraft of 147 different types. Mrs Wadsworth said the ""thought of learning to fly for free was a great incentive"" to join the ATA Mrs Wadsworth, who was born in Nottingham, joined the ATA in 1943 after seeing an advertisement for female pilots and was one of the first six successful candidates to be accepted with no or little previous flying experience, historian Sally McGlone said. Grace Spitfire at Bentwaters show,external WW1 Zeppelin attack remembered Farm owners 'supported Nazis in WW2' In 2020, the former pilot toldher housing association's in-house magazine,externalthat she had been ""looking for a new challenge"" when she joined the service. ""The thought of learning to fly for free was a great incentive [so] I put my name down and didn't think much about it,"" she said. She added that she had enjoyed flying Spitfires the most, which she did 132 times. ""It was a beautiful aircraft, great to handle,"" she said.

"Amazon is removing ""free speech"" social network Parler from its web hosting service for violating rules. If Parler fails to find a new web hosting service by Sunday evening, the entire network will go offline. Parler styles itself as an ""unbiased"" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter. Amazon told Parler it had found 98 posts on the site that encouraged violence. Apple and Google have removed the app from their stores. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth in 2020. Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 4.9 million followers on the platform, while Fox News host Sean Hannity has about seven million. The move comes after Apple suspended Parler from its app store. The suspension will remain in place for as long as the network continued to spread posts that incite violence, it said. Googleremoved the app from its store on Friday. Parler tops app charts in wake of Trump defeat Tech chiefs face tough questions over internet law Responding to Google's move earlier, Parler's chief executive John Matze said: ""We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!"" He also warned that Parlercould be offline for up to a week while ""we rebuild from scratch"",external. It briefly became the most-downloaded app in the United States after the US election, following a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook. In a letter obtained by CNN, Amazon's AWS Trust and Safety teamtold Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff,externalthat the social network ""does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service"". ""AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site"", the letter said. ""However we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others."". Parler will be removed from Amazon's web hosting service shortly before midnight on Sunday Pacific Standard Time (07:59 GMT on Monday). On Saturday, Apple removed Parler from its app store after warning the network to remove content that violated its rules or face a ban. ""Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety"",it said in a statement announcing the app's suspension,externalon Saturday evening. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring For months, Parler has been one of the most popular social media platforms for right-wing users. As major platforms began taking action against viral conspiracy theories, disinformation and the harassment of election workers and officials in the aftermath of the US presidential vote, the app became more popular with elements of the fringe far-right. This turned the network into a right-wing echo chamber, almost entirely populated by users fixated on revealing examples of election fraud and posting messages in support of attempts to overturn the election outcome. In the days preceding the Capitol riots, the tone of discussion on the app became significantly more violent, with some users openly discussing ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory by Congress. Unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory claims against a number of senior US figures such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice-President Mike Pence were rife on the app. Google and Apple say they are taking necessary action to ensure violent rhetoric is not promoted on their platforms. However, to those increasingly concerned about freedom of speech and expression on online platforms, it represents another example of draconian action by major tech companies which threatens internet freedom. This is a debate which is certain to continue beyond the Trump presidency.

"NI's six health trusts have warned that by the third week of January, NI hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients. In ajoint statement,external, the trust chief executives said the figures were based on modelling projections. They also said there were staffing concerns at a time when there are increased numbers of patients. Earlier on Sunday night, the Western Health Trust issued an appeal to off-duty staff. It called for any staff near South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to either contact the trust or go to the hospital. The hospital has additional beds and the staff were wanted so it could help out the Southern Health Trust, which was under severe pressure at Craigavon Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital. The Western Trust has since said it was ""overwhelmed by the offers of help and support from"" staff and that the situation has now stabilised. It added that it no longer anticipated patients being diverted from Craigavon or Daisy Hill to SWAH. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's about 700 people. ""At the peak of the first surge there were 400 people in hospital so already we're in a very grave situation."" On Sunday there were 703 people in hospital with the virus, 53 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 34 being ventilated. Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said staff were working ""above their contracted obligations, are overworked and overtired"".

In the joint statement, trust executives urged the public to ""stay at home, practise social distancing, hand hygiene and wear face coverings."" In December they warned""several of NI's acute hospitals were operating beyond capacity"". In their latest statement, the trusts said dealing with the pandemic was now ""not a simple matter of putting up more beds."" The statement said: ""We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. ""Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren't there.""

Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal' Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery In their statement, the trusts made reference to thestanding down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery. ""This was to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both Covid and non-Covid patients needing ICU care,"" they said. The trusts said the postponed operations would be rescheduled as soon as possible. They added that patients who did undergo surgery may need to travel further for it. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options. They said that staff ""although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it."" However, the chief executives added that it would not be easy and the ""care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best."" In December some patients had to be treated in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital The trusts also warned the public that no-one should be attending a hospital emergency department at any time unless they need emergency care and said longer waits were likely They added that patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. ""This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to life threatening emergencies in the community,"" the statement said. The trusts said the vaccines rollout ""provides the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge."" The Health Department anticipates the vaccination programme will continue until the summer of 2021. New lockdownrestrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons.

"Business interest ""should not dominate the conversation"" about whether the school transfer test should take place this year, a Catholic bishop has said. There has beenintense debate this week about the academic selection processfor Northern Ireland grammar schools. One test provider cancelled its exams due to the Covid-19 crisis but another said it would test children next month. Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown said the test process - which is run by private companies - had become ""big business"". The Association for Quality Education (AQE) said on Tuesday that it intends to runone test in a single sitting in Februaryrather than the usual series of exams. Parents pay a fee of Â£55 for their child to take the AQE test. Bishop Donal McKeown says there ""should have been a plan B"" for the transfer test system The Post-Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC) - which does not charge for entry to its process - has cancelled its tests in 2021. Bishop McKeown told the BBC's Sunday Politics Northern Ireland programme: ""AQE would have about 9,000 pupils applying this year... that's half a million pounds coming in to run a business. ""And let's say you work on the assumption that parents are spending maybe Â£250 on tutoring [for their children] - there's another Â£2.5m. ""We're not just talking about making educational changes - we are talking about a business. ""When business becomes a major element in educational decisions I think, perhaps, we've lost the point."" The AQE told BBC News NI on Tuesday that schools using its test believed the process was the ""fairest way of allocating grammar school places"". There have been calls for the AQE to cancel its test due to the Covid-19 crisis, withmany pupils facing a prolonged period of learning from homeamid the tightening of the Covid-19 lockdown. A small number of grammar schools that would typically use the test to select their pupils for the following academic year have since decided not to proceed with it in 2021. The transfer test has long been a controversial issue in Northern Ireland, with some political parties opposing its use. Stormont ministers clashed on Friday about whether to the executive should intervene in the AQE's decision. Most grammar schools have used the test to select pupils since the 11-plus exam was scrapped in 2008 Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party - which all oppose academic selection - argued that the test should not take place due to the pandemic. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it supports the right for schools to select their pupils. Education Minister Peter Weir - a member of the DUP - has agreed to present a paper on the issue at a future meeting of the Stormont executive. The AQE has said that without the test many schools were likely to be even more oversubscribed than in a normal year and that more random criteria would be used to select pupils. That would include ""family ties, geographical proximity to a school or some form of lottery for places"". An Ulster Unionist MLA has suggested an alternative plan butit has been rejected by a headteachers' union. Bishop McKeown said: ""The public education system has to be focused on doing the best for the largest number of people. ""It can end up ceasing to be primarily a test of academic ability and more become a measure of those who are financially able. ""I hope our politicians could grapple with that reality - when business enters education we have to ask questions."" Schools that have pulled out of the testing process said they were reviewing their contingency admissions criteria and would publish those in due course. Bishop McKeown said there ""should have had a plan B long in advance"". ""We really are out of options now - we have to say: 'How can we focus on doing the best for the largest number, particularly the most disadvantaged?'""

"Sarah and her husband Gary lived in the caravan on the drive for nine months A nurse who lived in a caravan for nine months to protect her mother from coronavirus says moving back into her house was like ""winning the lottery"". Sarah Link and her husband Gary, who usually share a home with her mother, bought the caravan in March to allow them to isolate. ""I have cried a river in the caravan, if it wasn't for Gary, I wouldn't have got through it,"" Mrs Link said. They moved back home for Christmas after her mother received the vaccine. The caravan, bought for Â£600 and parked on their own drive in Cradley, in the Black Country, allowed Mrs Link to continue working at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital and her husband at his fishmonger's business. ""I'd do it again tomorrow. I would do it every time, I would have done anything to protect mum,"" she said. ""We were thinking it would be four weeks, 12 weeks max, then the summer came and went and nine months later we were still there. It was incredible, I just can't believe we did it,"" Mrs Link, who has been a nurse for 17 years, said. The couple both contracted coronavirus in December, but carried on living in the caravan so they could self-isolate and continue to protect Mrs Link's 84-year-old mother. Mrs Link said her Christmas this year was ""magical"" after moving out of the caravan ""I went back to work properly last week. I still get tired easily and suffer with fatigue, but I'm OK,"" Mrs Link said. ""It's getting ridiculous the cases... some people still walk around and don't believe it's real.

"The blackout affected major cities nationwide, including Karachi Electricity is gradually being restored in Pakistan following a huge power cut across the country, which led to every city reporting outages. Homes nationwide were suddenly plunged into darkness from about midnight. Power is now back in most cities but officials warn that it could still be a few hours before electricity is fully restored. The outage is believed to have been caused by a fault at a power plant in the south of the country. Power cuts are not uncommon in Pakistan. Essential facilities such as hospitals often use diesel-fuelled generators as a back-up power supply. ""A countrywide blackout has been caused by a sudden plunge in the frequency in the power transmission system,"" Pakistan's power minister, Omar Ayub Khan, wrote on Twitter in the early hours of Sunday. Homes across the country were plunged into darkness at about midnight Mr Khan later said that power had been restored in most major cities but that it would take a few more hours for the grid to go completely back to normal. He added that the outage occurred after a fault developed at the Guddu power plant in Sindh province shortly before midnight on Saturday (19:00 GMT). Investigators were at the site to ascertain the cause of the fault, Mr Khan said. Blackouts sometimes occur in Pakistan because of chronic power shortages, with many areas having no electricity for several hours a day. The issue has previously led to street protests. In 2013, Pakistan's electricity network broke down completely after a power plant in south-western Balochistan province developed a technical fault. Pakistanis seem to have largely taken this power cut in their stride. Outages lasting a number of hours are not uncommon, though they are rarely on this scale, and normally occur during the hotter summer months. The last time there was a near national blackout like this was in 2015. So far, there have been no reports of problems at hospitals, which have their own back-up supplies. A senior member of staff at a major hospital in the city of Karachi told me they could maintain services for 48-72 hours without mainline power. Many businesses and richer families invariably own diesel or petrol fuelled generators too, allowing them to continue using electricity whenever power cuts occur. There were reports of queues at some petrol stations earlier in the day as people tried to keep refilling their generators. Others will have been without internet and phone access, or hot water, but - already used to periods without electricity - appear to have accepted the outage with an air of resignation.

"Many were taken by surprise by the events in Washington, but to those who closely follow conspiracy and extreme right groups online, the warning signs were all there. At 02:21 Eastern Standard Time on election night, President Trump walked onto a stage set up in the East Room of the White House and declared victory. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."" His speech came an hour after he'd tweeted: ""They are trying to steal the election"". He hadn't won. There was no victory to steal. But to many of his most fervent supporters, these facts didn't matter, and still don't. Sixty five days later, a motley coalition of rioters stormed the US Capitol building. They included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, members of ""Stop the Steal"" groups, far-right activists, online trolls and others. On Friday 8 January -  some 48 hours after the Washington riots - Twitter began a purge of some of the most influential pro-Trump accounts that had been pushing conspiracies and urging direct action to overturn the election result. Then came the big one - Mr Trump himself. The president was permanently banned from tweeting to his more than 88 million followers ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"". The violence in Washington shocked the world and seemed to catch the authorities off guard. But for anyone who had been carefully watching the unfolding story - online and on the streets of American cities - it came as no surprise. The idea of a rigged election was seeded by the president in speeches and on Twitter, months before the vote. On election day, the rumors started just as Americans were going to the polls. A video of a Republican poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station went viral. It was a genuine error, caused by confusion about the rules. The man was laterallowed into the stationto observe the count. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But it became the first of many videos, images, graphics and claims that went viral in the days that followed, giving rise to a hashtag: #StopTheSteal. The message behind it was clear - Mr Trump had won a landslide victory, but dark forces in the establishment ""deep state"" had stolen it from him. In the early hours of Wednesday 4 November, while votes were still being counted and three days before the US networks called the election for Joe Biden, President Trump claimed victory, alleging ""a fraud on the American public"". Mr Trump did not provide any evidence to back up his claims.Studies carried out for previous US electionshave shown that voter fraud is extremely rare. By mid-afternoon a Facebook group called ""Stop the Steal"" was created and quickly became one of the fastest-growing in the platform's history. By Thursday morning, it had added more than 300,000 members. Many of the posts focused on unsubstantiated allegations of mass voter fraud, including manufactured claims that thousands of dead people had voted and that voting machines had somehow been programmed to flip votes from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. 'Stop the steal': The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive US Election 2020: Trump claims about Dominion machines fact-checked But some of the posts were more alarming, speaking of the need for a ""civil war"" or ""revolution"". By Thursday afternoon, Facebook had taken down Stop the Steal, but not before it had generated nearly half a million comments, shares, likes, and reactions. Dozens of other groups quickly sprang up in its place. The idea of a stolen election continued to spread online and take hold. Soon, a dedicated Stop the Steal website was launched in a bid to register ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote"". On Saturday 7 November, major news organisations declared that Joe Biden had won the election. In Democratic strongholds, throngs of people took to the streets to celebrate. But the reaction online from Mr Trump's most ardent supporters was one of anger and defiance. They planned a rally in Washington DC for the following Saturday, dubbed the Million MAGA (Make America Great Again) March. Trump tweeted that he might try to stop by the demonstration and ""say hello"". Previous pro-Trump rallies in Washington had failed to attract large crowds. But thousands gathered at Freedom Plaza that sunny morning. One extremism researchercalled it,externalthe ""debut of the pro-Trump insurgency"". As Trump's motorcade drove through the city, supporters screaming with delight rushed to catch a glimpse of the president, who beamed at them wearing a red MAGA hat. While mainstream conservative figures were present, the event was dominated by far-right groups. Dozens of members of the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group Proud Boys, who have repeatedly been involved in violent street protests and were among those who would later break into the US Capitol, joined the march. Militia groups, far-right media figures and promoters of conspiracy theories were also there. Capitol riots: Who broke into the building? US Election 2020: Who are the Proud Boys - and who are antifa? As night fell, clashes between Trump supporters and counter-protesters broke out, including a brawl about five blocks from the White House. The violence - although largely contained by police on this occasion - was a clear sign of things to come. By now, President Trump and his legal team had invested their hopes in dozens of legal cases. Although a number of courts had already dismissed fraud allegations, many in the pro-Trump online world became fascinated with two lawyers with close ties to the president - Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood. Ms Powell and Mr Wood promised they were preparing cases of voter fraud so comprehensive that when released, they would destroy the case for Mr Biden having won the presidency. Watch Aleem Maqbool's film America: Storming the Capitol, in which he examines the question - how safe is American democracy? Ms Powell, 65, a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor, told Fox News that the effort would ""release the Kraken"" - a reference to a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies. The ""Kraken"" quickly became an internet meme, representing sprawling, unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud. Ms Powell and Mr Wood became heroes to followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory - who believe President Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state made up of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. What is QAnon? What is the 'Kraken' conspiracy? The lawyers became a conduit between the president and his most conspiracy-minded supporters - a number of whom ended up inside the Capitol on 6 January. Ms Powell and Mr Wood were successful in whipping up sound and fury online, but their legal efforts came to nothing. When they released almost 200 pages of documents in late November, it became clear thattheir lawsuitconsisted predominantly of conspiracy theories and debunked allegations that had already been rejected by dozens of courts. The filings contained simple legal errors - and basic misspellings and typos. Still, the meme lived on. The terms ""Kraken"" and ""Release the Kraken"" were used more than a million times on Twitter before the Capitol riot. As courts rejected Mr Trump's legal cases, far-right activists increasingly targeted election workers and officials. Death threats were made against a Georgia election worker, and Republican officials in the state - including Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the official in charge of the state's voting systems, Gabriel Sterling - were branded ""traitors"" online. Mr Sterling issued an emotional and prescient warning to the president in a press conference on 1 December. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right,"" he said. In Michigan in early December, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, had just finished trimming her Christmas tree with her four-year-old son when she heard a commotion outside her Detroit home. About 30 protesters with banners stood outside, shouting ""Stop the steal!"" through megaphones. ""Benson, you are a villain,"" one person yelled. ""You're a threat to democracy!"" called another. One of the demonstrators live-streamed the protest on Facebook, stating that her group was ""not going away"". It was just one of a rash of protests targeting people involved in the vote. In Georgia, a constant stream of Trump supporters drove past Mr Raffensperger's home, honking their horns. His wife received threats of sexual violence. In Arizona, demonstrators gathered outside of the home of Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, at one point warning: ""We are watching you."" On 11 December,the Supreme Court rejectedan attempt by the state of Texas to throw out election results. As the president's legal and political windows continued to close, the language in pro-Trump online circles became increasingly violent. On 12 December, a second Stop the Steal rally was held in the capital. Once again, thousands attended, and once again prominent far-right activists, QAnon supporters, fringe MAGA groups and militia movements were among the demonstrators. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security advisor, likened the protesters to the biblical soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho. This echoed the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. Nick Fuentes, the leader of Groypers, a far-right movement that targets Republican politicians and figures they deem too moderate, told the crowd: ""We are going to destroy the GOP!"" The march once againturned violent. Then two days later,the Electoral College certifiedMr Biden's victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office. On online platforms, supporters were becoming resigned to the view that all legal avenues were dead ends, and only direct action could save the Trump presidency. Since election day, alongside Mr Flynn, Ms Powell and Mr Wood, a new figure had rapidly gained prominence among pro-Trump circles online. Ron Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins, the man behind 8chan and 8kun - message boards filled with extreme language and views, violence and extreme sexual content. They gave rise to the QAnon movement. In a series of viral tweets on 17 December, Ron Watkins suggested President Trump should follow the example of Roman leader Julius Caesar, and capitalise on ""fierce loyalty of the military"" in order to ""restore the Republic"". Ron Watkins encouraged his more than 500,000 followers to make #CrossTheRubicon a Twitter trend, referring to the moment when Caesar launched a civil war by crossing the Rubicon river in 49BC. The hashtag was also used by more mainstream figures - including the chairwoman of Arizona Republican Party,Kelli Ward,external. In a separate tweet, Ron Watkins said Mr Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act, which empowers the president to deploy the military and federal forces. Mr Trump met Ms Powell, Mr Flynn and others at a strategy meeting at the White House the following day, 18 December. During the meeting, according to the New York Times, Mr Flynn called on Mr Trump toimpose martial law,externaland deploy the military to ""rerun"" the election. The meeting further stoked online chatter about ""war"" and ""revolution"" in far-right circles. Many came to see the joint session of Congress on 6 January, normally a formality, as a last roll of the dice. A wishful story began to take hold among QAnon and some MAGA supporters. They hoped that Vice-President Mike Pence, who was set to preside over the 6 January ceremony, would ignore the electoral college votes. The president, they said, would then deploy the military to quell any unrest, order the mass arrest of the ""deep state cabal"" who had rigged the election and send them to Guantanamo Bay military prison. Back in the land of reality, none of this was remotely feasible. But it launched a movement for ""patriot caravans"" to organise ride shares to help transport thousands from around the country to Washington DC on 6 January. Long processions of vehicles flying Trump flags and sometimes towing elaborately decorated trailers gathered in car parks in cities including Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""We are on our way,"" one caravaner posted on Twitter with a picture of about two dozen supporters. At an Ikea parking lot in North Carolina, another man showed off his truck. ""The flags are a little tattered - we'll call them battle flags now,"" he said. As it became clear that Mr Pence and other key Republicans would follow the law and allow Congress to certify Mr Biden's win, the language towards them became vicious. ""Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason,"" Mr Wood tweeted. ""He will face execution by firing squad."" Online discussion reached boiling point. References to firearms, war and violence were rife on self-styled ""free speech""social platformssuch as Gab and Parler, which are popular with Trump supporters, as well as on other sites. In Proud Boys groups, where members had once supported police, some turned against authorities, whom they deemed to no longer be on their side. Hundreds of posts on a popular pro-Trump site, TheDonald, openly discussed plans to cross barricades, carry firearms and other weapons to the march in defiance of Washington's strict gun laws. There was open chatter about storming the Capitol and arresting ""treasonous"" members of Congress. On Wednesday 6 January, Mr Trump addressed a crowd of thousands at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, for more than an hour. Early on he encouraged supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard"", but he ended with a warning. ""We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. ""So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ¦ and we're going to the Capitol."" To some observers, the potential for violence that day was clear from the outset. Michael Chertoff, former secretary of homeland security under President George W Bush, blamed the Capitol Police, who reportedly turned down offers of assistance from the much larger National Guard ahead of time. He characterised it as ""the worst failure of a police force I can think of"". ""I think it was a very foreseeable potential negative turn of events,"" Mr Chertoff said. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol ""To be blunt, it was obvious. If you read the newspaper and were awake, you understood that you've got a lot of people who have been convinced there was a fraudulent election. Some of them are extremists, and violent. Some of the groups openly said, 'Bring your guns'."" Still, many Americans were astonished by Wednesday's scenes, like James Clark, a 68-year-old Republican from Virginia. ""I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this,""he toldthe BBC. But the signs were there for weeks. A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups were convinced that the election was stolen. Online, they repeatedly talked about arming themselves, and violence. Perhaps the authorities didn't think their posts were serious, or specific enough to investigate. They now face pointed questions. For Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January, Mr Chertoff is expecting a ""much stronger showing"" by security services than last Wednesday night. But that hasn't stopped many on extreme platforms calling for further violence and disruption on the day. There are questions, too, for the major social media platforms, which enabled conspiracy theories to reach millions of people. Late on Friday, Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr Flynn, the former Trump advisor, the ""Kraken"" lawyers Ms Powell and Mr Wood, and Mr Watkins. Then Mr Trump himself. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account Arrests of those who stormed the Capitol continue. But most of the rioters still live in a parallel online universe - a subterranean world filled with alternative facts. They have already come up with fanciful explanations to dismiss Mr Trump'svideo statement, posted on Twitter the day after the riots, in which he acknowledged for the first time that ""a new administration will be inaugurated on 20 January"". He can't possibly be giving up, they contend. Among their new theories - it's not really him in the video but a computer-generated ""deep fake"". Or perhaps the president is being held hostage. Many still believe Mr Trump will prevail. There's no evidence behind any of this, but it does prove one thing. No matter what happens to Donald Trump, the rioters who stormed the US Capitol are not backing down anytime soon.

"Flexing the coronavirus lockdown rules could be fatal, the health secretary has warned as hospital admissions soar. Matt Hancock did not rule out strengthening current restrictions and told the BBC's Andrew Marr the NHS was under ""very serious pressure"". It comes after almost 55,000 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and the number of deaths after a positive test passed 80,000. Scientist Prof Peter Horby warned the UK was in ""the eye of the storm"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the rules were tough but ""may not be tough enough"" and called for the government to hold daily press conferences to avoid ""mixed messages"". The UK recorded another 563 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test on Sunday, down from 1,065 deaths on Saturday. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were also a further 54,940 daily cases. What's still allowed during lockdown? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr ""every time you try to flex the rules that could be fatal"" and said staying at home was the ""most important thing we can do collectively as a society"". The health secretary said he did not want to speculate on whether the government would further strengthen restrictions,after warnings from scientists on Saturday that they may need to be stricter. ""People need to not just follow the letter of the rules but follow the spirit as well and play their part,"" he said. His comments came afterHome Secretary Priti Patel defended police over enforcing lockdown rulesfollowing the case of two women who were fined for going for a walk five miles from their homes -a decision which is now under review. The governmenthas launched a campaigntelling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said that if the virus continued on its current trajectory ""many hospitals will be in real difficulties, and very soon"". In a statement released on Sunday,,externalhe said that unless people started to follow the rules more strictly, emergency patients will have to be turned away from hospitals, causing ""avoidable deaths"". Prof Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there may be ""early signs that something is beginning to bite"" due to the restrictions - but if they did not then stricter measures would be needed. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I really hope people take this very seriously. It was bad in March, it's much worse now. ""We've seen record numbers across the board, record numbers of cases, record numbers of hospitalisations, record numbers of deaths."" This video can not be played Professor Peter Horby explains why the new Covid-19 variant is up to 70% more transmissible Prof Horby said tougher measures might include those during the March lockdown, such as people only being able to exercise once a day and stricter rules about meeting people. ""We are in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky,"" he said. Prof Horby said early signs were encouraging that the vaccines would be effective against the new Covid variants - first identified in the UK and in South Africa - and he did not want people to ""hide under the duvet"". ""We can see the end game now,"" he said. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more ""transmissible"", possibly because each infected individual produces more of the actual virus - sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from serious symptoms but we don't yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be needed to bring the R-number below one and start to reduce the overall size of the pandemic. Mass community testing is to be rolled out this week, the government has said, and the health secretary said around two million people had been vaccinated in the UK, with some 200,000 jabs being given in England daily. Mr Hancock said by autumn every adult in the UK would be offered a vaccine. He said the government was on course to reach its target of 15 million people vaccinated by mid-February, with the opening of seven mass vaccination centres this week likely to increase the rate of jabs. Mr Hancock told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he hoped coronavirus could be treated like seasonal flu with an annual vaccination programme in the future. Prof Horby said the vaccines may have to be updated ""every few years"" as the virus mutates and said it was unlikely the virus would go away completely. ""We're going to have to live with it,"" he said. ""But that may change significantly. ""It may well become more of an endemic virus that's with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths but is not causing the huge disruption that we're seeing now.""

"Wales has received 275,000 doses of the two Covid-19 vaccines to deal with the pandemic. About 70,000 people received a first dose after the first month of the vaccine rollout. The Welsh Government confirmed it has had more than 250,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 25,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The health minister promised a ""really significant step-up"" in the roll-out after opponents criticised its speed. The Pfizer jabs were first administered in early Decemberat seven sites across Wales as part of the UK-wide immunisation programme. Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate' 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs This 82-year-old woman was one of 100 to receives her vaccine at a special clinic in Swansea on Saturday Approximately 1.6% of people were vaccinated up to 3 January - fewer than all other UK nations. In England, about 1.9% of the population had received the first dose, while 2.1% of people in both Scotland and Northern Ireland had received their first jab. The Welsh Government has dismissed criticism it is lagging behind, with health officials saying the new Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would help speed up the programme ""considerably"". Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. The rollout of the Oxford vaccine started on Monday, with 25,000 doses received this week, according to the Welsh Government. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Friday that Wales would receive another 25,000 Oxford doses next week and 80,000 the week after that. When asked how many doses of the Pfizer vaccine Wales had received, he said he could not recall the exact figure but further deliveries had been received ""on the 23rd and the 27th of December"". Pressed on a figure, he said: ""It's the low hundreds of thousands"", adding: ""The Pfizer vaccine has particular challenges in terms of the conditions that it's got to be stored in and in parts of Wales that is a very particular challenge because it is a hard vaccine to transport over long distances to relatively scattered and remote communities. ""But the fact that we've got it and the fact that we're able to use more of it than we originally anticipated means we'll be able to accelerate the use of it over the next couple of weeks."" These were the latest comparative weekly totals - daily updates are promised from this week onwards in Wales On Sunday, the Welsh Government confirmed it had received 25,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the first week but the quantity would increase, allocated to Wales based on a population share on a weekly basis. ""We are confident in the assurances we have been given that this will increase over the next few weeks to around 100,000 per week,"" they said. ""We are delivering all the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine allocated to Wales directly to GPs, other primary care providers and hospitals as soon as it is available."" Conservative MP for the Vale of Clwyd, Dr James Davies, said: ""We all know that the Pfizer vaccine is difficult to transport and store and needs to be stored at -70 degrees, that's understood. ""But the issue is that actually, if you look at the rest of the UK, including very rural areas, they've managed to deal with it... and it is difficult to see why they haven't been in a position to be organised earlier and to ramp-up the delivery."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, called for transparency: ""It is very worrying to find out that we have had in Wales more than 250,000 doses but only a relatively small proportion of that have yet ended up in people's arms, protecting people, because that's what we want to happen."" He has written an open letter to Health Minister Vaughan Gething calling for greater clarity on the vaccine deployment programme, asking for a dashboard of information which would allow the public to track the rollout's progress for themselves, including volume of doses delivered and administered by health board and by the nine priority groups. Dr Olwen Williams, vice-president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, also called on health boards and Welsh Government to publish regular data showing which groups of people have been vaccinated, with patient-facing health workers prioritised over other colleagues. ""I think that would give assurance to people working in the NHS and the population in general, that the programme is progressing as planned,"" she said. All data will be published daily from Monday but Mr Gething conceded that Wales, from last week's figures, was ""slightly behind on the population share and I'm not getting away from that."" He said the race was not ""necessarily against other UK nations"" but against the virus. He also told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementthat, in the next two to three weeks, he expected to see a ""really significant step-up in the delivery of the vaccine"" as more GP practices and community pharmacies help. ""We're going to get through many more people, giving them significant protection with a first vaccine,"" he said. ""And that will mean that we're going to be able to prevent most of the avoidable deaths."" It is hoped the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will speed up the process. By the end of last week, it was being offered to patients aged over 80 at 73 GP practices. More than 100 are expected to be offering the jabs next week, Mr Gething said, ""and then we get into several hundred thereafter and we'll bring community pharmacies on board."" The UK and Scottish governments did not provide the numbers of Pfizer vaccines supplied to England and Scotland. BBC Wales is still waiting for a response from the Northern Irish Executive. Meanwhile, regular rapid testingfor people without coronavirus symptoms will be made availablein England. The Welsh Government said it would evaluate itsmass testing pilots in Merthyr Tydfilandlower Cynon Valley, as well as elsewhere in the UK, to inform its approach to community testing. A spokesman added: ""We have announced regular asymptomatic testing of health and social care workers, in education and daily contact testing in South Wales Police. ""A pilot has also started at the Tata Port Talbot site. We are also exploring other opportunities for regular testing to support critical services.""

"Every adult will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by autumn, Matt Hancock says But right now, people must follow lockdown guidance and stay at home, the health secretary says, as the situation for the NHS is 'very serious' A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were 54,940 new cases reported on Sunday Regular, rapid tests for people without symptoms of Covid-19 will be made available across England from this week Local authorities will be encouraged to target testing to people who cannot work from home during lockdown Global deaths from Covid-19 now stand at 1,928,136, and total cases have reached 89,718,548, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Claire Heald We're going to be wrapping up the live page shortly so here's a reminder of some of the stories we've covered today:  Many thanks for joining us today. Updates were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce and Penny Spiller.  Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey asked of them was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live between a 30 to 45-minute drive from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. Read more here. The government'sSelf Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)was set up to provide financial support to self-employed people who have lost income because of the pandemic. But campaigners say as many as three million self-employed people are not eligible for support. One of those is Cheryl Jones, who served in the Army before retiring to set up her own pet-sitting business. She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that she had not received any financial support from the government since the start of the pandemic when her business closed down. She receives a pension of just over Â£10,000 from the Army and the income from her business was just under Â£10,000. But to be eligible for the SEISS an individual must earn at least 50% of their total income from self-employment. Cheryl said she felt ""let down"" by the government, after being excluded from the scheme. âI am really proud that I served my country and I have
felt disillusioned, depressedâ¦ let down by the government, the country that I
served,"" she said. âI canât even sleep at night, I cry all the time and Iâm
not like that. I am a proud person but this has completely floored me.â The first few weeks of the new year are often when beleaguered couples decide enough is enough and start divorce proceedings. But relationship expert Emma Kenny has warned that this may not be the year to follow that pattern - it could be that weâre projecting our anxieties and frustrations around the coronavirus pandemic on to our partners. Speaking on Mornings, she says: âWe all [project] when weâre in a bad mood; we see our partner and we think that the reason weâre in a bad mood is because of everything they do, as opposed to the way that we feel.â Emma believes we should be wary of contemplating divorce at this moment in time and should view the pandemic as a ""trauma"". âIf weâre doing trauma therapy with anybody, say youâve been burgled or someone has died in your family, we say donât make any big decisions for 6-12 months,"" she says. ""We say that because you need 6-12 months between your trauma ending and you being able to assert where you are and how you feel during that time. âIf youâre divorcing someone because youâre actually unhappy with the world, not your relationship...you might end up feeling even worse in a yearâs time.â President Wavel Ramkalawan was the first to receive the vaccine The Indian Ocean nation of the Seychelles
has begun vaccinating its population, with President Wavel Ramkalawan the first
to receive the jab. Mr Ramkalawan was filmed live on
television receiving the vaccine at a hospital in the capital Victoria, alongside
a number of other public figures. âItâs exactly as if I was getting any
vaccine,â he said, encouraging other citizens to do the same. The archipelago says it is rolling out
some 50,000 doses of the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine, donated by the
United Arab Emirates. Health workers will receive it first,
then citizens over 65, before the rest of the 98,000 population. A further 50,000
doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, donated by India, are expected at the
end of January. The Seychelles has had around 500
recorded cases of the virus, with one death. A further 563 people died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 54,940 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are lower than yesterday's totals for deaths and cases - 1,035 and 59,937 respectively. But figures can be lower than the general trend during the weekend.

More than 2,000 grey seals have been born at Horsey Gap in Norfolk during its annual pupping season. The new arrivals come as police patrol the area to deter visitors during the national lockdown. Seal protection charity, Friends of Horsey Seals, say they have recorded ""well over 2,000"" new seal pups but do not have a complete figure for the season which stretches from November to January. ""We suspended counting when the Covid restrictions made it impossible for our counters, so we don't have a complete figure this year,"" Jane Bowden, a warden and trustee for the charity, told the PA news agency. The charity has hundreds of volunteers from around the country but only local volunteers can help patrol the beach during lockdown, she says. Norfolk Police said it had fined a man and a woman in their 50s who admitted driving more than 120 miles from their home in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire to Horsey tolook at the seal colony on Thursday. Here are some of the coronavirus stories
making the headlines in Europe: When the
coronavirus emerged a year ago, two scientists â Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang in China and Prof Eddie Holmes in Australia - decided to publish the virus's entire genetic code online for anyone to
download. This set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. Two US pharmaceutical
companies â Moderna and Pfizer - began work on an experimental approach to swifter, simpler vaccine production. Chinese
and American scientists collaborated on more than 120 studies. Research centres in Europe, Asia and North America shared data on what
role genetics might play in how sick people get. And trials were carried out to see
whether existing treatments could help. Many scientists
agree that, over the long term, we face a world where the coronavirus is always
present in the global population at some level. That is why, Dr Holmes told the BBC, it is important that
channels of communication between scientists in every country remain open. Politics
can't come into it,"" he says. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less
safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about
fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA."" You can read the full report by BBC's Science Correspondent Victoria Gill here. A further 508 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 55,580, NHS England has said. Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded three deaths of coronavirus patients and 1,877 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to official figures. Scottish Government statistics indicate the daily test positivity rate is 10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. And Public Health Wales have reported another 45 deaths and 1,660 cases. In Northern Ireland, 17 more deaths have been reported in
the past 24 hours, along with 1,112 new cases. Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week,the government has announced. The London borough of Bexley sits on the border of London and Kent - which have both been hard hit by the new variant - and is one of the areas which will be involved in the programme. The borough's director of public health, Dr Anjan Ghosh, said the use of rapid tests was a useful tool to enable quick detection of cases in order to break the chain of transmission. However, he said it was ""not a solution in itself"" and had to be combined with other measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Dr Ghosh told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend Programme there had been strong demand for asymptomatic testing in Bexley, with all the slots available this week already booked up. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm In Sweden a new law has come into force, giving ministers the power to close venues including shops, gyms and cinemas for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The measures were voted through parliament in Stockholm on Friday, after politicians were called back early from their Christmas break. From the start of the pandemic,
Sweden took a different approach to the rest of Europe with a focus on
voluntary guidelines designed to last months rather than weeks; instead of going in and out of lockdown. But this new law allows the government to
introduce much stricter measures as the country battles with some of the
highest coronavirus infection rates in the EU. Ministers have already announced
a ban of more than eight people at bookable private party venues - from dining
halls to common rooms in apartment blocks. And they have said numbers should be
limited in gyms, swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are -
making sure there is at least 10 sq m (107 sq ft) available per person. Local
authorities will have the power to fine businesses that do not follow the rules,
or force them to close. Places of worship are allowed to stay open for communal services in some parts of the UK, despite the latest lockdowns. Unlike in November's lockdown, the government has allowed acts of communal worship to continue in England's churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. Places of worship are open for communal service in Wales, but the Welsh government guidance asks religious bodies to think about alternative ways of holding services - for example broadcasting services without a congregation. Where communal worship is allowed, measures are in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. For example worshippers should keep 2m (6ft) from anyone outside their own household and communal singing should be avoided. Places of worship in mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) are currently closed for either communal services or private prayer. And Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations are to cease public worship until early February. You can read more about the rules for places of worshiphere. From next weekend, India plans to begin rolling out one of the worldâs
most ambitious vaccination programmes. It aims to vaccinate 300 million people on its priority list by
July. That would mean administering 600 million doses overall - around 85 million doses a month. India - which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases globally after the US - also produces 60% of the world's vaccines. The country has pledged to meet its commitments to produce a share of the global supply in the fight against Covid-19, but this could mean its pharmaceutical companies having to produce more than a billion more doses. The BBCâs Reality Check looks at whether India can meet that demand. The UK government needs a long term plan focused on reducing
transmission to avoid future lockdowns, a scientist has said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist from Queen Mary
University, said although vaccines were âcriticalâ, even once the top four
priority groups are vaccinated there will still be many more vulnerable groups
who will not have received a vaccine by mid-February. âItâs really worrying this rhetoric that vaccines are this end
point that will allow us to open up society when the majority of people will
not be protected from infection,â she told the BBC. âWe need a long term plan so that once restrictions are eased
we donât end up exactly in the situation [of] needing yet another lockdown.â She added that this included an effective test-and-trace
system and quarantine measures at borders. Coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" in Scotland, says the deputy first minister as he refused to rule out tougher restrictions. Scotland is facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus, according to John Swinney, whose comments come as the country records its highest death toll so far in the pandemic in the last two days, where 93 Scots died from the virus. Swinney tells Politics Scotland: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet [on Monday] was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" Mr Swinney says Scotland recorded around 130 cases per 100,000 people on Boxing Day, but the figure shot up to 300 just 10 days later. Despite the new measures put in place, Mr Swinney said: ""It doesn't show much sign of abating to any extent. ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" He added: ""We remain open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in Bournemouth. The protest saw dozens of people ""try to march"" through the town centre on Saturday, Dorset Police said. The force's chief constable James Vaughan says: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" At least seven fixed penalty notices were also issued during the event. There were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest, the force says. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" More on this story. Here are some of the coronavirus stories making headlines around the world: Jim ReedBBC News The number of infections recorded in the UK has now been above
the 50,000 mark for 12 consecutive days. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more
deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per
day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the
start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost
certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have
any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more
âtransmissibleâ, possibly because each infected individual produces more of the
actual virus â sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from
serious symptoms but we donât yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual
contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be
needed to bring down the reinfection rate and start to reduce the overall size of
the pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999995

the 50,000 mark for 12 consecutive days. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more
deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per
day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the
start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost
certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have
any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more
âtransmissibleâ, possibly because each infected individual produces more of the
actual virus â sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from

The government'sSelf Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)was set up to provide financial support to self-employed people who have lost income because of the pandemic. But campaigners say as many as three million self-employed people are not eligible for support. One of those is Cheryl Jones, who served in the Army before retiring to set up her own pet-sitting business. She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that she had not received any financial support from the government since the start of the pandemic when her business closed down. She receives a pension of just over Â£10,000 from the Army and the income from her business was just under Â£10,000. But to be eligible for the SEISS an individual must earn at least 50% of their total income from self-employment.

Here are some of the coronavirus stories
making the headlines in Europe: When the
coronavirus emerged a year ago, two scientists â Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang in China and Prof Eddie Holmes in Australia - decided to publish the virus's entire genetic code online for anyone to
download. This set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. Two US pharmaceutical
companies â Moderna and Pfizer - began work on an experimental approach to swifter, simpler vaccine production. Chinese
and American scientists collaborated on more than 120 studies. Research centres in Europe, Asia and North America shared data on what
role genetics might play in how sick people get. And trials were carried out to see
whether existing treatments could help. Many scientists
agree that, over the long term, we face a world where the coronavirus is always
present in the global population at some level. That is why, Dr Holmes told the BBC, it is important that
channels of communication between scientists in every country remain open. Politics
can't come into it,"" he says. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less
safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about
fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA."" You can read the full report by BBC's Science Correspondent Victoria Gill here. A further 508 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 55,580, NHS England has said. Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded three deaths of coronavirus patients and 1,877 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to official figures. Scottish Government statistics indicate the daily test positivity rate is 10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. And Public Health Wales have reported another 45 deaths and 1,660 cases. In Northern Ireland, 17 more deaths have been reported in
the past 24 hours, along with 1,112 new cases. Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week,the government has announced. The London borough of Bexley sits on the border of London and Kent - which have both been hard hit by the new variant - and is one of the areas which will be involved in the programme. The borough's director of public health, Dr Anjan Ghosh, said the use of rapid tests was a useful tool to enable quick detection of cases in order to break the chain of transmission. However, he said it was ""not a solution in itself"" and had to be combined with other measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Dr Ghosh told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend Programme there had been strong demand for asymptomatic testing in Bexley, with all the slots available this week already booked up. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm In Sweden a new law has come into force, giving ministers the power to close venues including shops, gyms and cinemas for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The measures were voted through parliament in Stockholm on Friday, after politicians were called back early from their Christmas break. From the start of the pandemic,
Sweden took a different approach to the rest of Europe with a focus on
voluntary guidelines designed to last months rather than weeks; instead of going in and out of lockdown. But this new law allows the government to
introduce much stricter measures as the country battles with some of the
highest coronavirus infection rates in the EU. Ministers have already announced
a ban of more than eight people at bookable private party venues - from dining
halls to common rooms in apartment blocks. And they have said numbers should be
limited in gyms, swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are -
making sure there is at least 10 sq m (107 sq ft) available per person. Local
authorities will have the power to fine businesses that do not follow the rules,
or force them to close. Places of worship are allowed to stay open for communal services in some parts of the UK, despite the latest lockdowns. Unlike in November's lockdown, the government has allowed acts of communal worship to continue in England's churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. Places of worship are open for communal service in Wales, but the Welsh government guidance asks religious bodies to think about alternative ways of holding services - for example broadcasting services without a congregation. Where communal worship is allowed, measures are in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. For example worshippers should keep 2m (6ft) from anyone outside their own household and communal singing should be avoided. Places of worship in mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) are currently closed for either communal services or private prayer. And Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations are to cease public worship until early February. You can read more about the rules for places of worshiphere. From next weekend, India plans to begin rolling out one of the worldâs
most ambitious vaccination programmes. It aims to vaccinate 300 million people on its priority list by
July. That would mean administering 600 million doses overall - around 85 million doses a month. India - which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases globally after the US - also produces 60% of the world's vaccines. The country has pledged to meet its commitments to produce a share of the global supply in the fight against Covid-19, but this could mean its pharmaceutical companies having to produce more than a billion more doses. The BBCâs Reality Check looks at whether India can meet that demand. The UK government needs a long term plan focused on reducing
transmission to avoid future lockdowns, a scientist has said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist from Queen Mary
University, said although vaccines were âcriticalâ, even once the top four
priority groups are vaccinated there will still be many more vulnerable groups
who will not have received a vaccine by mid-February. âItâs really worrying this rhetoric that vaccines are this end
point that will allow us to open up society when the majority of people will
not be protected from infection,â she told the BBC. âWe need a long term plan so that once restrictions are eased
we donât end up exactly in the situation [of] needing yet another lockdown.â She added that this included an effective test-and-trace
system and quarantine measures at borders. Coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" in Scotland, says the deputy first minister as he refused to rule out tougher restrictions. Scotland is facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus, according to John Swinney, whose comments come as the country records its highest death toll so far in the pandemic in the last two days, where 93 Scots died from the virus. Swinney tells Politics Scotland: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet [on Monday] was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" Mr Swinney says Scotland recorded around 130 cases per 100,000 people on Boxing Day, but the figure shot up to 300 just 10 days later. Despite the new measures put in place, Mr Swinney said: ""It doesn't show much sign of abating to any extent. ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" He added: ""We remain open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in Bournemouth. The protest saw dozens of people ""try to march"" through the town centre on Saturday, Dorset Police said. The force's chief constable James Vaughan says: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" At least seven fixed penalty notices were also issued during the event. There were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest, the force says.

"Every adult will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by autumn, Matt Hancock says But right now, people must follow lockdown guidance and stay at home, the health secretary says, as the situation for the NHS is 'very serious' A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were 54,940 new cases reported on Sunday Regular, rapid tests for people without symptoms of Covid-19 will be made available across England from this week Local authorities will be encouraged to target testing to people who cannot work from home during lockdown Global deaths from Covid-19 now stand at 1,928,136, and total cases have reached 89,718,548, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Claire Heald We're going to be wrapping up the live page shortly so here's a reminder of some of the stories we've covered today:  Many thanks for joining us today. Updates were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce and Penny Spiller.  Kay and Kenneth Hayward said they felt the journey asked of them was too unsafe People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live between a 30 to 45-minute drive from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. Read more here. The government'sSelf Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS)was set up to provide financial support to self-employed people who have lost income because of the pandemic. But campaigners say as many as three million self-employed people are not eligible for support. One of those is Cheryl Jones, who served in the Army before retiring to set up her own pet-sitting business. She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that she had not received any financial support from the government since the start of the pandemic when her business closed down. She receives a pension of just over Â£10,000 from the Army and the income from her business was just under Â£10,000. But to be eligible for the SEISS an individual must earn at least 50% of their total income from self-employment. Cheryl said she felt ""let down"" by the government, after being excluded from the scheme. âI am really proud that I served my country and I have
felt disillusioned, depressedâ¦ let down by the government, the country that I
served,"" she said. âI canât even sleep at night, I cry all the time and Iâm
not like that. I am a proud person but this has completely floored me.â The first few weeks of the new year are often when beleaguered couples decide enough is enough and start divorce proceedings. But relationship expert Emma Kenny has warned that this may not be the year to follow that pattern - it could be that weâre projecting our anxieties and frustrations around the coronavirus pandemic on to our partners. Speaking on Mornings, she says: âWe all [project] when weâre in a bad mood; we see our partner and we think that the reason weâre in a bad mood is because of everything they do, as opposed to the way that we feel.â Emma believes we should be wary of contemplating divorce at this moment in time and should view the pandemic as a ""trauma"". âIf weâre doing trauma therapy with anybody, say youâve been burgled or someone has died in your family, we say donât make any big decisions for 6-12 months,"" she says. ""We say that because you need 6-12 months between your trauma ending and you being able to assert where you are and how you feel during that time. âIf youâre divorcing someone because youâre actually unhappy with the world, not your relationship...you might end up feeling even worse in a yearâs time.â President Wavel Ramkalawan was the first to receive the vaccine The Indian Ocean nation of the Seychelles
has begun vaccinating its population, with President Wavel Ramkalawan the first
to receive the jab. Mr Ramkalawan was filmed live on
television receiving the vaccine at a hospital in the capital Victoria, alongside
a number of other public figures. âItâs exactly as if I was getting any
vaccine,â he said, encouraging other citizens to do the same. The archipelago says it is rolling out
some 50,000 doses of the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine, donated by the
United Arab Emirates. Health workers will receive it first,
then citizens over 65, before the rest of the 98,000 population. A further 50,000
doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, donated by India, are expected at the
end of January. The Seychelles has had around 500
recorded cases of the virus, with one death. A further 563 people died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 54,940 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are lower than yesterday's totals for deaths and cases - 1,035 and 59,937 respectively. But figures can be lower than the general trend during the weekend. Officers descended on Oldbury Court in Bristol at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday A teenager has been arrested and 38 fines issued over suspected plans to hold an illegal rave in Bristol. ""Bristol Freerave"" was promoted at an undisclosed location on social media but ""following intelligence"" officers descended on Oldbury Court in Fishponds at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday. The force said a ""significant number of people"" were in the area and 38 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid regulations were issued. A man, 19, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. He has since been released under investigation. Read more. More than 2,000 grey seals have been born at Horsey Gap in Norfolk during its annual pupping season. The new arrivals come as police patrol the area to deter visitors during the national lockdown. Seal protection charity, Friends of Horsey Seals, say they have recorded ""well over 2,000"" new seal pups but do not have a complete figure for the season which stretches from November to January. ""We suspended counting when the Covid restrictions made it impossible for our counters, so we don't have a complete figure this year,"" Jane Bowden, a warden and trustee for the charity, told the PA news agency. The charity has hundreds of volunteers from around the country but only local volunteers can help patrol the beach during lockdown, she says. Norfolk Police said it had fined a man and a woman in their 50s who admitted driving more than 120 miles from their home in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire to Horsey tolook at the seal colony on Thursday. Here are some of the coronavirus stories
making the headlines in Europe: When the
coronavirus emerged a year ago, two scientists â Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang in China and Prof Eddie Holmes in Australia - decided to publish the virus's entire genetic code online for anyone to
download. This set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. Two US pharmaceutical
companies â Moderna and Pfizer - began work on an experimental approach to swifter, simpler vaccine production. Chinese
and American scientists collaborated on more than 120 studies. Research centres in Europe, Asia and North America shared data on what
role genetics might play in how sick people get. And trials were carried out to see
whether existing treatments could help. Many scientists
agree that, over the long term, we face a world where the coronavirus is always
present in the global population at some level. That is why, Dr Holmes told the BBC, it is important that
channels of communication between scientists in every country remain open. Politics
can't come into it,"" he says. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less
safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about
fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA."" You can read the full report by BBC's Science Correspondent Victoria Gill here. A further 508 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 55,580, NHS England has said. Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded three deaths of coronavirus patients and 1,877 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to official figures. Scottish Government statistics indicate the daily test positivity rate is 10%, up from 8.7% on Saturday, when 1,865 positive cases were recorded. And Public Health Wales have reported another 45 deaths and 1,660 cases. In Northern Ireland, 17 more deaths have been reported in
the past 24 hours, along with 1,112 new cases. Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week,the government has announced. The London borough of Bexley sits on the border of London and Kent - which have both been hard hit by the new variant - and is one of the areas which will be involved in the programme. The borough's director of public health, Dr Anjan Ghosh, said the use of rapid tests was a useful tool to enable quick detection of cases in order to break the chain of transmission. However, he said it was ""not a solution in itself"" and had to be combined with other measures such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Dr Ghosh told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend Programme there had been strong demand for asymptomatic testing in Bexley, with all the slots available this week already booked up. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm In Sweden a new law has come into force, giving ministers the power to close venues including shops, gyms and cinemas for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The measures were voted through parliament in Stockholm on Friday, after politicians were called back early from their Christmas break. From the start of the pandemic,
Sweden took a different approach to the rest of Europe with a focus on
voluntary guidelines designed to last months rather than weeks; instead of going in and out of lockdown. But this new law allows the government to
introduce much stricter measures as the country battles with some of the
highest coronavirus infection rates in the EU. Ministers have already announced
a ban of more than eight people at bookable private party venues - from dining
halls to common rooms in apartment blocks. And they have said numbers should be
limited in gyms, swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are -
making sure there is at least 10 sq m (107 sq ft) available per person. Local
authorities will have the power to fine businesses that do not follow the rules,
or force them to close. Places of worship are allowed to stay open for communal services in some parts of the UK, despite the latest lockdowns. Unlike in November's lockdown, the government has allowed acts of communal worship to continue in England's churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, temples and meeting rooms. Places of worship are open for communal service in Wales, but the Welsh government guidance asks religious bodies to think about alternative ways of holding services - for example broadcasting services without a congregation. Where communal worship is allowed, measures are in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. For example worshippers should keep 2m (6ft) from anyone outside their own household and communal singing should be avoided. Places of worship in mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) are currently closed for either communal services or private prayer. And Northern Ireland's main Christian denominations are to cease public worship until early February. You can read more about the rules for places of worshiphere. From next weekend, India plans to begin rolling out one of the worldâs
most ambitious vaccination programmes. It aims to vaccinate 300 million people on its priority list by
July. That would mean administering 600 million doses overall - around 85 million doses a month. India - which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases globally after the US - also produces 60% of the world's vaccines. The country has pledged to meet its commitments to produce a share of the global supply in the fight against Covid-19, but this could mean its pharmaceutical companies having to produce more than a billion more doses. The BBCâs Reality Check looks at whether India can meet that demand. The UK government needs a long term plan focused on reducing
transmission to avoid future lockdowns, a scientist has said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist from Queen Mary
University, said although vaccines were âcriticalâ, even once the top four
priority groups are vaccinated there will still be many more vulnerable groups
who will not have received a vaccine by mid-February. âItâs really worrying this rhetoric that vaccines are this end
point that will allow us to open up society when the majority of people will
not be protected from infection,â she told the BBC. âWe need a long term plan so that once restrictions are eased
we donât end up exactly in the situation [of] needing yet another lockdown.â She added that this included an effective test-and-trace
system and quarantine measures at borders. Coronavirus does not show much sign of ""abating"" in Scotland, says the deputy first minister as he refused to rule out tougher restrictions. Scotland is facing ""a very alarming situation"" with the virus, according to John Swinney, whose comments come as the country records its highest death toll so far in the pandemic in the last two days, where 93 Scots died from the virus. Swinney tells Politics Scotland: ""I don't think I'm revealing a state secret when I say that the debate within cabinet [on Monday] was not whether we were going too far but whether we were going far enough."" Mr Swinney says Scotland recorded around 130 cases per 100,000 people on Boxing Day, but the figure shot up to 300 just 10 days later. Despite the new measures put in place, Mr Swinney said: ""It doesn't show much sign of abating to any extent. ""We're seeing case numbers which are hovering around 2,000 per day... so we've got an accelerating situation on our hands and we have to constantly review whether more restrictions are required."" He added: ""We remain open to considering further restrictions if they are necessary."" Three people have been arrested on suspicion of breaching Covid-19 regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in Bournemouth. The protest saw dozens of people ""try to march"" through the town centre on Saturday, Dorset Police said. The force's chief constable James Vaughan says: ""I condemn the actions of these selfish individuals who knowingly flouted the lockdown restrictions."" At least seven fixed penalty notices were also issued during the event. There were ""repeated attempts"" to engage with the organisers to stop the planned protest, the force says. Mr Vaughan added: ""Our county is gripped with infections and yet these irresponsible individuals have ignored what is being asked of them and have left their homes to protest. Shame on them."" More on this story. Here are some of the coronavirus stories making headlines around the world: Jim ReedBBC News The number of infections recorded in the UK has now been above
the 50,000 mark for 12 consecutive days. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more
deaths. The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per
day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the
start of December. The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost
certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have
any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more
âtransmissibleâ, possibly because each infected individual produces more of the
actual virus â sometimes referred to as the viral load. Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from
serious symptoms but we donât yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual
contracting the virus and passing it on to others. Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be
needed to bring down the reinfection rate and start to reduce the overall size of
the pandemic. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.6780922
"""Absurd"" council tax rises should be scrapped to ease the pressure on family budgets, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Local authorities in England will be able to raise council tax by 5% from April, with 3% used to top up adult social care budgets. Sir Keir said this meant those living in a band D property could see bills rise by an average of Â£90. He added that the prime minister should provide extra funding to councils. But the government says the rise in council tax bills, plus extra money from central government, will ensure a real-terms increase in support for local services. Council tax to rise by up to 5% next year Council tax 'likely to rise' after Sunak review Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Sir Keirwrote in the Sunday Telegraph:,external""It is absurd that during the deepest recession in 300 years, at the very time millions are worried about the future of their jobs and how they will make ends meet, Boris Johnson and [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak are forcing local government to hike up council tax. ""The prime minister said he would do 'whatever is necessary' to support local authorities in providing vital services - he needs to make good on that promise."" Sir Keir urged Mr Johnson to ""give families the security they need"" by dropping the tax increase. He said families had been treated as an ""afterthought"" by the government during the pandemic, adding that Labour would become the ""party of the family"" under his leadership. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""Council tax plays an important role in helping fund the frontline services needed to respond to the pandemic. ""Our approach strikes a balance between allowing local authorities to address service pressures and ensuring local residents have the final say on excessive increases."" A Â£500m fund to support people struggling with finances meant councils could ""cut bills further for some of the most vulnerable households"", they added, while a Â£7.2bn support package would help meet ""the major Covid-19 service pressures in their local area"". The chancellor's Spending Review in November set out the cost to the UK economy so far of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Sunak warned the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun,with lasting damage to growth and jobs. Interviewed on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said there was no scope for a ""major renegotiation"" of the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, but added that there were ""bits already that need to be improved on"". And, asked about the possibility of another Scottish referendum on independence from the UK, he said that a ""further, divisive"" vote was not ""the way forward"". ""But I do accept that the status quo isn't working"", Sir Keir added. ""I don't accept the argument that the status quo isn't working, the next thing you do is go to a referendum."" The prime minister has said such a vote - last held in 2014 - should be a ""once-in-a-generation"" event. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum should take place.

"Bez in training for his new exercise classes in a park in Manchester Happy Mondays star Bez is to launch his own lockdown fitness classes to inspire the nation like Joe Wicks. The former maraca-shaking dancer, 56, wants torival Joe Wickswith his online YouTube classes ""Get Buzzin' With Bez"" to be launched on 17 January. Bez, whose on-stage ""freaky dancing"" made him an icon of the 'Madchester' music scene, has admitted he also wants to budge his own lockdown bulge. He won Celebrity Big Brother in 2005 and even madea bid to become an MP. Maraca-shaking dancer Bez and lead singer Shaun Ryder in 1989 Bez, whose real name is Mark Berry, will be shown being trained in the fitness classes rather than acting as the instructor himself. He said: ""I'd like to think I'm somewhere between Joe Wicks and Mr Motivator. ""I've started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips, and I can't stop eating chocolate. ""Last lockdown I got unfit, fat, lazy and into some seriously bad eating habits. Bez being put through his paces with a personal trainer ""This year, this lockdown, I need to sort it out sharpish."" He said that people can join him on ""on this mad  journey or just sit on the sofa and have a good laugh at me"". Bez said he has ""started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips"" The former dancer added: ""At the very least, I know I'll be making people smile, at best I'll be helping people get fit and mentally happier alongside me."" The Happy Mondays, along with bands like The Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets, spearheaded the indie music 'Madchester' scene of the late 80s and early 90s. Bez dancing with his maraca on BBC One's Top of the Pops as the band perform Step On in 1989 Bez's bug-eyed dance routines were said to have inspired the group's song Freaky Dancin' and made him one of the best-known members of the group, alongside frontman Shaun Ryder.

"More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic, official figures have shown. A further 1,035 deaths in the UK were reported on Saturday, taking the total by that measure to 80,868. The number of daily cases of people who tested positive for coronavirus increased by 59,937. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University.,external It is the fourth day in a row that the UK has reported more than 1,000 daily deaths. It comes as scientists advising the government have warned that lockdown measures in England need to be stricter to achieve the same impact as the March shutdown. Ministers have launched a new campaignurging people to act like they have the virus. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99,received Covid-19 vaccinationson Saturday. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? The Office for National Statistics recently estimated as many as one in 50 people in England had coronavirus between 27 December and 2 January, while in London it was one in 30. On Friday, mayor Sadiq Khan saidthe spread of Covid in the capital was ""out of control"". Official figures from Public Health England showed London had the highest regional case rate in the UK, exceeding 1,000 per 100,000 people. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can only go out for essential reasons. Similar measures are in place across most of Scotland, in Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the current rules were ""still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus"". He said the new variant of Covid was around 50% more infectious compared to the virus that infected people last March. ""That means that if we were to achieve the same result as we got in March we would have to have a stricter lockdown, and it (the current regime) is not stricter,"" he added. The professor of health psychology at University College London also told the BBC more children were going to school, compared to during the first lockdown. He said schools were ""a very important seed of community infection"". More children are at school, after the Department for Education widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils allowed to attend. Attendance rates have risen to 50% in some places. Prof Susan Michie, who is also a member of Sage, said the spread of the new, more infectious variant meant current restrictions were ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said, in comparison to the first lockdown in spring 2020, more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's statutory sick pay system was ""not fit for purpose for a pandemic"" and more effective measures to encourage people to isolate were needed.

"Parts of the fuselage of the plane have apparently been recovered ""Black boxes"" from a passenger plane that crashed into the sea soon after take-off in Indonesia on Saturday have been located, officials say. Navy divers are confident that they will be able retrieve the two flight recorders when the search operation resumes on Monday. Aircraft parts and human remains have been found. The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 was carrying 62 people when it vanished from radar on its journey to Borneo. ""We have located the position of the black boxes, both of them,"" said Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, quoted by AFP earlier on Sunday. ""Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them."" The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or black boxes as they are often called, store data about planes. They can provide vital information in air accident investigations. This video can not be played What's in a plane's black box flight recorder? Investigators are analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among crash missing A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 The search operation has been suspended for the night but is due to resume on Monday morning. However, there appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Debris believed to belong to the Sriwijaya Air flight that disappeared shortly after take-off from Jakarta A spokesman for the Jakarta police, Yusri Yunus, said two bags had been received from the search and rescue agency. ""The first bag contained passengers' properties, another bag contained body parts,"" he told reporters, adding: ""We are still identifying these findings."" Police are asking families of the victims to provide DNA samples and dental records to help identify the remains. Indonesian investigators inspect an item they believe could belong to the missing plane The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. The aircraft did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously for newsat the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Afrida's 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion was on the flight. Angga, a merchant seaman, had been told to go to Pontianak because his ship was damaged, she said. Just a week ago he had become a father. ""If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,"" she told BBC Indonesia. Family members of missing passengers wait for news at Pontianak airport, Indonesia Meanwhile relatives of the plane's captain, Afwan, a former air force pilot, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, described him as a devout Muslim and a ""very good man"". ""He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,"" says his nephew Ferza Mahardhika. ""I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family."" According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash.

"Many were taken by surprise by the events in Washington, but to those who closely follow conspiracy and extreme right groups online, the warning signs were all there. At 02:21 Eastern Standard Time on election night, President Trump walked onto a stage set up in the East Room of the White House and declared victory. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."" His speech came an hour after he'd tweeted: ""They are trying to steal the election"". He hadn't won. There was no victory to steal. But to many of his most fervent supporters, these facts didn't matter, and still don't. Sixty five days later, a motley coalition of rioters stormed the US Capitol building. They included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, members of ""Stop the Steal"" groups, far-right activists, online trolls and others. On Friday 8 January -  some 48 hours after the Washington riots - Twitter began a purge of some of the most influential pro-Trump accounts that had been pushing conspiracies and urging direct action to overturn the election result. Then came the big one - Mr Trump himself. The president was permanently banned from tweeting to his more than 88 million followers ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"". The violence in Washington shocked the world and seemed to catch the authorities off guard. But for anyone who had been carefully watching the unfolding story - online and on the streets of American cities - it came as no surprise. The idea of a rigged election was seeded by the president in speeches and on Twitter, months before the vote. On election day, the rumors started just as Americans were going to the polls. A video of a Republican poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station went viral. It was a genuine error, caused by confusion about the rules. The man was laterallowed into the stationto observe the count. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. But it became the first of many videos, images, graphics and claims that went viral in the days that followed, giving rise to a hashtag: #StopTheSteal. The message behind it was clear - Mr Trump had won a landslide victory, but dark forces in the establishment ""deep state"" had stolen it from him. In the early hours of Wednesday 4 November, while votes were still being counted and three days before the US networks called the election for Joe Biden, President Trump claimed victory, alleging ""a fraud on the American public"". Mr Trump did not provide any evidence to back up his claims.Studies carried out for previous US electionshave shown that voter fraud is extremely rare. By mid-afternoon a Facebook group called ""Stop the Steal"" was created and quickly became one of the fastest-growing in the platform's history. By Thursday morning, it had added more than 300,000 members. Many of the posts focused on unsubstantiated allegations of mass voter fraud, including manufactured claims that thousands of dead people had voted and that voting machines had somehow been programmed to flip votes from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. 'Stop the steal': The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive US Election 2020: Trump claims about Dominion machines fact-checked But some of the posts were more alarming, speaking of the need for a ""civil war"" or ""revolution"". By Thursday afternoon, Facebook had taken down Stop the Steal, but not before it had generated nearly half a million comments, shares, likes, and reactions. Dozens of other groups quickly sprang up in its place. The idea of a stolen election continued to spread online and take hold. Soon, a dedicated Stop the Steal website was launched in a bid to register ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote"". On Saturday 7 November, major news organisations declared that Joe Biden had won the election. In Democratic strongholds, throngs of people took to the streets to celebrate. But the reaction online from Mr Trump's most ardent supporters was one of anger and defiance. They planned a rally in Washington DC for the following Saturday, dubbed the Million MAGA (Make America Great Again) March. Trump tweeted that he might try to stop by the demonstration and ""say hello"". Previous pro-Trump rallies in Washington had failed to attract large crowds. But thousands gathered at Freedom Plaza that sunny morning. One extremism researchercalled it,externalthe ""debut of the pro-Trump insurgency"". As Trump's motorcade drove through the city, supporters screaming with delight rushed to catch a glimpse of the president, who beamed at them wearing a red MAGA hat. While mainstream conservative figures were present, the event was dominated by far-right groups. Dozens of members of the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group Proud Boys, who have repeatedly been involved in violent street protests and were among those who would later break into the US Capitol, joined the march. Militia groups, far-right media figures and promoters of conspiracy theories were also there. Capitol riots: Who broke into the building? US Election 2020: Who are the Proud Boys - and who are antifa? As night fell, clashes between Trump supporters and counter-protesters broke out, including a brawl about five blocks from the White House. The violence - although largely contained by police on this occasion - was a clear sign of things to come. By now, President Trump and his legal team had invested their hopes in dozens of legal cases. Although a number of courts had already dismissed fraud allegations, many in the pro-Trump online world became fascinated with two lawyers with close ties to the president - Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood. Ms Powell and Mr Wood promised they were preparing cases of voter fraud so comprehensive that when released, they would destroy the case for Mr Biden having won the presidency. Watch Aleem Maqbool's film America: Storming the Capitol, in which he examines the question - how safe is American democracy? Ms Powell, 65, a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor, told Fox News that the effort would ""release the Kraken"" - a reference to a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies. The ""Kraken"" quickly became an internet meme, representing sprawling, unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud. Ms Powell and Mr Wood became heroes to followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory - who believe President Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state made up of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. What is QAnon? What is the 'Kraken' conspiracy? The lawyers became a conduit between the president and his most conspiracy-minded supporters - a number of whom ended up inside the Capitol on 6 January. Ms Powell and Mr Wood were successful in whipping up sound and fury online, but their legal efforts came to nothing. When they released almost 200 pages of documents in late November, it became clear thattheir lawsuitconsisted predominantly of conspiracy theories and debunked allegations that had already been rejected by dozens of courts. The filings contained simple legal errors - and basic misspellings and typos. Still, the meme lived on. The terms ""Kraken"" and ""Release the Kraken"" were used more than a million times on Twitter before the Capitol riot. As courts rejected Mr Trump's legal cases, far-right activists increasingly targeted election workers and officials. Death threats were made against a Georgia election worker, and Republican officials in the state - including Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the official in charge of the state's voting systems, Gabriel Sterling - were branded ""traitors"" online. Mr Sterling issued an emotional and prescient warning to the president in a press conference on 1 December. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right,"" he said. In Michigan in early December, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, had just finished trimming her Christmas tree with her four-year-old son when she heard a commotion outside her Detroit home. About 30 protesters with banners stood outside, shouting ""Stop the steal!"" through megaphones. ""Benson, you are a villain,"" one person yelled. ""You're a threat to democracy!"" called another. One of the demonstrators live-streamed the protest on Facebook, stating that her group was ""not going away"". It was just one of a rash of protests targeting people involved in the vote. In Georgia, a constant stream of Trump supporters drove past Mr Raffensperger's home, honking their horns. His wife received threats of sexual violence. In Arizona, demonstrators gathered outside of the home of Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, at one point warning: ""We are watching you."" On 11 December,the Supreme Court rejectedan attempt by the state of Texas to throw out election results. As the president's legal and political windows continued to close, the language in pro-Trump online circles became increasingly violent. On 12 December, a second Stop the Steal rally was held in the capital. Once again, thousands attended, and once again prominent far-right activists, QAnon supporters, fringe MAGA groups and militia movements were among the demonstrators. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security advisor, likened the protesters to the biblical soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho. This echoed the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. Nick Fuentes, the leader of Groypers, a far-right movement that targets Republican politicians and figures they deem too moderate, told the crowd: ""We are going to destroy the GOP!"" The march once againturned violent. Then two days later,the Electoral College certifiedMr Biden's victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office. On online platforms, supporters were becoming resigned to the view that all legal avenues were dead ends, and only direct action could save the Trump presidency. Since election day, alongside Mr Flynn, Ms Powell and Mr Wood, a new figure had rapidly gained prominence among pro-Trump circles online. Ron Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins, the man behind 8chan and 8kun - message boards filled with extreme language and views, violence and extreme sexual content. They gave rise to the QAnon movement. In a series of viral tweets on 17 December, Ron Watkins suggested President Trump should follow the example of Roman leader Julius Caesar, and capitalise on ""fierce loyalty of the military"" in order to ""restore the Republic"". Ron Watkins encouraged his more than 500,000 followers to make #CrossTheRubicon a Twitter trend, referring to the moment when Caesar launched a civil war by crossing the Rubicon river in 49BC. The hashtag was also used by more mainstream figures - including the chairwoman of Arizona Republican Party,Kelli Ward,external. In a separate tweet, Ron Watkins said Mr Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act, which empowers the president to deploy the military and federal forces. Mr Trump met Ms Powell, Mr Flynn and others at a strategy meeting at the White House the following day, 18 December. During the meeting, according to the New York Times, Mr Flynn called on Mr Trump toimpose martial law,externaland deploy the military to ""rerun"" the election. The meeting further stoked online chatter about ""war"" and ""revolution"" in far-right circles. Many came to see the joint session of Congress on 6 January, normally a formality, as a last roll of the dice. A wishful story began to take hold among QAnon and some MAGA supporters. They hoped that Vice-President Mike Pence, who was set to preside over the 6 January ceremony, would ignore the electoral college votes. The president, they said, would then deploy the military to quell any unrest, order the mass arrest of the ""deep state cabal"" who had rigged the election and send them to Guantanamo Bay military prison. Back in the land of reality, none of this was remotely feasible. But it launched a movement for ""patriot caravans"" to organise ride shares to help transport thousands from around the country to Washington DC on 6 January. Long processions of vehicles flying Trump flags and sometimes towing elaborately decorated trailers gathered in car parks in cities including Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""We are on our way,"" one caravaner posted on Twitter with a picture of about two dozen supporters. At an Ikea parking lot in North Carolina, another man showed off his truck. ""The flags are a little tattered - we'll call them battle flags now,"" he said. As it became clear that Mr Pence and other key Republicans would follow the law and allow Congress to certify Mr Biden's win, the language towards them became vicious. ""Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason,"" Mr Wood tweeted. ""He will face execution by firing squad."" Online discussion reached boiling point. References to firearms, war and violence were rife on self-styled ""free speech""social platformssuch as Gab and Parler, which are popular with Trump supporters, as well as on other sites. In Proud Boys groups, where members had once supported police, some turned against authorities, whom they deemed to no longer be on their side. Hundreds of posts on a popular pro-Trump site, TheDonald, openly discussed plans to cross barricades, carry firearms and other weapons to the march in defiance of Washington's strict gun laws. There was open chatter about storming the Capitol and arresting ""treasonous"" members of Congress. On Wednesday 6 January, Mr Trump addressed a crowd of thousands at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, for more than an hour. Early on he encouraged supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard"", but he ended with a warning. ""We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. ""So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ¦ and we're going to the Capitol."" To some observers, the potential for violence that day was clear from the outset. Michael Chertoff, former secretary of homeland security under President George W Bush, blamed the Capitol Police, who reportedly turned down offers of assistance from the much larger National Guard ahead of time. He characterised it as ""the worst failure of a police force I can think of"". ""I think it was a very foreseeable potential negative turn of events,"" Mr Chertoff said. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol ""To be blunt, it was obvious. If you read the newspaper and were awake, you understood that you've got a lot of people who have been convinced there was a fraudulent election. Some of them are extremists, and violent. Some of the groups openly said, 'Bring your guns'."" Still, many Americans were astonished by Wednesday's scenes, like James Clark, a 68-year-old Republican from Virginia. ""I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this,""he toldthe BBC. But the signs were there for weeks. A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups were convinced that the election was stolen. Online, they repeatedly talked about arming themselves, and violence. Perhaps the authorities didn't think their posts were serious, or specific enough to investigate. They now face pointed questions. For Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January, Mr Chertoff is expecting a ""much stronger showing"" by security services than last Wednesday night. But that hasn't stopped many on extreme platforms calling for further violence and disruption on the day. There are questions, too, for the major social media platforms, which enabled conspiracy theories to reach millions of people. Late on Friday, Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr Flynn, the former Trump advisor, the ""Kraken"" lawyers Ms Powell and Mr Wood, and Mr Watkins. Then Mr Trump himself. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account Arrests of those who stormed the Capitol continue. But most of the rioters still live in a parallel online universe - a subterranean world filled with alternative facts. They have already come up with fanciful explanations to dismiss Mr Trump'svideo statement, posted on Twitter the day after the riots, in which he acknowledged for the first time that ""a new administration will be inaugurated on 20 January"". He can't possibly be giving up, they contend. Among their new theories - it's not really him in the video but a computer-generated ""deep fake"". Or perhaps the president is being held hostage. Many still believe Mr Trump will prevail. There's no evidence behind any of this, but it does prove one thing. No matter what happens to Donald Trump, the rioters who stormed the US Capitol are not backing down anytime soon.

"The number of people being treated in Scotland's hospitals for coronavirus has reached another record daily high. Latest Scottish government figures show a total of 1,596 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid. This is up from Friday's figure of 1,530 patients. The deaths of a further 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, the same tally as Friday which was the highest daily figure of the pandemic. It is the second day in a row there has been a record figure for Covid hospital patients. Of the 1,596 people in hospital, a total of 109 are in intensive care, up seven on Friday's figure. Tesco staff 'devastated' at deaths of two colleagues Police warn against lockdown protest Where are the latest cases? National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said Scotland's hospitals were ""very busy and fragile"" but coping so far. He said: ""People should not be worried we have reached capacity but the best way of getting those numbers down is to reduce the prevalence of the virus."" Prof Leitch said the NHS could create more intensive care capacity if needed but ""all of that has a cost in what we won't be able to do"" elsewhere in the health service. TheNHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgowcan be used to care for the sickest of Covid patients if the spike in admissions continues, but officials are trying to avoid this ""if we can manage without it"", Prof Leitch added. This is because it is better for patients and staff for Covid patients to be in traditional intensive care units, he explained. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the latest Covid figures as ""a big concern"".

"Ben Jackson said the closure of the farm's bulk-buyers like hotels and schools has left thousands of eggs unsold A fall in bulk egg orders due to the lockdown could lead to chickens being culled, a poultry-farmer has warned. Fluffetts Farm near Fordingbridge had been supplying free range eggs to 350 Hampshire schools, but orders stopped when schools suddenly closed. Farm owner, Ben Jackson said: ""If you can't sell the eggs you can't still keep feeding the chickens and therefore something has to give."" He said he hoped to work out a local delivery system to avoid culling birds. Mr Jackson, who has been selling some of the surplus eggs off on social media, has more than 13,000 chickens laying 12,000 eggs each day. The cancellation of his school orders has left him with about 4,000 spare eggs a day. The farm has also been hit by restaurants and pubs closing again. The farm has a surplus of about 4,000 eggs each day from its 13,000 chickens He said: ""If we can't find a home for the eggs the worst-case scenario is that we may have to look to get rid of some of our chickens, but that's what we're trying to avoid. ""Other chicken farmers are in the same situation - they are talking about potentially having to cull birds in the next week or so - it's not a decision that anyone wants to make. ""We just want to get through this dark time - we're just taking it a day at time."" Chickens at the farm are currently in a bird lockdown. Since 14 Decemberstrict biosecurity regulationshave been in place following a number of outbreak of avian influenza throughout England. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Bernard Thomas was interviewed by BBC Wales at the time of the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster A survivor of the Aberfan disaster has died after contracting Covid-19. As a nine-year-old Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school after one of the biggest tragedies in Welsh history. A total of 144 people were killed in the disaster on 21 October, 1966, after thousands of tonnes of coal slurry slid from a tip. Of those 116 were primary school pupils. Later Bernard was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. He told S4C he ""still heard the sounds of children screaming."" Aberfan disaster: First photographer on scene retires Aberfan disaster: Teacher who rescued pupils dies aged 86 Teacher who led Aberfan pupils to safety dies, aged 75 Paying tribute to Mr Thomas, 63, who died on Wednesday, his brother Andrew told BBC's Newyddion: ""Bernard was a real character and his death has come as a shock to us as a family and the community of Aberfan."" ""We can't be sure where he caught Covid, but he had an eye appointment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 21 December. ""A few days later, he became ill and at Prince Charles Hospital, he tested positive for Covid-19."" ""Although he had been receiving oxygen through a mask, we spoke regularly on the phone and he told us he was getting better. ""But on Wednesday morning he removed his mask to eat his breakfast, and 10 minutes after eating he faded away."" ""It's a huge shock but I don't blame anybody."" On the 50th anniversary of the disaster Bernard told the BBC: ""I still wonder what the others would have been doing if it hadn't happened. Who would have got married to who, you know."" Bernard is survived by his 90-year-old mother Gwen, with whom he shared a home, and brothers Andrew and Robert.

"More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic, official figures have shown. A further 1,035 deaths in the UK were reported on Saturday, taking the total by that measure to 80,868. The number of daily cases of people who tested positive for coronavirus increased by 59,937. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University.,external It is the fourth day in a row that the UK has reported more than 1,000 daily deaths. It comes as scientists advising the government have warned that lockdown measures in England need to be stricter to achieve the same impact as the March shutdown. Ministers have launched a new campaignurging people to act like they have the virus. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99,received Covid-19 vaccinationson Saturday. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? The Office for National Statistics recently estimated as many as one in 50 people in England had coronavirus between 27 December and 2 January, while in London it was one in 30. On Friday, mayor Sadiq Khan saidthe spread of Covid in the capital was ""out of control"". Official figures from Public Health England showed London had the highest regional case rate in the UK, exceeding 1,000 per 100,000 people. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can only go out for essential reasons. Similar measures are in place across most of Scotland, in Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the current rules were ""still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus"". He said the new variant of Covid was around 50% more infectious compared to the virus that infected people last March. ""That means that if we were to achieve the same result as we got in March we would have to have a stricter lockdown, and it (the current regime) is not stricter,"" he added. The professor of health psychology at University College London also told the BBC more children were going to school, compared to during the first lockdown. He said schools were ""a very important seed of community infection"". More children are at school, after the Department for Education widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils allowed to attend. Attendance rates have risen to 50% in some places. Prof Susan Michie, who is also a member of Sage, said the spread of the new, more infectious variant meant current restrictions were ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said, in comparison to the first lockdown in spring 2020, more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's statutory sick pay system was ""not fit for purpose for a pandemic"" and more effective measures to encourage people to isolate were needed.
