"The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil is seeing ""unprecedented"" demand The number of people in hospital with Covid is the highest since the pandemic began, with a top doctor saying it could get ""significantly worse"". There are 2,231 coronavirus patients in hospitals and Wales' lead respiratory doctor said hospital pressures were ""much worse than the first wave"". It comes as Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said Covid patients were occupying all its intensive care beds. Hywel Dda will delay routine care due to a record number of Covid inpatients. Intensive care units across Wales are treating the highest number of coronavirus patients since April. TheUK's seven most infected local authoritiesare all in Wales - Merthyr Tydfil tops the list with 1,128.9 cases per 100,000 people - while Bridgend, in second, has the highest Covid test positivity rate in the country with 28%. Cwm Taf Morgannwg, the health board that covers Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd and Bridgend, hassuspended some non-emergency servicesand is treating 500 coronavirus patients in an ""unprecedented demand"" on services. Cwm Taf pauses non-urgent services over Covid NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Behind the scenes on the coronavirus front line Now Hywel Dda, the health board that covers parts of west and mid Wales, will temporarily postpone routine appointments from Monday as it is ""treating the highest number of inpatients with confirmed Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic"". Two other south Wales health boards -Aneurin Bevanin the south-east andSwansea Bay- have also suspended non-urgent care. Wales has the highest infection rate of the UK nations - 530.2 cases per 100,000 people over seven days - and Dr Simon Barry, the national respiratory lead doctor in Wales, has warned the pressure on Welsh hospitals will get worse. ""It is fair to say, and this belief is reflected by my colleagues in other parts of Wales, it is exceptionally busy and much worse than it was during the first wave,"" said Dr Barry. ""The hospitals are full - they are full of general medical patients. The difference with the first wave is that both streams are busy so we basically don't have capacity in the hospitals."" Almost 18,000 of Wales' 117,367 Covid cases have been reported by Public Health Wales in the past seven days and patients with the virus make up 28% of all patients in hospital. More than3,000 people have died in Wales with CovidandWales' R numberhas risen to between 0.9 and 1.2 - and Dr Barry believes that is reflected in the number of patients in hospital. While hospitals are filling up, Dr Barry said the impact of staff sickness and isolation was affecting the care that can be delivered, with a shortage of intensive care nurses a ""major issue"". The intensive care unit at Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend is also full of Covid patients ""On intensive care there are a lot of nurses who are sick or are shielding,"" said the consultant chest physician from Cardiff. ""You have to have one-to-two nursing, and they can't achieve that. Similarly, if you are managing patients on respiratory wards where you have got sick people, and it is essentially a high-dependency ward, we don't have enough nurses. ""That is reflected across every hospital in Wales. That is the major issue, it is about staffing."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board has seen a 28% rise in coronavirus patients over the past week and 42% of all its patients in hospital beds have the virus. The numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds in Wales set another record on Thursday - 2,231 across Wales - up 13% on the week before. Earlier, Cwm Taf's medical director Dr Nick Lyons said people's behaviour was going to make a bigger difference, especially around Christmas, than the new Welsh Government rules. ""When I see our hospitals under the pressure they're under, the difficulties that are going to be caused to the population we serve by the decisions made, then I think it's as much making that personal link between what our own actions make as we prepare for Christmas,"" he said. ""That's going to make the real difference and that's going to save lives."" Case rates in the areas which make up the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board also include the two highest in Wales - Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend. Aneurin Bevan health board has the highest number of Covid patients - 43% of its 1,357 patients - while Hywel Dda is using more of its field hospitals to manage ""patient capacity and flow"" in hospitals. ""The measures we are taking are intended to protect patients with the most urgent clinical need whilst allowing us to reprioritise staff to mitigate the increasing risk of harm in acute and emergency care, due to the pressures,"" said Hywel Dda operations director Andrew Carruthers.

"Sweden has not imposed tough restrictions seen elsewhere in Europe Sweden's government is recommending wearing face masks on public transport during the rush hour, reversing its earlier Covid guidance. It will also cut from the current eight to four per table the number of people sitting together in restaurants, and ban alcohol sales after 20:00. PM Stefan LÃ¶fven unveiled the measures, which will take effect soon. Elsewhere in Europe, Italy and Austria are the latest countries to be placed in lockdowns over the Christmas period. Sweden, which has never imposed a full lockdown, has seen nearly 360,000 cases and 8,000 deaths - many more than its Scandinavian neighbours. The country had previously been one of only a few nations not to recommend masks in public outside of healthcare settings. This is despite strong recommendations given by the World Health Organization (WHO). Did Sweden's coronavirus strategy succeed or fail? What is Europe doing about Covid and Christmas? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? On Thursday,Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf said the Scandinavian nation ""failed"" to save liveswith its relatively relaxed approach to the coronavirus outbreak.

The measure was announced in response to rising Covid-19 cases. This came a week after a nationwide decision on 7 December to switch to remote learning for those over 16. And on Monday, new nationwide social-distancing recommendations for the Christmas period came into force, replacing similar region-specific guidelines. Sweden is not alone in tightening coronavirus restrictions. A number of European countries have done so ahead of Christmas following a surge of infections. TheNetherlandsandGermanyhave imposed lockdowns until January. On Friday,Italyfollowed suit, imposing a nationwide lockdown for much of the Christmas and New Year period. Italians will only be allowed to travel for work, health or emergency reasons between 24-27 December, 31 December - 3 January, and 5-6 January. What restrictions are in place in Europe? InAustria, the government said on Friday the country would enter its third lockdown after Christmas. From 26 December, non-essential shops will be shut and movement outside homes restricted. However, a mass testing programme in January will give people the opportunity to end their lockdown sooner. The government said those who test negative for the virus will be allowed more freedoms.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" There are ""just a few hours left"" for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Michel Barnier. Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the two sides to come to an agreement. He said there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, but the ""path is very narrow"". Boris Johnson said the UK side was willing to ""keep talking"", but added: ""Things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged."" Talks are resuming later between the two teams in Brussels after the prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Thursday night. Mrs von der Leyen said bridging ""big differences"", particularly on fishing rights, would be ""very challenging"", while Mr Johnson said a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Earlier, Mr Barnier met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the ongoing division over the issue. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""dithering over Brexit"", calling for the PM to ""get this deal done"" and ""deliver it for the British people"". Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but has been following the bloc's trade rules while the two sides negotiate a trade deal. If one is not agreed by 31 December, they will go on to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Mr Barnier said it was the UK that decided on the deadline and the EU would have been willing to extend the so-called transition period into next year so talks could continue. ""If they should leave with an agreement or without, it is nevertheless the Brits that decided on that deadline,"" he told the European Parliament. Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will ""prosper"" with or without a trade deal with the EU. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The talks taking place in Brussels between Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart, Lord David Frost, are aimed at breaking the deadlock on key issues that remain unresolved. They include rights to fishing waters from 1 January and what is known as the ""level playing field"" - where the EU does not want UK businesses to get an unfair advantage by moving away from its rules and standards. On fishing, Mr Barnier said if the UK wants to use its ""sovereignty"" over its waters to cut access for EU fisherman, ""then the European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or compensate adjusting conditions [to access the] single market"". And on the level playing field, he said there needed to be ""fair competition"" in place, adding: ""If the sovereign United Kingdom would like to depart from those standards, that is their right, but it brings with it consequences when it comes to access to our markets without tariffs or quotas."" Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking on a visit to Manchester, Mr Johnson said the UK position was ""always that we want to keep talking if there is any chance of a deal"". But he called for the EU to ""recognise the UK has got to be able to control its own laws - that's what people voted for - and we have also got to be able to control our waters and fishing rights"". The PM added: ""No sensible government is going to agree to a treaty that doesn't have those two basic things in it as well as everything else. ""Our door is open, we will keep talking, but I have to say that things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged. ""The UK has done a lot to try and help and we hope our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves."" Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and EU. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side, and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"This video can not be played US Vice-President Mike Pence:  ""I didn't feel a thing"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has received the coronavirus vaccine live on TV, telling the audience and doctors: ""I didn't feel a thing."" The White House said the aim of the move was to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people"". Mr Pence's wife and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received the jab at the televised White House event. On Monday the US began rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The first vaccine to be approved in the US, it offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to locations across the 50 US states. President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, will receive the vaccine on Monday, a spokesperson told US media. Also on Friday,a second vaccine, developed by Moderna, received emergency approvalby the Food and Drug Administration after it was endorsed by a panel of experts. As Mr Pence was receiving his jab, Mr Trump incorrectly said on Twitter that the Moderna vaccine had been ""overwhelmingly approved"" with ""distribution to start immediately"". It is still awaiting final approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More than 310,000 people have died with coronavirus in the US, which has recorded more infections and fatalities than any other country.

""We gather here today at the end of a historic week to affirm to the American people that hope is on the way,"" he told the crowd, after the number of newly recorded US coronavirus deaths surpassed 3,000 for the third day in a row. ""Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine that we have secured and produced for the American people,"" he continued, calling it ""a truly inspiring day"". Top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield were in the audience to observe the doctors from Walter Reed hospital perform the injections.

"The UK's R - or reproduction - number is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the coronavirus epidemic is growing once again. Covid-19 cases have risen to an estimated 660,000 infections across the UK between 6-12 December. In England, the rise was driven by sharp increases in London, plus rises in the South East and East Midlands. But the proportion of people testing positive in the North West and Yorkshire has continued to fall. Roughly one in every 95 people had the virus across Britain last week. The previous week's figures suggested about 560,000 people had the virus across the UK - one in 115 people in England, one in 120 in Scotland, one in 175 in Wales and one in 235 in Northern Ireland. So weekly cases have gone up by about a fifth. Covid cases are broadly stable in Northern Ireland with about one in every 215 people testing positive, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. The R number tells you how fast the epidemic is growing or shrinking. Anything above one - indicating that each infection leads to more than one extra infection - means the epidemic is growing. What is the R number and how is it calculated? Prof Neil Ferguson, the influential epidemiologist from Imperial College London, told Radio 4's the World at One any future lockdown may have to be tougher than the one seen in England in November. He said he was ""more concerned about what we're going to be facing in early January than I am over the Christmas period itself. ""We're facing very rapid increases in case numbers over time and we have very little headroom - we've heard reports today that local hospitals that really are at their limits at the moment - as is typically the case in winter. So we just won't be able to allow case numbers to rise much further."" In England, there were increases in people testing positive in all age groups apart from 17-24-year-olds and 50-69-year-olds. The figures suggest infections maybe levelling off in teenagers and young adults. The highest proportions of Covid cases are now found in London and the East Midlands, followed by the North East and North West of England. Across the UK, restrictions are about to be loosened over the Christmas period. Prof Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said this policy, ""increasingly looks like the wrong decision at the wrong time. ""By allowing travel around the UK and changing guidance to allow household mixing indoors we are setting ourselves up for a miserable January with tough restrictions."" Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced new lockdowns to come into force immediately after this period of relaxation. Similar arrangements for England and Scotland have not been announced, but they also haven't been ruled out. What is happening to the UK's R number?

"Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full as hospitals try to cope with the demands of Covid in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. This could result in some trusts facing the decision to stop non-Covid work. Rises in hospital admissions are particularly affecting areas in the south. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending December 13. This is the highest occupancy rate so far this year - it's still lower than the same time last year, although the extra burden of Covid is likely to make hospitals feel they are much busier. A safe level for bed occupancy is below 90% but nearly half of NHS trusts report a figure currently higher than this - the largest proportion this season. The south and east of England are facing the most pressure on beds. Across England, individual hospitals and trusts are coping with varying levels of pressure, and these can change daily. Trusts in and around London make up most of the busiest ranked by beds occupied - all of the top 10 are over 95%, with three running even higher at over 97%. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She said the combination of staff who are tired, unwell or having to isolate, and the additional burden of Covid, was an ""awful situation"" to be in. She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. ""We have to get a grip of the virus and do whatever it takes,"" Dr Henderson added. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said he suspected ""many, many trusts"" had already cancelled routine clinics or procedures to try to free up staff for the challenges of winter. ""What we do know is that the country is in the grip of one crisis and is about to embark on another in the coming weeks, and the fact we will see a festive period with families mixing strikes fear into the hearts of clinicians on the frontline,"" he said. Recent rises in numbers of people admitted to hospital with Covid are putting major pressure on other hospital work. For example,Leicester's hospitals are now on the highest level of alertwhilethree in Essex have stopped non-urgent operationsdue to the number of Covid-19 cases. It also means critical care is getting busier in England, with three-quarters of of adult critical care beds occupied last week - up slightly from the previous week. However, this figure was higher during the week ending 22 November in the midst of the second lockdown, when it hit 76.4%. Three NHS trusts reported their critical-care beds were 100% full - Calderdale and Huddersfield, Portsmouth Hospitals University and Sandwell and West Birmingham, in the week to 13 December. Delays in ambulances transferring patients over to emergency staff when they arrive at hospital are also causing knock-on problems. One in seven ambulances faced delays of 30 minutes doing this, affecting more than 13,000 patients. The target is to transfer patients within 15 minutes. The highest proportion of ambulance delays occurred in University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust (43%), Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust (42%) and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (41%). However, ambulance delays are common during winter and this number is not particularly high for this time of year. By BBC Reality Check Like most front-line sectors, coronavirus has had an impact on staffing due to illness and self-isolation. Back in April, when the virus first peaked, the staff absence rate reached 6.2% - the highest on record. This means that more than one in 20 working days were lost to illness. Roughly a third of these were lost due to coronavirus. We don't have data coinciding with the most recent surge in cases , so we can't assess how well Kent and Medway - which is very much at the epicentre of the outbreak at the moment - is dealing with staffing. But when London was the centre of the crisis, sickness rates hit as high as 7.2%. With winter coming in, the pressures of coronavirus will add to what is already a difficult time of the year for staffing; over the past five years, January's absence rate has averaged at just under 5%. NHS Providers has pointed out that this is combined with already high staff vacancies, which stand at 85,000 in England. This is down from 110,000 in 2018. It is also worth mentioning that - with the exception of April - coronavirus has not been the leading cause of staff absences throughout the year. Burn-out, anxiety and other mental health issues equate to one in three sick days for NHS staff in most months.

"Ian Hopkins had been on sick leave Greater Manchester Police's chief constable has stood down after the force was placed into special measures. The force was put into an""advanced phase"" of monitoringon Thursday after inspectors found it had failed to record 80,000 crimes in a year. Ian Hopkins said he would step down with immediate effect. Home Secretary Priti Patel accused the region's mayor Andy Burnham of throwing the officer ""under the bus to save his own skin"". Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said it was left ""deeply troubled"" over how cases handled by GMP were closed without proper investigation.

She said crimes like stalking and coercive control were ""profoundly traumatising"" and victims needed ""not only the support of police to get orders restraining the perpetrator and to take them to court, but they also need to be safeguarded and referred to appropriate victim's services"". She added that ""none of that was happening"" and vulnerable people had ""simply been deserted"". Regional mayor Andy Burnham oversees policing in Greater Manchester In a statement, Mr Hopkins,who had been on sick leave, said these were ""challenging times"" for GMP and he believed a chief constable should oversee the force's ""long-term strategic plan"" to address the issues raised from ""start to finish"". Mr Hopkins revealed on Wednesday he had been suffering fromlabyrinthitis,external- an inner-ear infection which affects balance - since the end of October. The news of the chief constable standing down had barely broken when reporters phones started buzzing with a message from Home Secretary Priti Patel's party political spokesman. ""It's no surprise that the Labour mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham has thrown a senior police officer under the bus to save his own skin,"" the message said. Last week, the MP wrote a blistering letter to Mr Burnham about GMP's performance, saying she was ""deeply concerned"". Her spokesman then sent the letter to journalists saying ""this is exactly what happens when Labour are in power - people are let down by them"". In reply, Mr Burnham pointed out Conservative government cuts had lost the force 2,000 police officers and 1,000 police staff. He also highlighted Ms Patel's department had failed todeport three members of an infamous Rochdale grooming gang. This political tension between populist heavyweights could possibly bring about better policing for the people of Manchester, but it seems more likely that they will lose out as the parties battle over who is responsible for the miserable performance of the force, instead of working together to improve things. Mr Hopkins said given his ill health, he would bring his retirement, which he was due to take in autumn 2021, forward. He has been chief constable of GMP since October 2015, leading a force of almost 7,000 officers. ""Throughout my career, I have been committed to achieving the best outcomes for the people I serve [and] the decision to stand down is not one I have taken lightly, but I feel the time is right,"" he said. Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green earlier called for Mr Burnham, who oversees policing in the region,to step down over the HMICFRS findings. The Labour mayor said while he had ""a regard"" for Mr Hopkins, ""now is the time for new leadership and a new era in our police force"". ""At the end of the day, it's public confidence in Greater Manchester Police that matters,"" he said. He said Mr Hopkins had led the force during ""one of the most difficult periods in its history"" and had dealt with budget cuts and ""complex threats"", such as the Manchester Arena terror attack, but GMP had not made the progress needed ""in other important areas"". Mr Burnham, who has responsibilities around the force's governance and budgets, said he ""did not run GMP on a day-to-day basis"" and his job was to hold it to account. ""At times, this essential task has been made too difficult by an overly defensive culture within GMP,"" he said. ""This needs to change if GMP is to develop the open learning culture that will allow the failures identified to be properly addressed."" Mr Burnham said deputy chief constable Ian Pilling would assume the operational duties of chief constable ahead of a full recruitment process. Stu Berry, the chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, said the issues that had been reported about the force's failures ""should not - and must not - detract from the efforts of our hard working officers"".

"Two weeks ago, millions of people watched Pastor Mick Fleming and Father Alex Frost on BBC News, feeding and clothing the poor in Burnley. Many were moved by their work, and since then they have received more than Â£250,000 in donations. But Mick's life wasn't always about love and care. He was once a dangerous, violent drug user and dealer, covering up painful childhood memories. Until a single moment changed everything. It was 10am, in a rough industrial area, far away from his home county of Lancashire. Mick Fleming, in his early 40s, was waiting outside a gym for someone to emerge. Mick was in a stolen car - a dark blue Vauxhall Cavalier - with the engine running. This was going to have to be quick. ""There was no sun, it was a dull dark day, I knew his routine, everything about him,"" he says. ""He was another drug dealer, just like me."" Mick was a well-established underworld fixer in the North West of England. He was the man others would ring to clear drug debts, and by the time he got the call it meant someone was heavily in debt to equally dangerous people. They were about to get hurt, and badly. ""My gun was in a plastic carrier bag, on the passenger seat, wrapped tight. You could see the shape of the gun, no DNA or prints would be left behind. Six bullets, spring loaded, it never fails."" He didn't have to wait long. ""I watched him walk out of the gym. But this time was different. He had two kids with him, two young children, blonde girls, around five years old. ""I got out of the car, and walked, my hand reaching into the plastic. But then I looked again at the children, again at their faces, their blonde hair, innocent kids. ""Then it happened."" Mick describes in detail seeing a blinding light coming from one of the children's hands. ""It was white, brilliant white. For 15 seconds I couldn't see,"" he says. ""It was like looking into the sun and I was paralysed by it."" Mick doesn't know what really happened to him that day, but one thing he is certain of - this was the moment that changed his life forever. ""I collapsed, then struggled back to the car. I felt sick, I was shaking, sweating, heart beating fast. I could hear my pulse as if it was in my head. I didn't know what was happening to me."" And then, he says, he pleaded with God to help him. But nothing happened. The only thing piercing the silence, he says, was Johnny Cash randomly playing on the radio. The song was Man in Black. ""I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,"" Cash sang. ""I felt like I was the Man in Black. By this point in my life, I had been arrested for attempted murder, kidnapping, firearms offences. I wanted to die, I'd had enough."" Mick took the gun, pressed it to his chin, still wrapped in plastic, and pulled the trigger. It didn't fire. ""I broke down, the tears would not stop falling, and I started to feel sick again. I was retching and I punched and smashed the car radio, my hand started to bleed. ""In that moment I was seeing myself for who I really was. I hadn't cried for nearly 30 years. The last time I cried like this was when I was 11 years old. Sitting in that car it was like I was crying for him, that child, the boy I was, and the life I could have had."" Mick was suffering a complete breakdown, his violent past catching up with him, the end of decades of pain. When Ed Thomas met Pastor Mick Watch:Poverty and the Pandemic: Burnley's Front Line Producer: Lou Martin Mick was born during England's 1966 World Cup-winning year into a Burnley working-class family. His Dad was a window cleaner, who had contracts to clean factories around the town, and, as Mick describes him, a ""proper Labour-supporting man"". ""It wasn't poverty, but it wasn't luxury. It was a strict upbringing. We were forced to go to Church, we couldn't step out of line, it was old-school discipline."" But everything changed over two days at the beginning of February 1977. On the first day of the month, Mick was attacked by a stranger in the park on the way to school. He was just 11 years old. ""I was in turmoil,"" he says. ""I'd been sexually abused, and I couldn't cope."" Mick realised he needed help, but first he had to tell his Mum and Dad. He walked out of his room where he had been crying, went downstairs, and looked his Mum straight in the eye. But what happened next was both cruel and extraordinary. ""Before I could open my mouth, the front door opened. It was my dad. He shouted, 'Your sister is dead.' It was brutal, just so direct. I remember the moment of pure silence, quickly pierced by the screams from my mother, howling like an animal."" Mick had been very close to his 20-year-old sister Ann. He says she looked out for him, gave him money, and bought him clothes. Ann, he later discovered, had had a heart attack and died in her father's arms at the doors to Burnley hospital. ""My dad was a tough man, but this must have been horrific for him. He watched the doctors and nurses trying desperately to resuscitate my sister."" Mick told me that this was the moment his childhood ended. A life disfigured in 48 hours. ""Drugs were my solution, and that was my introduction. The next 30 years were hell. Pure hell. I would use any drug, and always alcohol."" But with his dependency came criminality. At just 14 he was dealing drugs. People in Burnley, though, just thought he was self-employed, working out of town. The truth was very different. ""I was a drug runner and debt collector. I was good at my job. I'd hurt people. I wasn't bothered. I was arrested for murder twice, armed robbery three times, countless firearms offences. ""I was making crazy money, but there was nothing glamorous about this. I was lost, trying to keep my pain down, hide it. None of it worked."" In the 90s, there were two serious attempts on Mick's life, one a drive-by at traffic lights, the other a home invasion that went wrong. ""Criminality was my world. I didn't know how to work in a factory - I couldn't be normal. I'd see people going to work with sandwich boxes and I didn't want that. I wanted to stand out. ""Drugs were a constant around me - my best friend died from a drinking session aged 16. He choked on his own vomit, my other friend suffered a methadone overdose at 17. ""I became hardened to death. I always believed in God, but I also believed God didn't think too much of me."" Mick was also leading a double life - he had a wife and three children. But the years of lies took their toll. Mick's mum had to step in to take care of the children, to prevent social services getting involved. He says that during this ""horrendous"" time his home was often raided by police looking for drugs and guns. ""All this destroyed my mental health, too. I started taking more drugs. I was now a very dangerous man collecting debts, hurting people. I never expected to live long - genuinely I always believed I'd die young. I didn't want to live, I didn't know how to change."" It was 2009 when Mick found himself outside that gym with a gun wrapped in plastic. What happened in the car, the call to God for help, the attempt to take his own life, triggered an intervention by the authorities. ""Within 24 hours, I was sectioned under The Mental Health Act. My new home was Burnley psychiatric unit. I had nothing but the clothes I arrived in."" Strangely, Mick says, he felt at home in the unit. The patients made him feel loved and cared for. They gave him things - cigarettes, clothes, trainers. ""There were schizophrenic people in there who weren't treated, those who self-harmed, really ill people, the most vulnerable alcoholics. But these people were giving me essentials, because they saw I had nothing. I was overwhelmed."" It was here that Mick met Pastor Tony, who used to visit the unit. Together they prayed and talked, and Mick says he began to feel emotions again. He started helping others. It was the end of a troubled life, and the beginning of a new one of hope. A chance meeting with a tutor at the University of Manchester led to a degree in theology. It was tough at first - without much of an education Mick struggled to read and write, and was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia. He failed his first year, but with hard work and support from the university, he eventually achieved a 2:1 degree. ""I never drank or touched a drug again. It wasn't easy, it was horrendous. But it was my path to God - and all the way to 2020 and the pandemic. I had no idea of how much I'd be needed and how once again I'd be overwhelmed by suffering and pain."" Today you'll find the man now known as Pastor Mick, with the charity Church on the Street Ministries, in Burnley, with those most in need - the homeless, the drug users, the hungry. During the coronavirus pandemic he's never been needed more. I met him on a crisp, late November evening in an almost-empty car park in the centre of town. It was only 6pm but it was quiet - a silence we've become used to during lockdowns. Pastor Mick began to talk about the struggles he's witnessed this year. ""Politicians say that it's a leveller, this coronavirus. It's a lie, because if you're poor you've got no chance,"" he tells me. Across a dual carriageway, in the distance, they started to arrive. First the homeless, some carrying their belongings in bin bags. Then the users, from those on heroin to those dependent on alcohol. There were around 20 people here, from their 20s and upwards. Then more people came - some in cars, most on foot. At least 40 people were here now, of all ages. Many were desperate, huddling around two cars belonging to the volunteers, looking for warmth and food. ""There's no need to push - there's plenty,"" shouted Kaz, a friend of Pastor Mick's, and a volunteer. The boots of two cars opened and the waft of the hot food hits you first. It was hard not to notice the hands grabbing what they could, a slight push and a shove. Some were so in need, their freezing fingers burned as they touched the food, but it didn't stop them and not a single tray was dropped. It didn't take long for the hot food to be snapped up. There was more though - pre-prepared food bags for people to take home. At the back of the queue there was a gentle complaint. ""There's no chocolate in mine."" ""I think they've all got chocolate in brother,"" said Mick. ""Well mine hasn't."" ""I'm not Asda,"" Pastor Mick retorted with a smile. Most here were respectful and thankful, but there was also a sense of community. It's hard to believe this is happening in the UK today. Burnley is one of the most deprived local authority districts in England. What's more, the local council's spending power was reduced at a greater rate than the English average between 2010/11 and 2018/19. There's a young couple here who are struggling - she is in a wheelchair, he is her carer. They say they're having difficulties getting food and money to get by. ""A couple of day's food makes a massive difference to us,"" they tell me. Another car boot opened, this time it was full of clothes. It was now a more frantic scene as people searched through it. One woman in her 30s told me that she suffered from depression and the pandemic had made it worse. ""If it hadn't been for all these, I'd basically be dead."" Pastor Mick was approached by a man in tears. ""My foot is white, Pastor Mick, I'm in so much pain,"" he said. ""Don't worry brother, we'll get you sorted."" Mick guided the man in his 20s to two volunteer nurses, positioned away from the group for privacy. After 25 minutes, the initial rush had calmed. ""The need is absolutely colossal,"" said Mick. ""You've seen people who are working who can't make ends meet tonight. We've got volunteer NHS nurses for those who can't access primary care - some of these guys are sleeping on the concrete."" It was the day after the car park session, and Pastor Mick was in his white van, driving through the hilly mill town's stunning scenery, from the sandstone terraces to the prefab bungalows in the villages on the edge of Burnley. The van was packed with food, bread, biscuits, milk, chocolate. His phone never stopped. A 10-year old boy was asking for a freezer on behalf of his mum. Mick was on it. A single parent needed a bed for her child. Mick would sort it. He visited around 10 homes - and he does this every day, seven days a week. ""I go into houses and I sometimes have children ripping the bags open as I am carrying them through the door."" Pastor Mick's voice started to falter, the emotion was too much. ""And it's not alright that, and it wasn't as bad as that before the virus."" Not far from the centre of Burnley, Mick visited the imposing Gothic-style St Matthew's Anglican Church to see Father Alex Frost. They've worked together since the pandemic hit. The room next to the altar is now a makeshift food bank. ""The level of need here in Burnley at the moment, I think, is unprecedented,"" said Fr Alex. ""I think the people feel forgotten about. It is about money and numbers, and statistics. We can't rely on a food bank, it doesn't seem right, it doesn't seem modern day Britain. But it is."" Once Mick stocked up his van, he was back on the road. First up was Pete, his wife, and son. Debt has crippled them. An issue with the family's benefits meant payday loans and financial crisis. ""I had to take loans out, so we could eat and pay us bills,"" said Pete. ""We were in debt for well over a thousand pound. Thanks to Pastor Mick, we've got it down now to two, three hundred pounds. My son suffers from depression from it, and so does my wife."" Mick was off again. This time to see Viv. She's 55, lives alone and suffered terribly with her mental health during lockdown. ""I stopped eating for about a week, I just ended up collapsing on my bathroom floor and I were there for, I think, a full day,"" she tells me. ""Hyperthermia had kicked in with everything with me."" Viv had only recently got out of hospital, and was painfully thin. Mick had got some high-energy nutrition drinks to drop off. Living alone during this time has brought back painful memories for Viv - of previous family bereavements. ""It's like losing all my family again, it's just like brought it all back."" As Mick left, he promised to collect her painkillers prescription later in the day. ""She was trapped inside her house, imagine being trapped inside your own mind. She stopped living,"" he said. Next was a food parcel for Sheila, in her late 50s. Sheila had been diagnosed with stage-four cancer and was worried about the impact coronavirus had had on her care. ""I'm supposed to have blood tests done once a month for my cancer count,"" she said. ""But nobody's been and done it [in] six months. And I've just found out that what I thought was two hernias is not, it's one huge hernia. I can't be operated on, because my lungs won't survive it."" Sheila relies on her 21-year-old granddaughter. ""I don't want to be a drain on the system that's already dying, because I'm already dying, people need the NHS,"" she said. This was just a small insight into one day on Pastor Mick's journey in one town. Across England the death rate from all causes, between April and June this year in the most deprived areas of the country, was nearly double that of the least deprived areas. ""I've never seen anything like this, on this scale,'' said Pastor Mick, ""Poverty seems to be hidden, It's underneath the surface that people don't see, they think they do but they don't. Pastor Mick has travelled his own road to Damascus, from a life of crime to being tested everyday by the impact of coronavirus. I wanted to know what motivates him to keep going. ""What I do today, it's not a penance, it's the complete opposite. It's a privilege to serve the people of Burnley. It's a glorious thing,"" he said. But then Mick revealed a staggering story to try and explain why he is at peace with those terrible events of his childhood. Ten years ago, he befriended a homeless alcoholic outside a take away. Mick listened to him, cared for him, helped him to get sober and reunite with his family. The man died two years later but his family was thankful they'd all been together. ""What I never told him or his family, or the police, was that he was the man who raped me as a child. Why? I knew that I had been forgiven for my past. I didn't do what he had done, but still, terrible things, but I felt forgiven and I didn't want to live in his sin."" ""This is why I'm free, I'm not spending my life in torment. It's redemption."" We next found Pastor Mick praying with a woman outside St Matthew's. It was the second week in a row she had been here. She was distressed but finding comfort in Mick's words. Fr Alex explained what had happened. ""She came last Saturday and she broke down and told me her daughter had killed herself."" Afterwards, the woman, Sonia, explained the difference Pastor Mick and Fr Alex have made to her life. She said that without them she, too, would have taken her life. Inside St Matthew's, Fr Alex, broke down and sobbed. ""I'm sorry about getting upset. You carry people's burdens, you try to tell them it's alright. It's so upsetting."" Pastor Mick is proud that it is ""the people of faith who are stepping in and making a massive difference"". But Fr Alex wants others to find a longer-term answer to the issues exposed by the coronavirus in places like Burnley. The government says it is committed to reducing deprivation and has spent Â£100bn on welfare support this year. This is the story of Pastor Mick's journey, helping just some of those struggling in Burnley. But the fear is the challenges now facing our poorest communities will remain, long after this pandemic is over. Photographs: Phill Edwards Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alex Rodda was killed in woodland in Cheshire A teenager who beat a schoolboy to death with a spanner has told a court he did not think his friends would accept him if he was gay. Matthew Mason, 19, admits killing 15-year-old Alex Rodda in woodland in Ashley, Cheshire, on 12 December last year but denies his murder. Chester Crown Court has heard Mr Mason paid Alex Â£2,000to stop him revealing their sexual relationship. He said he asked his friends for money but did not tell them what it was for. Mr Mason told the court he was ""embarrassed and worried"" and feared the friendship would end ""because they would not accept me for what happened"". Asked by prosecutor Ian Unsworth QC what he meant, he said: ""Because of what me and Alex had done together, like if I was to speak to someone about it they wouldn't understand why it had happened and they wouldn't accept me if I was gay or bisexual."" Mr Mason, of Ash Lane in Ollerton, admitted having sex with Alex but said he thought it was wrong, adding: ""For one, because he was a male and, secondly, his age."" He told the jury he did not hate Alex for blackmailing him but he thought he was ""being a bit of a bully"". The court heard Mr Mason had searched the internet for phrases including ""what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs"" and ""everyday poison"". He told jurors he felt depressed and suicidal after his girlfriend broke up with him when Alex contacted her and told her about an explicit photo and video he had sent him. Mr Mason told the court he worked at a plant hire firm, attended Reaseheath College and was rehearsing for the Young Farmers' Club's Christmas play. He accepted he hit Alex at least 15 times on the head with the spanner after driving to remote woodland. He said when he drove away from the scene he threw Alex's phone out of the car. The jury was told before giving evidence he had not previously admitted disposing of the phone. The trial continues.

"Sony has pulled Cyberpunk 2077, one of the year's most-anticipated games, from its store and offered refunds to all players. The unprecedented move follows complaints that the game has been riddled with bugs and glitches, and is prone to crashes. Microsoft later said it would also refund any dissatisfied Xbox players. Developer CD Projekt Red has promised to issue patches to improve the game for those who do not return it. Itâs unclear when Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) plans to return the game to the PlayStation Store. Cyberpunk 2077 makers apologise for game glitches Cyberpunk adds epilepsy warning amid seizure fears Cyberpunk 2077 a 'warning' about the future âSIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, therefore we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store,â the company said. A Microsoft spokesperson said Xbox players would also get refunds - but is not pulling the game from sale. ""We know the developers at CD Projekt Red have worked hard to ship Cyberpunk in extremely challenging circumstances,"" a spokesperson said. ""However, we also realise that some players have been unhappy with the current experience on older consoles."" To rectify the situation it said it was issuing refunds to customers who have already requested one and would be expanding refunds to ""anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, until further notice"". To request an Xbox refund, users needed to follow the steps listed on theXbox refund page,external. Some Sony users reported being unable to request the refund, even after the announcement - something Sony said it was working ""to get up and running as soon as possible"". It can still be bought on PCs - and gamers who do not want be reimbursed for their copies can still play the game and receive updates. Older consoles In Cyberpunk 2077, players live in a criminal world where they can pay to upgrade their bodies with technology. The action role-playing game was originally ""announced"" in 2012, but then re-announced in 2018 and then showcased with huge fanfare - and an appearance by Keanu Reeves - in June 2019. This video can not be played Keanu Reeves talks to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue The game reviewed well, with critics praising its gameplay and visuals - despite many visual glitches and bugs, which are common in large open-world games and often patched after launch day. But on release it became clear that versions of the game for older consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One ran poorly, with hitching, visual quality drops and slowdown that many players said made the game unplayable. Those with the newest versions of consoles, or a high-end gaming PC, have not experienced the same level of issues. CD Projekt Red, which traditionally has focused on the PC market, had already acknowledged it ""should have paid more attention to making it play better"" on those consoles. Allow Twitter content?

The company says it will release patches to solve the problems in January and February. âThey wonât make the game on last-gen look like itâs running on a high-spec PC or next-gen console, but it will be closer to that experience than it is now,â the company said in a statement on its website. It also encouraged users to use refund systems on the Sony and Xbox stores if they were unhappy. However,PlayStation's policy is to usually not offer refunds,externalif the game has been downloaded and played, ""unless the content is faulty"". That led to much confusion among players seeking refunds as directed by CD Projekt Red, who were refused such refunds by Sony. It is not clear if the removal of the game from the PlayStation store means that Sony has decided the game is ""faulty"" under its rules. Hours after PlayStation's announcement that it was pulling Cyberpunk 2077 from sale, CD Projekt Red said the game was ""temporarily"" suspended ""following our discussion with PlayStation"". It said the game would ""return as soon as possible"" - but gave no date. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Xbox users also reported trouble with refunds, with many saying refund requests have been refused, despitean apparently flexible refund policy,external. Microsoft says that while it considers all sales final, ""we understand there may be extenuating circumstances"" and it considers several factors for refund requests. But the firm announced it was expanding its refund to cover all digital sales of Cyberpunk 2077 about half a day after Sony.

"The Duchess of Sussex has settled a legal claim against a news agency that photographed her and her son, Archie, the High Court has heard. Splash News and Picture Agency - which is in administration - has agreed not to take photos of her, Prince Harry or Archie, should it resume trading. Meghan's solicitor said the photos were taken during a ""private family outing"" in a park in Canada. Splash administrators accepted the solicitor's comments. The pictures were taken in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on 20 January, using a long lens, and showed Meghan walking with her two dogs, with Archie in a baby sling. The duke and duchess had set up base in Canada at the time, after announcingtheir intention to step back as senior members of the Royal Familyand divide their time between the UK and North America. They later relocated toMeghan's home state of California. Harry and Meghan sue over 'drone photos' of son Prince Harry paid damages over photos of home Harry and Meghan issue media warning over photos Meghan brought privacy and data protection claims against Splash in March both in her own right and with her husband, Harry, on behalf of Archie. However, Splash UK went into administration on 1 July, after the claim had been issued and served. Mr Justice Nicklin heard details of the settlement at a remote High Court hearing. Meghan's solicitor, Jenny Afia, said that in light of the administration the parties had agreed to settle the claim against the agency, with Splash UK agreeing not to take any photographs of the couple or their son, should it come out of administration in the future. Ms Afia told the court the couple's case was that the taking of the photographs was an ""unlawful invasion of privacy"" and their subsequent syndication to the media violated their data protection rights. She said the couple held that when the photographs were taken, Meghan and Archie were on ""a private family outing in a remote rural setting and that there was no public interest in the photographs"". Ms Afia added it was the couple's case that, a day before the photographs were taken, a Splash photographer made ""a full reconnaissance inspection"" of their private home, ""walking around it looking to identify entry and exit points and putting his camera over the fence to take photographs"". Neil Allen, of the administrators of Splash UK, accepted ""all that Ms Afia has said"" on behalf of the agency. A spokesman for the parent company Splash said: ""Splash confirms that one of its former companies has agreed that, should it begin trading again, it will not take unauthorised photographs of the family of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."" A spokesman for Schillings, Meghan and Harry's legal representatives, said the settlement was ""a clear signal that unlawful, invasive and intrusive paparazzi behaviour will not be tolerated, and that the couple takes these matters seriously - just as any family would."" A simultaneous and similar claim against Splash US - Splash UK's American sister company - is continuing through the UK courts, the spokesman added. The duchess is also suing Associated Newspapers, publisher of The Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over publication of a letter the duchess wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. In October,she was granted a postponement of the trial,which had been due to be held in January, until autumn 2021.

"Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges from January School staff feel ""broken"" by last minute demands for them to run testing schemes in secondary schools in England, a head teacher has said. Nicola Mason, a Staffordshire school head, said she was staggered to hear, as the term ends, that heads have to set up testing for pupils next term. It meant staff would be working through Christmas to get ready for January. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the idea was to get pupils back safely when they returned to school. A joint statement from teachers' unions and the National Governance Association, representing school governors, says schools should not feel under pressure to carry out the testing, if it is not a realistic possibility in the time available. The advice, also signed by the Association of Colleges and the Church of England education service, says the announcement of the programme has been ""chaotic and rushed"". It also says the plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges, and stresses that the Department for Education guidance refers to an ""offer"" of testing rather than a requirement for schools to test. Staggered return for England's secondary schools 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests General secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said the scheme was ""undeliverable"" in the timescale set out. ""It is beyond belief that they were landed on school and college leaders in such a cack-handed manner,"" he said. ""It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests, and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period."" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government was ""in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory once again"". The plan involves using the first week of term to test pupils as they return gradually to classrooms in a staggered way. Those in exam years, Years 11 and 13, would return first for face-to-face teaching, while the rest would be taught online. Ms Mason, head teacher at Chase Terrace Academy in Burntwood, said: ""The government at the very last minute again have literally broken the teachers."" This video can not be played Head teacher Simon Uttley: ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality I'm afraid feels a bit more like Dad's Army."" She said local public health teams already had plans in place to phase tests in next term which were now not valid. ""Leaders are confused at best,"" she said. ""The guidance is way too late to plan effectively, there are still a number of things we don't know. ""We found out through BBC News, we weren't even told directly that this was being put into place. Frankly I am staggered."" Another head teacher, Simon Uttley, of Blessed Hugh Faringdon School in Reading, said he also first heard of government plans from the BBC News app. ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality, I'm afraid, feels a bit more like Dad's Army,"" he said. But the prime minister told reporters that in terms of ""social justice"" it was important to make sure as many children as possible were in school. ""Everybody in the country agrees this is a massive priority. If you listen to the Chief Medical Officer, for the health and well-being of young people, they have to receive their education,"" said Mr Johnson. Head teacher Ms Mason said already exhausted staff now had to use the Christmas holidays to plan for remote lessons, recruit volunteers, do safe-guarding checks, and organise the logistics of the testing and gain consent from parents. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Parent of two Ian Ahern from Sandymoor, Cheshire, said: ""What ridiculous timing! ""My two children are in Year 11 and 8. They have just finished for Christmas. ""My wife is a teacher and finishes school today. How are parents, teachers and staff supposed to organise this?"" He added that as a school governor, he knew how hard schools have been working to organise for the next term. Another parent, from Altrincham, Mark Simpson, said: ""It's ridiculously last minute to announce something like this on what for many schools in England is the last day of term, it seems nonsensical."" The late notice for the plan to test ""millions of pupils"" meant it was not going to work, he said. Mr Gibb defended the plans, saying fuller guidance would be published next week filling in any gaps. He said: ""This is a fast-moving pandemic, we have to take action at pace. ""We do have to take swift action, we've been testing these tests in schools over the last several weeks."" This video can not be played Schools minister Nick Gibb sets out Covid-19  testing plans for secondary schools He said the programme would be a national effort supported by the Ministry of Defence and that schools would have the costs of agency staff covered - but it was not clear whether these staff would be health professionals or supply teachers. ""It is very important that we are testing 5.5 million students twice, three days apart, to make sure we are breaking the transmission of the virus after the increased mixing over the Christmas holidays,"" he said. ""It's all about making sure we have more young people in the classroom over the spring and summer term as we go forward, and this is an amazing initiative to get these tests into schools."" The Department for Education guidance says schools would have to provide one to two members of staff and several volunteers (for example governors) to organise and run the testing. Agency staff may be used and schools would be reimbursed, but it is not clear if this means teaching staff or health care professionals. And armed forces personnel are to support the scheme directly by planning with schools and colleges.

"A US judge in Michigan has ruled that a 42-year-old man can seek compensation from his parents for destroying his pornography collection. David Werking, who was living with his parents following a divorce, sued them over the items, which he claims were worth over $25,000 (Â£18,500). His parents argued that they told Mr Werking to not bring the items home. The judge said that, even as landlords, Mr Werking's parents had no right to dispose of items owned by their son. Mr Werking had lived with his parents in Grand Haven, Michigan, for 10 months after his divorce, but moved out in August 2017.  He now lives in Indiana. He said he had left his extensive and ""irreplaceable"" collection of magazines and films at his parents' house when initially moving out, and later discovered they were missing,the Holland Sentinel newspaper,externalreported. The parents said they were not willing to help move the items to Indiana and did not want them in their home. Mr Werking filed the lawsuit arguing the items were illegally destroyed in April 2019. Emails between Mr Werking and his father stated that the items included 12 full boxes of ""pornography plus two boxes of sex toys"", according to the Sentinel. Mr Werking said there were over 1,600 DVDs and tapes. In one, Mr Werking's father told him he did him a ""big favour by getting rid of all this stuff"". Following the verdict, an attorney for the parents said she was working to determine the damages, and had hired an expert from the Erotic Heritage Museum in Nevada to help with the process.

"Business and consumers across the UK are still facing worries that Christmas deliveries won't arrive on time. ""Some things haven't been delivered yet, and it's causing stress to people waiting,"" said Ellie Chalkley, who has an Etsy shop in Glasgow. With just a week till the festive celebration, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. ""All delivery companies are experiencing exceptionally high volumes this year,"" said the Royal Mail. It added that the majority of the Royal Mail network is now running as usual in line with the seasonal peak in demand. Problems have grown because of a huge increase in online Christmas shopping, partly driven by the recent lockdown, and the ongoing Covid restrictions. Price of first class stamps to rise 9p to 85p Ending Saturday post could save Royal Mail Â£225m Royal Mail parcels overtake letters for first time According to the online retail trade body the IMRG, sales for the first two weeks of December jumped by just over 50% compared to the previous year. ""We could not possibly have anticipated this level of packets and parcels, it seems to be intensifying every day,"" said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union. ""That coupled with the arrangements that are going to be in place to keep key workers safe because of COVID and the rising spread of COVID, is complicating what is already a strategical nightmare."" ""Anything that is sent to me via Royal Mail is arriving at least a week late,"" writer Geordie Clarke who lives in north London told the BBC. ""For the past six weeks I've had one postal delivery every week to 10 days for letters and cards, and parcels arrive whenever. ""For example, it took nine days for a 48-hour tracked parcel to arrive."" But financial adviser Andy Rainer, who lives in the Scottish Highlands, reported the opposite experience. ""We haven't experienced any problems, although we may be the lucky ones,"" he told the BBC. ""Parcels sent on Wednesday arrived yesterday. Christmas cards have been sent and received the following day."" The Royal Mail took on around 33,000 seasonal workers to help it cope with the increased demand as well as opening two extra temporary sorting centres. Even so, some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots fell behind, resulting in delays for customers. ""From the start, we have always said that despite our best endeavours, it is possible that some areas of the country may experience a reduction in service levels due to COVID-related absences and necessary social distancing measures at local mail centres and delivery offices,"" it said. Friday 18 December is the last recommended posting date for second class letters and packages, although there's no guarantee they will reach their destination on time. Monday 21 December is the last recommended posting date for first class deliveries although, again, there's no guarantee of timely delivery.

"This video can not be played ""You don't have to cancel Christmas, just postpone it"", says Chris Lea, who's in hospital with Covid-19 A father who is in hospital with coronavirus has urged people not to visit relatives over Christmas. Chris Lea, from Harpenden, Hertfordshire, was taken to hospital on Wednesday as he ""fought for every breath"". From his hospital bed, the 60-year-old said the thought of people travelling around the country visiting family was ""worrying the hell out of me"". ""It is not worth losing an aunt, an uncle or grandparent,"" he said. Mr Lea is on oxygen and being treated with multiple drugs at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital. Beds, Herts and Bucks move to tier 3 Home working call after pregnant nurse Covid death Can I see both my sons at Christmas? And other questions The father-of-four said he had experienced tiredness for a few days but on Wednesday his situation ""escalated from getting short of breath to fighting for every breath in just a few hours"". ""The look on my 16-year-old son's face when I was fighting for breath was heartbreaking,"" he said. Mr Lea was admitted to hospital on Wednesday Mr Lea's said his son's year group was sent home from school and told to isolate recently due to two positive cases and he fears this may be how he caught the virus. ""Sending children to mix with other family members at Christmas is unwise,"" he said. ""If you saw the look on my son's face when I was fighting for my breath you would not want to be sending these children all over the country to see their family. ""You don't have to cancel Christmas, just postpone it, we are so close now with this vaccine - have the big family get-together at Easter or in the summer."" Mr Lea said the care he was receiving was ""phenomenal"" and he had made rapid progress in 48 hours. ""The doctors, nurses, the porters, everyone is working relentlessly hard, they're working like crazy,"" he said. ""They're amazing really. They deserve a medal.""

"Patients in hospital with coronavirus should be offered a follow-up six weeks later to check for ""long Covid"" symptoms, doctors are being advised. The guidance, drawn up by health officials across the UK, says the long-term effects can be ""significant"". They identified 28 of the most common symptoms, from breathlessness and dizziness to chest pain. Mental health problems including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly, have also been reported. ""Because this is a new condition, there is still much that we don't know about it,"" said Paul Chrisp of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which produces health guidance. The NHS has opened 69 specialist clinics across England to offer rehabilitation to people recovering from the disease. There is no single medical definition for long Covid. Two people recovering from an infection can have very different experiences. New guidelines written by the National Institute for Care Excellence (NICE), its counterpart the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the Royal College of GPs, list more than two dozen common long-term symptoms including breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing problems, headaches, loss of smell and dizziness and mental health problems. Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' It can destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,"" said one sufferer, Jade Gray-Christie. Pinning down exactly how many people are affected by the condition has proved difficult. Figures published by the ONSsuggest one in 10 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in a household survey still had symptoms 12 weeks later - but this is still experimental data. Published to help doctors diagnose and treat long Covid, the new guidance says the symptoms are often unpredictable, affecting patients in different ways at different times. It says the likelihood of developing longer-term complications is not thought to be linked to either the severity of the original infection or whether the patient has been admitted to hospital. It recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later to check for new or ongoing symptoms. Those with severe breathlessness or other respiratory problems should be offered a chest X-ray. Those who do not need hospital treatment but are still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. ""This [guidance] could help to relieve anxiety when people do not recover in the way they expect, particularly because symptoms can fluctuate and there are so many different symptoms reported,"" said Dr Chrisp, director of the Centre for Guidelines at NICE. NHS England said it is spending Â£10m to help fund a network of 69 long Covid clinics staffed by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, with another 12 sites planned for January. Patients cannot attend directly but must be referred by their doctor or GP. In Scotland and Wales, the idea is to adapt existing services and provide more community rehabilitation. One doctor welcomed the ""modest"" increase in NHS funding but said more needed to be done to avoid an ""epidemic of post-Covid disability"". ""All too often the NHS focuses on saving lives but neglects the needs of the survivors,"" said Michael Sharpe, professor of psychological medicine at the University of Oxford. ""We must not make that mistake this time. We need to mobilise again to reduce the risk of long-term disability in those who survived Covid-19.""

"The boys were were freed on Thursday in Tsafe town in Zamfara state More than 300 schoolboys have been reunited with their families, a week after they were kidnapped from their school in north-west Nigeria. The boys arrived by bus in Katsina, capital of the state of the same name, where they were met by President Muhammadu Buhari. Looking weary, some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets. State authorities now say the children were abducted by local bandits. Jihadist militant group Boko Haram had claimed to have been behind the mass kidnapping but some experts were sceptical because it occurred well outside their normal area of operations. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Who carried out the kidnapping? The town that lost its girls According to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, 344 boys were freed but others remain missing. They were abducted on 11 December in an attack on a school in the town of Kankara. Flanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor. They were also due to undergo medical checks. Parents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. ""I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,"" one mother told Reuters news agency. ""I'm so excited,"" said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15. ""I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,"" she told AFP news agency. One boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was ""really happy"" to be back in Katsina. Addressing the freed children, Governor Masari said: ""You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more."" Earlier he had told media: ""I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them."" The government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers. Zamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured. They were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say. Mr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances. ""Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,"" the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers. The boys were ferried into Katsina on buses Conflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos. Both groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west. A spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits. ""It wasn't Boko Haram,"" he said. ""The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders."" Witnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots. This video can not be played Abdulhadi Abubaka describes how he managed to avoid the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school Some were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men. On Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young. One of the boys said they had been taken captive by ""the gang of Abu Shekau"". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized. The name of the group, which is based in north-east Nigeria, loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden"". Armed attacks and kidnappings are rife in the north-west and are often blamed on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area. Amnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice.

Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity.

Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541.

It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November.

Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

casesâ and âmakeshift hospitalsâ. Terms also included âcontactless deliveryâ, as a result of people
increasingly shopping online, and âhealth QR codeâ â a digital code

public transport. Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor Mass testing in Englandâs schools at the start of next term is âundeliverableâ due the chaotic and rushed nature of the announcement, according to a coalition of education unions, school governors, both college organisations and the Church of England Education service. In a joint statement they say âunanswered questionsâ remain, including about what staff are expected to do and what costs will be covered. Advice is being issued to all the head teachers, teachers, schools and colleges by the coalition to say if a decision is taken that they are unable to set up a testing system, based on the current plans, they will have support.

"The boys were were freed on Thursday in Tsafe town in Zamfara state More than 300 schoolboys have been reunited with their families, a week after they were kidnapped from their school in north-west Nigeria. The boys arrived by bus in Katsina, capital of the state of the same name, where they were met by President Muhammadu Buhari. Looking weary, some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets. State authorities now say the children were abducted by local bandits. Jihadist militant group Boko Haram had claimed to have been behind the mass kidnapping but some experts were sceptical because it occurred well outside their normal area of operations. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Who carried out the kidnapping? The town that lost its girls According to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, 344 boys were freed but others remain missing. They were abducted on 11 December in an attack on a school in the town of Kankara. Flanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor. They were also due to undergo medical checks. Parents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. ""I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,"" one mother told Reuters news agency. ""I'm so excited,"" said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15. ""I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,"" she told AFP news agency. One boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was ""really happy"" to be back in Katsina. Addressing the freed children, Governor Masari said: ""You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more."" Earlier he had told media: ""I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them."" The government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers. Zamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured. They were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say. Mr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances. ""Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,"" the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers. The boys were ferried into Katsina on buses Conflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos. Both groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west. A spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits. ""It wasn't Boko Haram,"" he said. ""The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders."" Witnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots. This video can not be played Abdulhadi Abubaka describes how he managed to avoid the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school Some were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men. On Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young. One of the boys said they had been taken captive by ""the gang of Abu Shekau"". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized. The name of the group, which is based in north-east Nigeria, loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden"". Armed attacks and kidnappings are rife in the north-west and are often blamed on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area. Amnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice.

"Boris Johnson says he hopes to avoid a third lockdown in England but warns infection rates have risen ""very much"" in recent weeks Northern Ireland has announced a new six-week coronavirus lockdown from 26 December Wales has already announced a three-week lockdown from 28 December and Scotland is considering tighter restrictions Ministers have defended plans for many pupils in England and Wales to have a staggered return post-Christmas Teachers say the announcement - designed to allow schools to set up Covid testing schemes - came too late A second vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts The head of the FDA said it would move ""rapidly"" to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing millions of doses to be shipped Globally there have been 75 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1.66 million deaths with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University If you are just joining us here are some of the headlines from across the UK today. That's all from our live coronavirus coverage for today. It has been edited by Chris Clayton and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and written by Francesca Gillett, David Walker, Paul Kirby and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" There are ""just a few hours left"" for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Michel Barnier. Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the two sides to come to an agreement. He said there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, but the ""path is very narrow"". Boris Johnson said the UK side was willing to ""keep talking"", but added: ""Things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged."" Talks are resuming later between the two teams in Brussels after the prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Thursday night. Mrs von der Leyen said bridging ""big differences"", particularly on fishing rights, would be ""very challenging"", while Mr Johnson said a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Earlier, Mr Barnier met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the ongoing division over the issue. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""dithering over Brexit"", calling for the PM to ""get this deal done"" and ""deliver it for the British people"". Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but has been following the bloc's trade rules while the two sides negotiate a trade deal. If one is not agreed by 31 December, they will go on to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Mr Barnier said it was the UK that decided on the deadline and the EU would have been willing to extend the so-called transition period into next year so talks could continue. ""If they should leave with an agreement or without, it is nevertheless the Brits that decided on that deadline,"" he told the European Parliament. Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will ""prosper"" with or without a trade deal with the EU. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The talks taking place in Brussels between Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart, Lord David Frost, are aimed at breaking the deadlock on key issues that remain unresolved. They include rights to fishing waters from 1 January and what is known as the ""level playing field"" - where the EU does not want UK businesses to get an unfair advantage by moving away from its rules and standards. On fishing, Mr Barnier said if the UK wants to use its ""sovereignty"" over its waters to cut access for EU fisherman, ""then the European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or compensate adjusting conditions [to access the] single market"". And on the level playing field, he said there needed to be ""fair competition"" in place, adding: ""If the sovereign United Kingdom would like to depart from those standards, that is their right, but it brings with it consequences when it comes to access to our markets without tariffs or quotas."" Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking on a visit to Manchester, Mr Johnson said the UK position was ""always that we want to keep talking if there is any chance of a deal"". But he called for the EU to ""recognise the UK has got to be able to control its own laws - that's what people voted for - and we have also got to be able to control our waters and fishing rights"". The PM added: ""No sensible government is going to agree to a treaty that doesn't have those two basic things in it as well as everything else. ""Our door is open, we will keep talking, but I have to say that things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged. ""The UK has done a lot to try and help and we hope our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves."" Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and EU. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side, and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full as hospitals try to cope with the demands of Covid in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. This could result in some trusts facing the decision to stop non-Covid work. Rises in hospital admissions are particularly affecting areas in the south. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending December 13. This is the highest occupancy rate so far this year - it's still lower than the same time last year, although the extra burden of Covid is likely to make hospitals feel they are much busier. A safe level for bed occupancy is below 90% but nearly half of NHS trusts report a figure currently higher than this - the largest proportion this season. The south and east of England are facing the most pressure on beds. Across England, individual hospitals and trusts are coping with varying levels of pressure, and these can change daily. Trusts in and around London make up most of the busiest ranked by beds occupied - all of the top 10 are over 95%, with three running even higher at over 97%. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She said the combination of staff who are tired, unwell or having to isolate, and the additional burden of Covid, was an ""awful situation"" to be in. She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. ""We have to get a grip of the virus and do whatever it takes,"" Dr Henderson added. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said he suspected ""many, many trusts"" had already cancelled routine clinics or procedures to try to free up staff for the challenges of winter. ""What we do know is that the country is in the grip of one crisis and is about to embark on another in the coming weeks, and the fact we will see a festive period with families mixing strikes fear into the hearts of clinicians on the frontline,"" he said. Recent rises in numbers of people admitted to hospital with Covid are putting major pressure on other hospital work. For example,Leicester's hospitals are now on the highest level of alertwhilethree in Essex have stopped non-urgent operationsdue to the number of Covid-19 cases. It also means critical care is getting busier in England, with three-quarters of of adult critical care beds occupied last week - up slightly from the previous week. However, this figure was higher during the week ending 22 November in the midst of the second lockdown, when it hit 76.4%. Three NHS trusts reported their critical-care beds were 100% full - Calderdale and Huddersfield, Portsmouth Hospitals University and Sandwell and West Birmingham, in the week to 13 December. Delays in ambulances transferring patients over to emergency staff when they arrive at hospital are also causing knock-on problems. One in seven ambulances faced delays of 30 minutes doing this, affecting more than 13,000 patients. The target is to transfer patients within 15 minutes. The highest proportion of ambulance delays occurred in University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust (43%), Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust (42%) and North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (41%). However, ambulance delays are common during winter and this number is not particularly high for this time of year. By BBC Reality Check Like most front-line sectors, coronavirus has had an impact on staffing due to illness and self-isolation. Back in April, when the virus first peaked, the staff absence rate reached 6.2% - the highest on record. This means that more than one in 20 working days were lost to illness. Roughly a third of these were lost due to coronavirus. We don't have data coinciding with the most recent surge in cases , so we can't assess how well Kent and Medway - which is very much at the epicentre of the outbreak at the moment - is dealing with staffing. But when London was the centre of the crisis, sickness rates hit as high as 7.2%. With winter coming in, the pressures of coronavirus will add to what is already a difficult time of the year for staffing; over the past five years, January's absence rate has averaged at just under 5%. NHS Providers has pointed out that this is combined with already high staff vacancies, which stand at 85,000 in England. This is down from 110,000 in 2018. It is also worth mentioning that - with the exception of April - coronavirus has not been the leading cause of staff absences throughout the year. Burn-out, anxiety and other mental health issues equate to one in three sick days for NHS staff in most months.

"This video can not be played US Vice-President Mike Pence:  ""I didn't feel a thing"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has received the coronavirus vaccine live on TV, telling the audience and doctors: ""I didn't feel a thing."" The White House said the aim of the move was to ""promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people"". Mr Pence's wife and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received the jab at the televised White House event. On Monday the US began rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The first vaccine to be approved in the US, it offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The first three million doses are being distributed to locations across the 50 US states. President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, will receive the vaccine on Monday, a spokesperson told US media. Also on Friday,a second vaccine, developed by Moderna, received emergency approvalby the Food and Drug Administration after it was endorsed by a panel of experts. As Mr Pence was receiving his jab, Mr Trump incorrectly said on Twitter that the Moderna vaccine had been ""overwhelmingly approved"" with ""distribution to start immediately"". It is still awaiting final approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More than 310,000 people have died with coronavirus in the US, which has recorded more infections and fatalities than any other country.

He is the most senior US official to be vaccinated so far. ""We gather here today at the end of a historic week to affirm to the American people that hope is on the way,"" he told the crowd, after the number of newly recorded US coronavirus deaths surpassed 3,000 for the third day in a row. ""Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine that we have secured and produced for the American people,"" he continued, calling it ""a truly inspiring day"". Top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield were in the audience to observe the doctors from Walter Reed hospital perform the injections.

""By the time we get to several months into this [coming] year we will have enough people protected that we can start thinking seriously about the return to normality."" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had also received the vaccine on Friday. ""As the vaccine is being distributed, we must all continue mask wearing, social distancing & other science-based steps to save lives & crush the virus,"" tweeted Mrs Pelosi,alongside pictures of herself getting the jab,external.

The president, who contracted coronavirus in October and recovered after hospital treatment, said he was not scheduled to take the jab but looked forward to doing so ""at the appropriate time"". Many of his support base have doubts about the efficacy and safety of vaccines.

"The planets often cross paths on their journey around the Sun, but this conjunction is unusual Jupiter and Saturn have crossed paths in the night sky, appearing to the naked eye as a ""double planet"". The timing of this conjunction, as the celestial event is known, has caused some to suggest it may have been the source of a bright light in the sky 2,000 years ago. That became known as the Star of Bethlehem. The planets have been moving closer together each night and reached their closest point on 21 December. Keen stargazers in the UK have been keeping a close eye on the weather to avoid an astronomical disappointment. ""Any evening it's clear, it's worth grabbing a chance, because the weather doesn't look great,"" Dr Carolin Crawford from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy told the BBC. The spectacle was captured around the world on Monday, including this image in southern Spain The moon, Saturn and Jupiter formed a triangle over New York City There is a theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" Given a gap in the winter gloom, both planets would have appeared in the southwest sky, just above the horizon, shortly after sunset. With binoculars, Jupiter's moons can also be seen; this image was captured in Nairobi by Lennox Fevre Some astronomers and theologians think so. As Prof Eric M Vanden Eykel, a professor of religion from Ferrum College in Virginia,pointed out in an online article,externalthe timing hasÂ led to a lot of speculation ""about whether this could be the same astronomical event that the Bible reports led the wise men to Joseph, Mary and the newly born Jesus"". What was the star of Bethlehem? Light pollution's wasted energy seen from space Juno snaps giant Jupiter polar storms That is not just modern, festive speculation. The theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" was proposed in the early 17th Century byÂ Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer and mathematician. ""2,000 years ago, people were a lot more aware of what was happening in the night sky,"" said Dr Crawford, ""[so] it's not impossible that the Star of Bethlehem was a planetary alignment like this"". As planets cross paths on their journey around the Sun, conjunctions are not particularly rare, but this one is special. This video can not be played Close-up images of Nasa's Jupiter mission ""Conjunctions are great things to see - they happen fairly often - but [for the planets to be this close] is quite remarkable,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist from the University of Manchester, told BBC News. The two planets - the largest in the Solar System and some of the brightest objects visible in the night sky - have not been this close to each other in a dark sky for 800 years. Because of the timing of the planets setting in the southwest, Prof O'Brien said it had been necessary for stargazers to get out and observe the event as soon as the sky went dark. ""None of us is going to be around in another 400 years,"" he said, of the next observing opportunity.

"Ian Hopkins had been on sick leave Greater Manchester Police's chief constable has stood down after the force was placed into special measures. The force was put into an""advanced phase"" of monitoringon Thursday after inspectors found it had failed to record 80,000 crimes in a year. Ian Hopkins said he would step down with immediate effect. Home Secretary Priti Patel accused the region's mayor Andy Burnham of throwing the officer ""under the bus to save his own skin"". Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said it was left ""deeply troubled"" over how cases handled by GMP were closed without proper investigation. It saidabout 220 crimes a day went unrecordedin the year up to June 2020. Ina letter,externalto the chief constable and Mr Burnham last week, Ms Patelsaid the report ""paints a worrying picture""and she was ""deeply concerned"". But Mr Burnham accused her of failing to give""a fair and balanced picture"",externalof GMP. Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Baird told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the force's failures were ""outstandingly bad"". She said crimes like stalking and coercive control were ""profoundly traumatising"" and victims needed ""not only the support of police to get orders restraining the perpetrator and to take them to court, but they also need to be safeguarded and referred to appropriate victim's services"". She added that ""none of that was happening"" and vulnerable people had ""simply been deserted"". Regional mayor Andy Burnham oversees policing in Greater Manchester In a statement, Mr Hopkins,who had been on sick leave, said these were ""challenging times"" for GMP and he believed a chief constable should oversee the force's ""long-term strategic plan"" to address the issues raised from ""start to finish"". Mr Hopkins revealed on Wednesday he had been suffering fromlabyrinthitis,external- an inner-ear infection which affects balance - since the end of October. The news of the chief constable standing down had barely broken when reporters phones started buzzing with a message from Home Secretary Priti Patel's party political spokesman. ""It's no surprise that the Labour mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham has thrown a senior police officer under the bus to save his own skin,"" the message said. Last week, the MP wrote a blistering letter to Mr Burnham about GMP's performance, saying she was ""deeply concerned"". Her spokesman then sent the letter to journalists saying ""this is exactly what happens when Labour are in power - people are let down by them"". In reply, Mr Burnham pointed out Conservative government cuts had lost the force 2,000 police officers and 1,000 police staff. He also highlighted Ms Patel's department had failed todeport three members of an infamous Rochdale grooming gang. This political tension between populist heavyweights could possibly bring about better policing for the people of Manchester, but it seems more likely that they will lose out as the parties battle over who is responsible for the miserable performance of the force, instead of working together to improve things. Mr Hopkins said given his ill health, he would bring his retirement, which he was due to take in autumn 2021, forward. He has been chief constable of GMP since October 2015, leading a force of almost 7,000 officers. ""Throughout my career, I have been committed to achieving the best outcomes for the people I serve [and] the decision to stand down is not one I have taken lightly, but I feel the time is right,"" he said. Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green earlier called for Mr Burnham, who oversees policing in the region,to step down over the HMICFRS findings. The Labour mayor said while he had ""a regard"" for Mr Hopkins, ""now is the time for new leadership and a new era in our police force"". ""At the end of the day, it's public confidence in Greater Manchester Police that matters,"" he said. He said Mr Hopkins had led the force during ""one of the most difficult periods in its history"" and had dealt with budget cuts and ""complex threats"", such as the Manchester Arena terror attack, but GMP had not made the progress needed ""in other important areas"". Mr Burnham, who has responsibilities around the force's governance and budgets, said he ""did not run GMP on a day-to-day basis"" and his job was to hold it to account. ""At times, this essential task has been made too difficult by an overly defensive culture within GMP,"" he said. ""This needs to change if GMP is to develop the open learning culture that will allow the failures identified to be properly addressed."" Mr Burnham said deputy chief constable Ian Pilling would assume the operational duties of chief constable ahead of a full recruitment process. Stu Berry, the chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, said the issues that had been reported about the force's failures ""should not - and must not - detract from the efforts of our hard working officers"". He added that it had been ""an extremely busy, difficult and demanding year for Greater Manchester Police and our members have worked tremendously hard to keep our communities safe during this extraordinary Covid pandemic"".

"PM Boris Johnson says he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but that Covid-19 cases have increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. He chaired meetings on Friday, No 10 sources said, amid ""growing concerns"" about the spread of anew variant of Covidin south-east England. Health bosses have warned the NHS is already under significant pressure. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full, with coronavirus adding to normal winter demands. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the new strain and ministers have been discussing what action will be necessary to deal with this, sources said. Asked if people were going to be told to re-think their Christmas plans, a Downing Street source said: ""We are not there yet."" A separate government source suggested that travel restrictions were discussed, but it is not clear that they have been signed off. On Monday Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Meanwhile, the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto - has risen above 1 in the UK. The latest figure,calculated by the government's scientific advisers,,externalis estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, up from between 0.9 and 1 last week. The UK recorded a further 28,507 cases on Friday, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, said England and Scotland needed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a grip of the virus, even if that meant ""full lockdown"". Asked whether England would end up following Northern Ireland and Wales into lockdown, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously we are hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He said the Christmas rules, which are being relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, were ""very much a maximum"" and ""not a target people should aim for"". The prime minister encouraged people to ""think about our elderly relatives"" to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over Christmas. He added that he hoped next year, with the rollout of the vaccine, would ""be very different indeed"". Earlier, hetweeted a message,externalwarning people planning to form ""Christmas bubbles"" in the UK to start minimising contact with people from outside their households from today. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""nobody wants a third lockdown"" but England's tiered system was ""not strong enough"". He called for the prime minister to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households, instead of three, was a ""step in the right direction"". Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team's modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said he was ""more concerned"" about what the country was going to be facing in early January than over the Christmas period itself. The epidemiologist from Imperial College London told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that very rapid increases in case numbers had left ""very little headroom"", adding that any future lockdown in England may have to be tougher than the one seen in November. Meanwhile,teaching unions have criticised the government's announcement that the return to secondary school in January will be staggeredto allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme. They say the move came too late for them to make the necessary preparations for testing. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has defended the plan, saying the government would provide support. It comes aftera tough new six-week lockdown was announced in Northern Irelandfrom 26 December. Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures were essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, with non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hair salons having to close. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the restrictions, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops, including supermarkets, having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. In Wales,non-essential shops will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. In England, some 38 million people will be subject to the nation's strictest measures - tier three - from Saturday. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the option for a post-Christmas lockdown in Scotland ""remains on the table"". Meanwhile, documents released by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period - of a week or more - would reduce the risk even further. A document dated 26 November says taking a rapid coronavirus test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce the risk. Sage says mixing between households over the festive period for one or two days would be less risky than multiple households spending the entire time together. But the documents warn there may be a higher proportion of cases in more vulnerable age groups during the festive period, which could lead to an increase in hospital admissions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concern that it will fuel a further surge in case numbers. Average NHS bed occupancy in England has reached almost 89% for the week ending 13 December, with 59 out of 126 NHS trusts reporting bed occupancy of higher than 90% - which is above the recommended safe level. Dr Katherine Henderson told BBC News the UK was at a ""really dangerous point where we could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage"" and her colleagues were ""increasingly"" seeing ambulances queuing outside hospitals. In Northern Ireland, Dr Martin Kelly, a consultant respiratory physician in Londonderry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Right in the mouth of Christmas we're seeing a significant further surge in numbers which is already putting the service under significant pressure."" And Dr Nick Lyons, a health board medical director in south Wales, said things were similar in his region, where non-urgent procedures have been cancelled.

"PM Boris Johnson says he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but that Covid-19 cases have increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. He chaired meetings on Friday, No 10 sources said, amid ""growing concerns"" about the spread of anew variant of Covidin south-east England. Health bosses have warned the NHS is already under significant pressure. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full, with coronavirus adding to normal winter demands. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the new strain and ministers have been discussing what action will be necessary to deal with this, sources said. Asked if people were going to be told to re-think their Christmas plans, a Downing Street source said: ""We are not there yet."" A separate government source suggested that travel restrictions were discussed, but it is not clear that they have been signed off. On Monday Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Meanwhile, the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto - has risen above 1 in the UK. The latest figure,calculated by the government's scientific advisers,,externalis estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, up from between 0.9 and 1 last week. The UK recorded a further 28,507 cases on Friday, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, said England and Scotland needed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a grip of the virus, even if that meant ""full lockdown"". Asked whether England would end up following Northern Ireland and Wales into lockdown, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously we are hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He said the Christmas rules, which are being relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, were ""very much a maximum"" and ""not a target people should aim for"". The prime minister encouraged people to ""think about our elderly relatives"" to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over Christmas. He added that he hoped next year, with the rollout of the vaccine, would ""be very different indeed"". Earlier, hetweeted a message,externalwarning people planning to form ""Christmas bubbles"" in the UK to start minimising contact with people from outside their households from today. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""nobody wants a third lockdown"" but England's tiered system was ""not strong enough"". He called for the prime minister to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households, instead of three, was a ""step in the right direction"". Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team's modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said he was ""more concerned"" about what the country was going to be facing in early January than over the Christmas period itself. The epidemiologist from Imperial College London told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that very rapid increases in case numbers had left ""very little headroom"", adding that any future lockdown in England may have to be tougher than the one seen in November. Meanwhile,teaching unions have criticised the government's announcement that the return to secondary school in January will be staggeredto allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme. They say the move came too late for them to make the necessary preparations for testing. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has defended the plan, saying the government would provide support. It comes aftera tough new six-week lockdown was announced in Northern Irelandfrom 26 December. Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures were essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, with non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hair salons having to close. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the restrictions, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops, including supermarkets, having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. In Wales,non-essential shops will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. In England, some 38 million people will be subject to the nation's strictest measures - tier three - from Saturday. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the option for a post-Christmas lockdown in Scotland ""remains on the table"". Meanwhile, documents released by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period - of a week or more - would reduce the risk even further. A document dated 26 November says taking a rapid coronavirus test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce the risk. Sage says mixing between households over the festive period for one or two days would be less risky than multiple households spending the entire time together. But the documents warn there may be a higher proportion of cases in more vulnerable age groups during the festive period, which could lead to an increase in hospital admissions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concern that it will fuel a further surge in case numbers. Average NHS bed occupancy in England has reached almost 89% for the week ending 13 December, with 59 out of 126 NHS trusts reporting bed occupancy of higher than 90% - which is above the recommended safe level. Dr Katherine Henderson told BBC News the UK was at a ""really dangerous point where we could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage"" and her colleagues were ""increasingly"" seeing ambulances queuing outside hospitals. In Northern Ireland, Dr Martin Kelly, a consultant respiratory physician in Londonderry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Right in the mouth of Christmas we're seeing a significant further surge in numbers which is already putting the service under significant pressure."" And Dr Nick Lyons, a health board medical director in south Wales, said things were similar in his region, where non-urgent procedures have been cancelled. The intensive care units ""were basically full with Covid patients"" while the area's field hospital was ""roughly at half its total capacity"", he told Today.

"Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is currently Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy Scotland generated enough electricity from renewable sources last year to meet the equivalent of 90.1% of its total electricity consumption, according to latest figures. The Scottish government data for 2019 showed an increase of 13.4% on 2018 - meaning the country generated 30.5 TWh of electricity from renewable sources. That's enough to charge almost 6.7bn mobile phones for a year, or boil about 700bn kettles. The target is for 100% of the country's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by the end of 2020. And good progress is being made - in 2009, it was only 27.2%. But we won't know whether Scotland has met this target or not until more data is published next year. Although electricity only makes up part of the mix of the energy Scotland needs, the amount of energy produced in Scotland from renewable resources increased between 2017 and 2018 to 21.1%. The Scottish government said to decarbonise energy-intensive industries, heating buildings and transport, renewable electricity supplies would need to be further enhanced. By 2030, Scottish ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50%,externalof energy demand across electricity, heat and transport. In order to achieve the target, Scotland has been moving away from burning fossil fuels, with the last coal-fired power station,Longannet, closing in 2016. The only remaining gas-fired power station is at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Can Scotland ever be 'the Saudi Arabia of renewables'? Onshore wind delivers about 70% of capacity, followed by hydro and offshore wind as Scotland's main sources of renewable power. Scotland's largest single source is the Beatrice offshore wind farm. Its 84 turbines - each with three 75m (246ft) blades - went into operation last year. The wind farm isis capable of generating enough power for 450,000 homes.,external The Seagreen Wind Farm, under construction off Angus, will eventually be even bigger andable to power 1.3m homes,external. This video can not be played What is climate change? While the pandemic has led to a temporary dip in greenhouse gas emissions, there is still requirement for fundamental changes in the way we live our lives in order to achieve net zero. Net zero means any emissions will be balanced out by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - such as planting trees, or using technology to capture carbon and store it. So what are Scotland's climate change targets, and are they the most ambitious in the worldas has been claimed,external? The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target tocut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of thedate set for the UK as a whole.,external The Scottish government says its targets are ""the toughest anywhere in the world"". They are certainly among the most ambitious. However, other countries -such as Sweden,external- have passed legislation with the same goal. Sweden did so two years before Scotland, and it has also set milestones along the way. But Scotland's milestone targets are more ambitious and include emissions from aviation and shipping. They also don't rely on international credits, which is wherecountries can pay for emissions to be reduced,externalelsewhere instead of reducing their own. Much progress has been made, but the hardest changes are still to come. Emissions of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide - have been cut toabout half of what they were 30 years ago,external. Answers to your questions about climate change However,experts say,externalmuch of this progress has been accomplished by picking off the ""low hanging fruit"" - the most cost effective or publicly-acceptable changes to make. The areas that need tackling are transport (about a third of all emissions), farming and land use (about a quarter), business and heavy industry (about a fifth) and how we heat our homes. Tricky decisions will have to be made, especially with so much of Scotland's economy based around the oil and gas industry. A Scottish government-appointed commission is grappling with the question of how to protect the economy and ensure a ""just transition"" so oil workers and farmers don't lose out as the world moves away from fossil fuels. The commission has already published some advice to the Scottish government on how to make recovery from the pandemic greener. It saysimmediate actions that can be taken,externalinclude investing in warmer homes, supporting bus travel, and attaching green conditions to funding. This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Transport accounts for about a third of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions and some steps have been taken to reduce this but the overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road are still greenhouse gas-emitting petrol or diesel engines. The Scottish government has said,externalit wants to have ""phased out"" the need for new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and hopes to reduce the use of cars generally, with the number of kilometres driven to be reduced by 20%. There are now more than 1,500 publicly-available charge points in Scotland for electric vehicles and the number of new EV and hybrid cars registered in the UK was up nearly 40% on the same period last year. Should my next car be an electric one? But for many drivers an EV is prohibitively expensive and concerns over the range the cars can currently offer is a concern for some potential owners. Their popularity is expected to increase significantly as the technology gets better but this will see demand for electricity generation rise too. The UK government'sDepartment for Transport says,externalScotland now has more than 1,500 charging devices, and across the UK there are now more charging locations than petrol stations. Of course, this year has seen some huge changes to everyone's lives. During lockdown, the whole country was asked to stay at home unless leaving was essential. In Scotland, everyone who can work from home was asked to keep doing so. That has had a big impact on how often we travel, how far, and how we get to places - and as the number of Covid cases has risen, travel has dropped again. At the beginning of this month, compared with the same time last year,,externaltrain travel was down by 85%, air by 75%, concessionary bus travel by 60%, and ferry journeys by 55%. Despite the public being advised to avoid public transport where possible and not to car share, car journeys were still down by 25%. But the pandemic doesn't mean planning for a greener future has stopped. Low emission zones,externalthat will see polluting vehicles banned from entering city centres (and receive a penalty notice if they don't comply) are planned for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee but so far only Glasgow has introduced measures which only apply to 60% of buses that enter the zone. Because of the pandemic, implementing the low emission zones waspaused over the summer,external, but officials have vowed to see the changes through ""at the earliest possible time"". In a bid to discourage commuters from taking their cars to work, the Scottish government brought in theWorkplace Parking Levy. It allows councils to tax businesses on staff parking spaces but, so far, no councils have committed to introducing the levy this year. As well as cutting road transport emissions, the government needs to find a way to stop the growth in emissions from air travel. Since 1990, emissions from international aviation from Scotland have increased by 181% andthe latest data, from 2018,external, showed they were still increasing. The overall statistics have not been released yet to show the impact lockdown had on aviation emissions. But,according to the Global Carbon Project, the mass grounding of flights during the peak of the pandemic saw CO2 emissions from aviation reduced by up to 60%. The Scottish government has alsoscrapped plans to cut the amount of tax paid by passengers flying from Scottish airportsafter facing a backlash over the environmental impact. Electric-powered planes could be a solution to aviation emissions, but they are still at an early stage. Plans for the shortest scheduled flight in the world - the 1.7 mile jump between the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray -to use an electric-powered planecould happen soon. The UN sayshigh consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming, and researchers based in Scotland have been investigating ways of reducing the environmental impact of farming. For example, one group of scientists has found a way ofreducing the methane produced by cattle,external. About 15% of Scotland's emissions come from domestic housing, with most homes (about 80%) still relying on gas central heating systems. Ministers have set a target,externalof having 50% of all new heating systems being installed to be zero-emissions models by 2025. Instead of gas, heating systems should use renewable energy, or rely on low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps. And20,000 households have benefited,externalfrom better insulation and new, more efficient - although still often gas - heating systems, funded by the Scottish government. Trees are still the most effective way of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. To meet targets, the UK needsa net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland,externalplanted every year for the next 30 years - equating to about 1.5bn trees. Figures claim most of the trees planted in the UK were planted in Scotland -11,000 of the 13,700 hectares planted in 2019-20,external. By 2024,the Scottish government aims,externalto be creating 18,000 hectares of new woodlands per year, with the ultimate goal of having 21% of Scotland's land covered by forest by 2032 - compared to 19% today. But there's more to it than just planting trees- it's important that the right trees are planted in the right places, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, water levels, temperatures and the surrounding landscape and tree species.

"Mr Wightman has been a long-standing campaigner for land reform in Scotland A Scottish Greens MSP has quit the party over its ""alienating and provocative"" stance on trans rights. Andy Wightman said he had been threatened with possible expulsion over his concerns about the potential impact of the issue on women's rights. And he accused the party of being ""very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line"". A spokesman for the Scottish Greens said the party wished Mr Wightman well for the future. He added: ""The Scottish Greens are focused on building a greener and fairer Scotland that tackles the climate emergency, so Andy Wightman's decision not to be part of our movement anymore is a matter of deep disappointment. ""Land reform, empowering local democracy and community empowerment are core Green issues, and Andy's contribution has been very important, but the Greens remain committed to carrying on this agenda without him."" What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The dividing lines over Scotland's gender laws Scottish transgender reforms put on hold SNP politicians raise transgender law concerns Mr Wightman is a highly-respected land reform campaigner who has been an MSP for the Lothians since 2016. In a letter to Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, he said he had wanted to vote in favour of an amendment to the Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) Bill in the Scottish Parliament last week. But he said he instead voted against the amendment after it was made clear to him that he would face ""complaints and disciplinary action leading to possible suspension, deselection or expulsion"" if he did not do so. The amendment will give sexual assault victims the right to choose the sex, rather than just the gender, of the medical professional who examines them. Supporters say the change is necessary to prevent female rape victims potentially being intimately examined by trans women if they do not wish to be. It was overwhelmingly backed by MSPs in a vote last Thursday - with only the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats voting against. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie are both strong supporters of improving trans rights Mr Wightman said he had also been admonished last year for attending a public meeting in Edinburgh to hear concerns about the potential impact of gender recognition reforms on women's rights. He described being abused at the time on social media by some trans rights activists, and apologised for the ""distress"" he had caused party members by attending the meeting. In his resignation letter, Mr Wightman said he had been saddened for some time by the ""intolerance shown by some party members to an open and mature dialogue"" about the issue. He added: ""I understand that the Scottish Green Party has a strong commitment to equalities and trans rights. ""However, some of the language, approaches and postures of the party and its spokespeople have been provocative, alienating and confrontational for many women and men. ""It has become evident to me that the sort of open-minded public engagement I would like to see take place on this topic is incompatible with a party that has become very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line."" Mr Wightman will now sit as an independent MSP but said he remained committed to Green politics and would endeavour to ""work constructively"" with the party's five remaining MSPs until the election in May. Before being elected to parliament, Mr Wightman was best known for his Who Owns Scotland? book, which attempted to set out the amount of the country's land that was held by overseas interests, the aristocracy, companies, charitable bodies and the state. He has also campaigned for tighter restrictions to be placed on short-term holiday accommodation in Edinburgh. And he won a a defamation case earlier this year after Scottish Wildcat Haven attempted to sue him for Â£750,000 over statements he made in a blog post about the company's business practices. Proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act have been deeply controversial within Scottish politics, and the SNP in particular Controversy over the issue has centred on the Scottish government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender. The government believes the current process is intrusive and outdated, and wants to move to a ""self-declaration"" model which it says is needed to improve equality and help ensure transgender people are treated with dignity. The proposals would mean applicants would no longer need to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - distress as a result of a difference between their biological sex and theirÂ genderÂ identity - or have been living as their acquired gender for two years. The government has also been considering lowering the age that a person can apply to change their legally-recognised gender from 18 to 16. The plans, which are supported by trans rights campaigners and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, have proved to be deeply controversial within the SNP in particular, with activists and high-profile politicians on either side of the debate regularly attacking each other on social media. SNP MP Joanna Cherry has been among the most outspoken critics of the first minister's support for allowing people to self-identify their gender Critics of the proposals argue that allowing people to self-identify their gender could damage the legal protections given to women under the Equality Act - including the right to single-sex spaces such as changing rooms, and women-only shortlists. A group of 15 senior SNP politicians - including MP Joanna Cherry and MSP Kate Forbes, who is now the finance secretary -signed a letter last yearurging the first minister not to ""rush"" into ""changing the definition of male and female"". The letter was in response to Ms Sturgeon saying in a speech to the UN that ""some of the concerns that are expressed on the part of women and feminists are misplaced"".

The Scottish government subsequently announced that it was putting theproposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act on holdwhile further consultations were held in an attempt to build ""maximum consensus"" on the issue.

"Business and consumers across the UK are still facing worries that Christmas deliveries won't arrive on time. ""Some things haven't been delivered yet, and it's causing stress to people waiting,"" said Ellie Chalkley, who has an Etsy shop in Glasgow. With just a week till the festive celebration, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. ""All delivery companies are experiencing exceptionally high volumes this year,"" said the Royal Mail. It added that the majority of the Royal Mail network is now running as usual in line with the seasonal peak in demand. Problems have grown because of a huge increase in online Christmas shopping, partly driven by the recent lockdown, and the ongoing Covid restrictions. Price of first class stamps to rise 9p to 85p Ending Saturday post could save Royal Mail Â£225m Royal Mail parcels overtake letters for first time According to the online retail trade body the IMRG, sales for the first two weeks of December jumped by just over 50% compared to the previous year. ""We could not possibly have anticipated this level of packets and parcels, it seems to be intensifying every day,"" said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union. ""That coupled with the arrangements that are going to be in place to keep key workers safe because of COVID and the rising spread of COVID, is complicating what is already a strategical nightmare."" ""Anything that is sent to me via Royal Mail is arriving at least a week late,"" writer Geordie Clarke who lives in north London told the BBC. ""For the past six weeks I've had one postal delivery every week to 10 days for letters and cards, and parcels arrive whenever. ""For example, it took nine days for a 48-hour tracked parcel to arrive."" But financial adviser Andy Rainer, who lives in the Scottish Highlands, reported the opposite experience. ""We haven't experienced any problems, although we may be the lucky ones,"" he told the BBC. ""Parcels sent on Wednesday arrived yesterday. Christmas cards have been sent and received the following day."" The Royal Mail took on around 33,000 seasonal workers to help it cope with the increased demand as well as opening two extra temporary sorting centres. Even so, some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots fell behind, resulting in delays for customers. ""From the start, we have always said that despite our best endeavours, it is possible that some areas of the country may experience a reduction in service levels due to COVID-related absences and necessary social distancing measures at local mail centres and delivery offices,"" it said. Friday 18 December is the last recommended posting date for second class letters and packages, although there's no guarantee they will reach their destination on time. Monday 21 December is the last recommended posting date for first class deliveries although, again, there's no guarantee of timely delivery. Business owner Mariusz Luczakowski says he is frustrated with Royal Mail after customers complained about not receiving their deliveries on time Wednesday 23 December is the last chance to use Royal Mail's Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1pm the next day service in time for Christmas. It costs from Â£6.70 for a 100g letter, rising to Â£41.20 for a 20kg parcel. Royal Mail - along with other couriers - offers atracking,externalservice so you can follow the progress of your package. Mariusz Luczakowski runs a small chocolate company in Worcestershire and uses Royal Mail to send out orders to customers via first class delivery. Over the past few days he says he has received emails from customers complaining of delays - sometimes of seven or more days. ""I am feeling frustration, but at least it's not only me,"" he told the BBC. ""It is a really scary and uncertain time for a small business owner and so easy to destroy the reputation of your own company by not delivering on time as promised.""

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary.

"Covid case numbers are continuing to rise, withone in 18 Scots estimated to have had the virusin the week ending 24 June. Some experts believe this is being driven by the more infectious Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5. So what is the current guidance on Covid? The raft of restrictions put in place over the pandemic were lifted at the beginning of May as Scotland moved into the phase of ""living with Covid"". The current public health advice is to stay at home if you feel unwell or have a fever. People are also urged to avoid contact with others if they have the symptoms of respiratory infection and a high temperature or do not feel well enough to go to work. A GP should be contacted if symptoms worsen or if a person feels they can no longer manage their symptoms at home. The legal requirement to wear face coverings in shops, hospitality venues and on public transport in Scotlandcame to an end on 18 April. However, the Scottish government and health experts are still strongly advising people to continue to wear masks voluntarily in indoor settings or on public transport. The officially recognised symptoms for Covid have been updated. They now include: Fever New continuous cough Loss of sense of smell or taste Shortness of breath Unexplained tiredness Lack of energy Muscle aches or pains Unusual hunger Headaches Sore throat Stuffy or runny nose Diarrhoea Feeling sick or being sick Most people no longer need to test for Covid and free lateral flow home testing kits are no longer available for the general population. Testing remains available for certain groups such as health workers, social care workers, unpaid carers, people visiting care homes or those deemed to be at high risk. PCR testing sites have closed. People without symptoms are also no longer advised to take regular tests. For those who can demonstrate they are fully-vaccinated, for instance using a vaccine passport, most European countries and the USA are now open to travel and no pre-departure Covid test is required. If you are not fully vaccinated, you will still need a pre-departure test to travel to certain countries such as France, Spain, Portugal, Tunisia or the United Arab Emirates. Only US citizens or people with an exemption can enter the USA if they are not fully-vaccinated. Some countries may accept evidence that you have recently recovered from Covid as an alternative to a vaccine certificate. Private companies offer paid-for testing services and a choice of rapid antigen testing or PCR testing which takes a little longer to process. Travellers should check which test type is acceptable to their destination country. The entry requirements can change at short notice, so travellers are advised to check with their airline or theForeign Office website.,external People who have Covid symptoms, a fever or are what the Scottish government describes as ""too unwell to carry out normal activities"" are being asked to stay at home until they get better. Those under the age of 18 with mild symptoms, such as a runny nose or slight cough, who are otherwise well do not need to stay at home and can go to school, college or childcare. People who still take Covid tests, such as NHS workers, and get a positive result will still be expected to isolate at home for five days after they take the test. Many people will no longer be infectious after this period. Contact tracing has ended and the Protect Scotland app no longer sends alerts - although people are advised to keep it on their phones in case it is required in future. The legal requirement for businesses totake steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens, ended on21 March. The vaccine passport scheme - which covers nightclubs and large events - ended on28 February. New guidance on working from home came into effect on31 January. This recommends that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home. The legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain settings, such as shops, ended on18 April. The last remaining restrictions inEnglandwere replaced by a""Living with Covid"" plan,external. People with Covid are no longer legally required to self-isolate, although the guidance is that those who test positive should stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days. The government suggests wearing a mask in ""crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet"". Patients are no longer required to wear masks in NHS hospitals, GP surgeries and emergency departments, unless they have suspected or confirmed Covid infection. Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport inWales, or in health and social care services - although they are recommended. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are still free until the end of July. Legal measures have been replaced by guidance inNorthern Ireland, which recommends that face masks are still worn in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings.

"Free range chickens were found to have Avian flu at a farm in Orkney A flock of chickens from an Orkney farm has been culled in Scotland's first serious case of bird flu since 2016. A six-mile (10km) control zone has been set up on the island of Sanday. Thirty-nine free range laying chickens died of bird flu and the 11 remaining birds in the affected flock were put down. The controls include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure and restrictions on bird gatherings. Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said the risk to human health from the H5N8 Avian Influenza was very low. Bird keepers have been urged to comply with an order to house birds that came in to effect on 14 December. Bird flu killed wild birds in three cases in south west England All captive birds in Britain to be kept indoors amid outbreak Fareham and Ryde swan cases confirmed The last case of the H5N8 strain was found in a dead peregrine falcon in Dumfries and Galloway four years ago. Other less serious strains of have been detected since then. Ms Voas said: ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers - whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds - must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection. ""Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons or other birds of prey or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline."" She added that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs. In theory, this strain could transmit to humans but as yet there have been no cases of it anywhere in the world. However, it is highly infectious for birds and so restrictions for keepers have been put in place to lock their birds inside and away from wild birds. This is more serious than the last case in 2016 when just a single wild peregrine falcon was infected. Clearly this time there has been transmission of the virus. Free range poultry can continue to be labelled as such for a while but if this goes on for more than 12 weeks they will have to be relabelled and that will effectively devalue them. It's an additional headache producers could do without just now with everything else that's going on. But it is absolutely worth stressing that there's no risk at all from eating properly cooked poultry or eggs. Because of the number of cases in Europe and in England the risk of bird flu is currently judged to be very high for wild birds, high for poultry where there is poor biosecurity and medium for poultry with protection measures in place. A number of swans were recently found dead near theHampshire coast and on the Isle of Wightand there were culls inWarwickshire and Worcestershire. Earlier cases have included two farms inNorfolk, East Angliaand awildlife centrein Gloucestershire.  All 10,500 turkeys at afarm in North Yorkshirewere  culled following an outbreak. Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said Scottish cases were not ""unexpected"" given the cases in wild and captive birds elsewhere in the UK. ""We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds,"" she added. NFU Scotland animal health policy manager Penny Middleton described it as ""disappointing"". ""It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers, whether they have one hen in the back garden or a large poultry business, to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of Avian Influenza and keep out the disease"", she said. ""It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease - both in domestic birds and in wild birds - at the earliest opportunity.""

"Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is currently Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy Scotland generated enough electricity from renewable sources last year to meet the equivalent of 90.1% of its total electricity consumption, according to latest figures. The Scottish government data for 2019 showed an increase of 13.4% on 2018 - meaning the country generated 30.5 TWh of electricity from renewable sources. That's enough to charge almost 6.7bn mobile phones for a year, or boil about 700bn kettles. The target is for 100% of the country's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by the end of 2020. And good progress is being made - in 2009, it was only 27.2%. But we won't know whether Scotland has met this target or not until more data is published next year. Although electricity only makes up part of the mix of the energy Scotland needs, the amount of energy produced in Scotland from renewable resources increased between 2017 and 2018 to 21.1%. The Scottish government said to decarbonise energy-intensive industries, heating buildings and transport, renewable electricity supplies would need to be further enhanced. By 2030, Scottish ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50%,externalof energy demand across electricity, heat and transport. In order to achieve the target, Scotland has been moving away from burning fossil fuels, with the last coal-fired power station,Longannet, closing in 2016. The only remaining gas-fired power station is at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Can Scotland ever be 'the Saudi Arabia of renewables'? Onshore wind delivers about 70% of capacity, followed by hydro and offshore wind as Scotland's main sources of renewable power. Scotland's largest single source is the Beatrice offshore wind farm. Its 84 turbines - each with three 75m (246ft) blades - went into operation last year. The wind farm isis capable of generating enough power for 450,000 homes.,external The Seagreen Wind Farm, under construction off Angus, will eventually be even bigger andable to power 1.3m homes,external.

While the pandemic has led to a temporary dip in greenhouse gas emissions, there is still requirement for fundamental changes in the way we live our lives in order to achieve net zero. Net zero means any emissions will be balanced out by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - such as planting trees, or using technology to capture carbon and store it. So what are Scotland's climate change targets, and are they the most ambitious in the worldas has been claimed,external? The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target tocut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of thedate set for the UK as a whole.,external The Scottish government says its targets are ""the toughest anywhere in the world"". They are certainly among the most ambitious. However, other countries -such as Sweden,external- have passed legislation with the same goal. Sweden did so two years before Scotland, and it has also set milestones along the way. But Scotland's milestone targets are more ambitious and include emissions from aviation and shipping. They also don't rely on international credits, which is wherecountries can pay for emissions to be reduced,externalelsewhere instead of reducing their own. Much progress has been made, but the hardest changes are still to come. Emissions of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide - have been cut toabout half of what they were 30 years ago,external. Answers to your questions about climate change However,experts say,externalmuch of this progress has been accomplished by picking off the ""low hanging fruit"" - the most cost effective or publicly-acceptable changes to make. The areas that need tackling are transport (about a third of all emissions), farming and land use (about a quarter), business and heavy industry (about a fifth) and how we heat our homes. Tricky decisions will have to be made, especially with so much of Scotland's economy based around the oil and gas industry. A Scottish government-appointed commission is grappling with the question of how to protect the economy and ensure a ""just transition"" so oil workers and farmers don't lose out as the world moves away from fossil fuels. The commission has already published some advice to the Scottish government on how to make recovery from the pandemic greener. It saysimmediate actions that can be taken,externalinclude investing in warmer homes, supporting bus travel, and attaching green conditions to funding. This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Transport accounts for about a third of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions and some steps have been taken to reduce this but the overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road are still greenhouse gas-emitting petrol or diesel engines. The Scottish government has said,externalit wants to have ""phased out"" the need for new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and hopes to reduce the use of cars generally, with the number of kilometres driven to be reduced by 20%. There are now more than 1,500 publicly-available charge points in Scotland for electric vehicles and the number of new EV and hybrid cars registered in the UK was up nearly 40% on the same period last year. Should my next car be an electric one? But for many drivers an EV is prohibitively expensive and concerns over the range the cars can currently offer is a concern for some potential owners. Their popularity is expected to increase significantly as the technology gets better but this will see demand for electricity generation rise too. The UK government'sDepartment for Transport says,externalScotland now has more than 1,500 charging devices, and across the UK there are now more charging locations than petrol stations. Of course, this year has seen some huge changes to everyone's lives. During lockdown, the whole country was asked to stay at home unless leaving was essential. In Scotland, everyone who can work from home was asked to keep doing so. That has had a big impact on how often we travel, how far, and how we get to places - and as the number of Covid cases has risen, travel has dropped again. At the beginning of this month, compared with the same time last year,,externaltrain travel was down by 85%, air by 75%, concessionary bus travel by 60%, and ferry journeys by 55%. Despite the public being advised to avoid public transport where possible and not to car share, car journeys were still down by 25%. But the pandemic doesn't mean planning for a greener future has stopped. Low emission zones,externalthat will see polluting vehicles banned from entering city centres (and receive a penalty notice if they don't comply) are planned for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee but so far only Glasgow has introduced measures which only apply to 60% of buses that enter the zone. Because of the pandemic, implementing the low emission zones waspaused over the summer,external, but officials have vowed to see the changes through ""at the earliest possible time"". In a bid to discourage commuters from taking their cars to work, the Scottish government brought in theWorkplace Parking Levy. It allows councils to tax businesses on staff parking spaces but, so far, no councils have committed to introducing the levy this year. As well as cutting road transport emissions, the government needs to find a way to stop the growth in emissions from air travel. Since 1990, emissions from international aviation from Scotland have increased by 181% andthe latest data, from 2018,external, showed they were still increasing. The overall statistics have not been released yet to show the impact lockdown had on aviation emissions. But,according to the Global Carbon Project, the mass grounding of flights during the peak of the pandemic saw CO2 emissions from aviation reduced by up to 60%. The Scottish government has alsoscrapped plans to cut the amount of tax paid by passengers flying from Scottish airportsafter facing a backlash over the environmental impact. Electric-powered planes could be a solution to aviation emissions, but they are still at an early stage. Plans for the shortest scheduled flight in the world - the 1.7 mile jump between the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray -to use an electric-powered planecould happen soon. The UN sayshigh consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming, and researchers based in Scotland have been investigating ways of reducing the environmental impact of farming. For example, one group of scientists has found a way ofreducing the methane produced by cattle,external. About 15% of Scotland's emissions come from domestic housing, with most homes (about 80%) still relying on gas central heating systems. Ministers have set a target,externalof having 50% of all new heating systems being installed to be zero-emissions models by 2025. Instead of gas, heating systems should use renewable energy, or rely on low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps. And20,000 households have benefited,externalfrom better insulation and new, more efficient - although still often gas - heating systems, funded by the Scottish government. Trees are still the most effective way of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. To meet targets, the UK needsa net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland,externalplanted every year for the next 30 years - equating to about 1.5bn trees. Figures claim most of the trees planted in the UK were planted in Scotland -11,000 of the 13,700 hectares planted in 2019-20,external. By 2024,the Scottish government aims,externalto be creating 18,000 hectares of new woodlands per year, with the ultimate goal of having 21% of Scotland's land covered by forest by 2032 - compared to 19% today. But there's more to it than just planting trees- it's important that the right trees are planted in the right places, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, water levels, temperatures and the surrounding landscape and tree species.

"Mr Wightman has been a long-standing campaigner for land reform in Scotland A Scottish Greens MSP has quit the party over its ""alienating and provocative"" stance on trans rights. Andy Wightman said he had been threatened with possible expulsion over his concerns about the potential impact of the issue on women's rights. And he accused the party of being ""very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line"". A spokesman for the Scottish Greens said the party wished Mr Wightman well for the future. He added: ""The Scottish Greens are focused on building a greener and fairer Scotland that tackles the climate emergency, so Andy Wightman's decision not to be part of our movement anymore is a matter of deep disappointment. ""Land reform, empowering local democracy and community empowerment are core Green issues, and Andy's contribution has been very important, but the Greens remain committed to carrying on this agenda without him."" What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The dividing lines over Scotland's gender laws Scottish transgender reforms put on hold SNP politicians raise transgender law concerns Mr Wightman is a highly-respected land reform campaigner who has been an MSP for the Lothians since 2016. In a letter to Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, he said he had wanted to vote in favour of an amendment to the Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) Bill in the Scottish Parliament last week. But he said he instead voted against the amendment after it was made clear to him that he would face ""complaints and disciplinary action leading to possible suspension, deselection or expulsion"" if he did not do so. The amendment will give sexual assault victims the right to choose the sex, rather than just the gender, of the medical professional who examines them. Supporters say the change is necessary to prevent female rape victims potentially being intimately examined by trans women if they do not wish to be. It was overwhelmingly backed by MSPs in a vote last Thursday - with only the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats voting against. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie are both strong supporters of improving trans rights Mr Wightman said he had also been admonished last year for attending a public meeting in Edinburgh to hear concerns about the potential impact of gender recognition reforms on women's rights. He described being abused at the time on social media by some trans rights activists, and apologised for the ""distress"" he had caused party members by attending the meeting. In his resignation letter, Mr Wightman said he had been saddened for some time by the ""intolerance shown by some party members to an open and mature dialogue"" about the issue. He added: ""I understand that the Scottish Green Party has a strong commitment to equalities and trans rights. ""However, some of the language, approaches and postures of the party and its spokespeople have been provocative, alienating and confrontational for many women and men. ""It has become evident to me that the sort of open-minded public engagement I would like to see take place on this topic is incompatible with a party that has become very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line."" Mr Wightman will now sit as an independent MSP but said he remained committed to Green politics and would endeavour to ""work constructively"" with the party's five remaining MSPs until the election in May. Before being elected to parliament, Mr Wightman was best known for his Who Owns Scotland? book, which attempted to set out the amount of the country's land that was held by overseas interests, the aristocracy, companies, charitable bodies and the state. He has also campaigned for tighter restrictions to be placed on short-term holiday accommodation in Edinburgh. And he won a a defamation case earlier this year after Scottish Wildcat Haven attempted to sue him for Â£750,000 over statements he made in a blog post about the company's business practices. Proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act have been deeply controversial within Scottish politics, and the SNP in particular Controversy over the issue has centred on the Scottish government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender. The government believes the current process is intrusive and outdated, and wants to move to a ""self-declaration"" model which it says is needed to improve equality and help ensure transgender people are treated with dignity. The proposals would mean applicants would no longer need to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - distress as a result of a difference between their biological sex and theirÂ genderÂ identity - or have been living as their acquired gender for two years. The government has also been considering lowering the age that a person can apply to change their legally-recognised gender from 18 to 16. The plans, which are supported by trans rights campaigners and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, have proved to be deeply controversial within the SNP in particular, with activists and high-profile politicians on either side of the debate regularly attacking each other on social media. SNP MP Joanna Cherry has been among the most outspoken critics of the first minister's support for allowing people to self-identify their gender Critics of the proposals argue that allowing people to self-identify their gender could damage the legal protections given to women under the Equality Act - including the right to single-sex spaces such as changing rooms, and women-only shortlists. A group of 15 senior SNP politicians - including MP Joanna Cherry and MSP Kate Forbes, who is now the finance secretary -signed a letter last yearurging the first minister not to ""rush"" into ""changing the definition of male and female"". The letter was in response to Ms Sturgeon saying in a speech to the UN that ""some of the concerns that are expressed on the part of women and feminists are misplaced"". The Scottish government subsequently announced that it was putting theproposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act on holdwhile further consultations were held in an attempt to build ""maximum consensus"" on the issue.

"NI's chief scientific adviser has said that without a six-week lockdown, the number of deaths and hospital admissions would be ""severe"". New measures will begin on 26 December with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" is allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there will be ""many deaths."" Lockdown would allow hospital staff to cope, he said. ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" Prof Young told BBC Radio Foyle. ""If you allow the epidemic to proceed in an uncontrolled way, you allow everybody if they choose to live their lives completely as normal with a dangerous virus in circulation, then inevitably there will be very severe consequences and many, many deaths."" Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. Mr Swann said the ""short, sharp interventions"" introduced in October had not worked, so the executive was returning to the level of restrictions which helped curb infection rates earlier in the year. The reproduction rate - or rate at which the virus spreads - is currently 1 to 1.2, but there are fears it could rise to between 1.4 and 1.8 over Christmas. Business organisations have warned the new lockdown could""sound the death knell"" for many firms. On Friday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and there were a further 510 cases of the virus. It brings the Department of Health's death toll to 1,166. In the Republic of Ireland, six virus-related deaths were recorded, with 582 new cases also confirmed. The Christmas gathering arrangements - where households have chosen to form a Christmas bubble for a period of time between 23 to 27 December with provision for travel a day either side when absolutely necessary - will be allowed to proceed. But during the first week of the lockdown, people are urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. Between 20:00 and 06:00 from 26 December until 2 January: All businesses, including essential shops, must close No indoor or outdoor gatherings of any kind will be permitted, including at sporting venues Outdoor exercise will be permitted only with members of your own household. No household mixing will be permitted in private gardens or indoors in any setting, except for emergencies or the provision of health or care services No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level Mr Swann said the measures were being brought in ""with a heavy heart"" and there was no intention to extend these advanced restrictions beyond the first week, as he was mindful of the effect the last year has had on lives and livelihoods. But he added: ""A heavy responsibility will rest on all of us to remain at home as much as possible over the course of the six-week period."" The restrictions for this period include: Closure of hospitality and non-essential retail with a stricter demarcation between essential and non-essential retail than that deployed during the recent circuit breaker Click-and-collect retail will not be permitted, and homeware will not be categorised as essential retail Off sales (including from bars) will be permitted from 08:00 on Monday to Saturday, and from 10:00 on Sunday, until 20:00 on any day Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery food Closure of close-contact businesses Places of worship can remain open under strict conditions MoT centres are expected to stay open Clarification is to be given on where vehicles can be washed ahead of MoT Tradespeople are expected to be allowed into homes for essential maintenance Childcare bubbles will continue Formal shielding will not resume, but ""stronger advice"" will be issued Justice Minister Naomi Long has confirmed that jury trials and other court and tribunal proceedings will go ahead during the lockdown, within public health guidelines. Mr Swann said discussions were taking place between the health and education departments over what additional factors could be put in place in schools, amid speculation as to when schools can return after the Christmas holiday. About a third of Northern Ireland's care homes - and 10,000 of their residents - had now received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccinations, he added, describing the vaccine rollout as the ""start of fighting back"". We've had the ""softly, softly"" approach - now it appears the executive is going to use the stick. The decision arrived at by ministers was, we're told, unanimous and they could not ignore the scenes of ambulances queued outside hospitals this week and severe pressures on the system. The changes mean Boxing Day and new year's celebrations are going to be nothing like what we've ever had before - the initial measures in the first week of lockdown are an attempt to clamp down on house parties and suppress the virus. But there's no doubt this will be a hard sell in some respects - getting people to wilfully comply with what effectively amounts to a curfew will be not be easy. We're told visibility of the police will also increase that week, but there's been little detail about additional enforcement. Northern Ireland is ending 2020 on a sombre note and going into 2021 with a difficult task ahead - to try to get back to a place where an unpredictable virus can be brought under some sort of control.

When occupancy rises above 90%, he said, there was an increased risk of harm to patients. ""This is a wave on a wave... and the risk is we swamp our health service,"" he warned. Pre-arranged Christmas bubbles can still go ahead Dr McBride urged people to behave as they did in March, when the restrictions and behaviour saw the R number fall from almost 3, down to 0.7 by July. In its modelling, the Department of Health said it anticipated case numbers would continue to rise as Christmas approached.

"The secure unit houses up to 87 boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 A secure centre for children involved in crimes has been holding them in near solitary confinement despite having been previously told to stop. Three watchdogs have ordered ministers to take urgent action against the Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre Boys and girls have been locked in their rooms there for almost 24 hours a day as a quarantine measure. Ofsted, HM Inspectorate of Prisons and the Care Quality Commission say the practice is unacceptable. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland now has 28 days to respond. Officials have confirmed they are aiming not to send any more children to Rainsbrook while urgent action is taken - and the contractor who runs the centre, MTC, says it recognises the severity of the findings. Rainsbrook, in Northamptonshire, is a secure training centre run by a private contractor, MTC. It holds some of the most vulnerable children in the criminal justice system - boys and girls convicted or awaiting trial for serious offences, who typically also have complex behavioural problems or other vulnerabilities, such as self-harming. The centre is designed to hold up to 87 children securely and also provide an education as close as possible to a school. Concerns about the treatment of children inside the centre became public earlier this month. Inspectors found during a visit in October that 15-year-olds arriving at the centre were being locked up for a fortnight of coronavirus quarantine - and only being allowed out for half an hour a day. The watchdogs then went back into the centre earlier this month - and found that little had changed, despite their highly critical report. Yet again, they found children being held in near-solitary confinement - and they described the picture as ""bleak"". Five children had been locked up for substantial periods of time. One girl had had no time at all out of her room on two days. A boy had only been allowed to leave his room for a total of four hours over 14 days. There was no evidence the children were receiving an adequate education and there was little encouragement given to them to get up in the morning or spend meaningful time with staff. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspector, said even with the risk of Covid, the children should have been allowed out at least four and a half hours a day/ ""Rainsbrook was warned that its treatment of newly admitted children was unacceptable, yet these concerns have been ignored,"" she said. ""Some of the most vulnerable children are being locked up for days on end, with little thought about their safety or well-being. Leaders and government must act now to address this."" And Charlie Taylor, HM Inspectorate of Prisons Chief Inspector, said: ""It is astonishing that in spite of our original findings, the Youth Custody Service and the centre had continued to allow children to be held in what amounted to solitary confinement, particularly after we had been assured that this was no longer the case."" The three watchdogs have now issued an ""urgent notification"" - the first time they have used their legal power to order the Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, to come back with an action plan to improve conditions in a STC. ""We have decided to invoke the urgent notification process because of the continued poor care experienced by children, the lack of leadership grip and lack of oversight of practice by local and national leaders,"" said Ms Spielman. ""Since 2015, every joint inspection has judged the centre as 'requires improvement to be good' with the effectiveness of leaders and managers being judged 'inadequate' on two occasions. This provides little confidence in the centre's capacity to improve the care, well-being and safety of children."" The MOJ says its Youth Custody Service asked MTC in August and September to consider allowing newly-arriving detainees to ""bubble"" so they could spend more time together. In early October, YCS officials visited Rainsbrook and noted bubbling plans were still not in place. When the independent watchdogs visited in October, and criticised the lock-ups, the YCS ordered the centre to change how children were being quarantined - but in November there was a Covid outbreak. The Ministry of Justice has its own monitor inside the centre, but it is not clear what was reported back to officials and ministers about the durations of the lock-ups. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said: ""These findings are incredibly concerning and disappointing, particularly as MTC gave repeated assurances that they would act on previous warnings. She said ""additional and experienced"" managers were being sent into the centre. While the MOJ does not intend to send children to the STC until there are improvements, it is the only centre in with a specialist teenage mother and baby unit. In a statement, MTC said it recognised the severity of the watchdog's findings. ""Following Ofsted's initial recommendations, we immediately installed new leadership and implemented measures to improve and strengthen governance and management oversight at the centre. ""We recognise there is more work to do to improve the centre and we do accept more should have been done during this challenging period.""

"A decision on whether stricter measures should be imposed after 27 December will be taken on Tuesday Scotland's health secretary has said all options remain on the table for Covid lockdown rules after the five-day Christmas easing period ends. There has been speculation that some areas of the country could have tighter restrictions imposed after 27 December. Jeane Freeman said nothing could be ""sensibly ruled out"" at this stage - with a decision due on Tuesday. She was speaking as three council areas prepared to move to a higher level of restrictions. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of Scotland'sfive-tiered system,externalfrom 18:00 on Friday. It means they will face stricter rules on movement, leisure and hospitality. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown Should you see your family at Christmas? What level of restrictions is your council in? The changes were announced on Tuesday, with the country's other 29 council areas remaining in their current levels. The move to level three means 500,000 people across the three areas will no longer be allowed to travel outside their own local authority boundaries unless it is classed as essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to completely stop serving alcohol, and must shut at 18:00. Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close, and indoor exercise, including gyms, will be restricted to individual workouts. Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian join 18 other councils in level three, meaning 80% of Scotland's population will now be under the level three restrictions. The Scottish Licensed Traders Association has warned that continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" The Scottish government is considering whether tougher lockdown rules should be imposed when the five-day Christmas easing period ends on 27 December. Cases of the virus are already increasing in some parts of the country, and are widely expected to spike in the new year as a result of the relaxed festive rules. Northern Ireland has already announced a new six-week lockdown from 26 December - while Wales will lockdown from 28 December, with reviews being carried every three weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but has admitted that Covid cases have already increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. Ms Freeman told the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing on Friday that the situation was currently better in Scotland, where she said hospitals were not under the same pressure as some other parts of the country. Pubs and other licensed premises in level three areas are not allowed to serve alcohol Ministers have previously said there will be no change to the current five-day period of more relaxed restrictions next week. But Ms Freeman said ""all options"" were still on the table after that, with a decision due to be announced on Tuesday. She added: ""I completely appreciate that everyone would love to know today what next week is going to be like. ""But it is not possible in the way that this virus operates, and the importance of looking really closely and carefully at the information we have and then using that to reach the best judgements we can make, for us to be able to do that at this point."" Christmas guidance to be toughened in Scotland What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Prof James Chalmers, of the University of Dundee, toldthe BBC's Good Morning Scotlandhe believed the Scottish government should have ""reversed"" the decision to relax measures over Christmas - and that Scotland was ""on course"" for another national lockdown. He said: ""I think if we continue on the current course that we have high levels of cases across the UK and Scotland and then we have a relaxation over Christmas, we're looking at a spike in cases in early January. ""The only way we've seen over the last year to control a big spike is to have national lockdowns so I think we're heading in the direction of a lockdown unless there's a change in policy."" New analysis released on Thursday suggested that the R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is spreading in Scotland - was now between 0.9 and 1.1. This was an increase from the previous week's report, which estimated R to be between 0.7 and 0.9. Meanwhile, NHS Borders has also warned that a rise in cases meant the region's infection rates are""no longer consistent"" with level one restrictions. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The planets often cross paths on their journey around the Sun, but this conjunction is unusual Jupiter and Saturn have crossed paths in the night sky, appearing to the naked eye as a ""double planet"". The timing of this conjunction, as the celestial event is known, has caused some to suggest it may have been the source of a bright light in the sky 2,000 years ago. That became known as the Star of Bethlehem. The planets have been moving closer together each night and reached their closest point on 21 December. Keen stargazers in the UK have been keeping a close eye on the weather to avoid an astronomical disappointment. ""Any evening it's clear, it's worth grabbing a chance, because the weather doesn't look great,"" Dr Carolin Crawford from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy told the BBC. The spectacle was captured around the world on Monday, including this image in southern Spain The moon, Saturn and Jupiter formed a triangle over New York City There is a theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" Given a gap in the winter gloom, both planets would have appeared in the southwest sky, just above the horizon, shortly after sunset. With binoculars, Jupiter's moons can also be seen; this image was captured in Nairobi by Lennox Fevre Some astronomers and theologians think so. As Prof Eric M Vanden Eykel, a professor of religion from Ferrum College in Virginia,pointed out in an online article,externalthe timing hasÂ led to a lot of speculation ""about whether this could be the same astronomical event that the Bible reports led the wise men to Joseph, Mary and the newly born Jesus"". What was the star of Bethlehem? Light pollution's wasted energy seen from space Juno snaps giant Jupiter polar storms That is not just modern, festive speculation. The theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" was proposed in the early 17th Century byÂ Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer and mathematician. ""2,000 years ago, people were a lot more aware of what was happening in the night sky,"" said Dr Crawford, ""[so] it's not impossible that the Star of Bethlehem was a planetary alignment like this"". As planets cross paths on their journey around the Sun, conjunctions are not particularly rare, but this one is special. This video can not be played Close-up images of Nasa's Jupiter mission ""Conjunctions are great things to see - they happen fairly often - but [for the planets to be this close] is quite remarkable,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist from the University of Manchester, told BBC News. The two planets - the largest in the Solar System and some of the brightest objects visible in the night sky - have not been this close to each other in a dark sky for 800 years. Because of the timing of the planets setting in the southwest, Prof O'Brien said it had been necessary for stargazers to get out and observe the event as soon as the sky went dark. ""None of us is going to be around in another 400 years,"" he said, of the next observing opportunity.

"Andy Burnham oversees policing in Greater Manchester Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham should resign after the region's police force was placed in special measures, an MP has said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was placed into an""advanced phase"" of monitoringon Thursday after it failed to record 80,000 crimes in a year. Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green said Mr Burnham, who oversees policing in the area, should step down. The Labour mayor said he would not be stepping down. On Friday, GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkinsannounced his resignationwith immediate effect. He previously announced he would begoing on sick leaveafter suffering from labyrinthitis - an inner-ear infection which affects your balance - since the end of October. Asked why it was the chief constable who had stepped down and not him, Mr Burnham said: ""Because I do not run Greater Manchester Police. ""The police service is operationally independent from politicians and rightly so. My job is different. I have to hold the police to account for the services they provide to the Greater Manchester public, and I am here today doing my job holding the police service to account."" Inspectors said Greater Manchester Police's service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"" In a report last week, inspectors said GMP's service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services saidabout 220 crimes a day went unrecordedin the year up to June 2020. Inspectors found officers prematurely closed some cases without a full investigation, while the force did not properly record evidence that victims supported the decisions, particularly in cases of domestic abuse. A spokesman for the inspectorate confirmed GMP had been placed in the ""engage"" stage of its monitoring process. This means the force, the second largest in England, must ""develop an improvement plan to address the specific causes of concern"". As part of his role, Mr Burnham has responsibilities around the governance and budgets relating to GMP, supported by Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor for policing and crime. Earlier, Mr Green said Mr Burnham should ""resign now"" as he has ""absolute responsibility for policing, its failures"". ""His role ultimately is to ensure that GMP is delivering. He is in a position if he doesn't think GMP is performing and is delivering then he can challenge and if necessary he can sack the chief of police,"" he said. ""That is Andy Burnham's power over policing in Manchester. He has absolute authority."" Following the publication of the report earlier in the week, Mr Burnham apologised on behalf of GMP. ""I would like to say sorry to all of the victims of crime who have found that the service has not been good enough. We owe it to them to improve and we will and we will do it fast,"" he said. Former GMP detective Maggie Oliver said victims were being ""fobbed off and failed"" Former GMP detective Maggie Oliver, whoresigned over the way grooming cases in Rochdale were handledby the force, said she and two ex-colleagues had a meeting with Mr Burnham in 2018 to highlight ""serious concerns"" and were ""treated with contempt"". She said they gave him 26 examples of victims being failed by GMP, including ""people dying as a result of gross neglect"" and he ""basically slammed the door in our face"". There was a ""culture of arrogance and cover-ups"" at the force, she said, and a ""radical overhaul"" was needed. Ms Oliver said victim's ""trust in the police had gone"" and her charity, the Maggie Oliver Foundation, was ""drowning in cries for help"" from people who ""have nowhere else to turn"". Greater Manchester's chief constable Ian Hopkins had been due to retire in Autumn 2021 Sir Richard Leese, Manchester City Council leader, said the watchdog's findings indicate there are ""major issues"" that need to be addressed. ""I think it kind of says it all that GMP so far have not put up a spokesperson to explain what the situation is, what's been going on,"" he added. In a statement released on Wednesday, the mayor and deputy mayor said they were ""putting in place the necessary actions to improve standards of service to victims of crime in Greater Manchester"". Mr Burnham announced that a dedicated hotline for victims who have any complaints was also being set up. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Former Det Insp Tim Ireson led the unit for two years Six members of a ""toxic"" police unit have been found guilty of gross misconduct after their ""offensive"" conversations were secretly recorded. Investigators bugged the Northern Serious Organised Crime Unit's office in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and analysed messages over a 24-day period in 2018. The Northern Serious Organised Crime Unit was ""homophobic, racist and sexist"", a misconduct panel heard. The panel is due to consider sanctions at a later date. Jason Beer QC, prosecuting, previously said a ""toxic, abhorrent culture"" had developed amongst some officers because of a ""lack of leadership"". He said vulgar language was the ""stock-in-trade"" of the unit, where the team's only black officer was often a target of abuse. Mr Beer said the accused men ""habitually"" made offensive remarks about women, black people, immigrants, disabled, gay and transgender people and foreign nationals. The six men were based at the Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Basingstoke The panel listed numerous instances where gross misconduct was committed. In one case, retired Det Insp Tim Ireson, who led the unit for two years, was described as failing to properly manage an officer who turned up for work drunk. Det Sgt Gregory Willcox failed to supervise the team, while Det Sgt Oliver Lage made ""highly offensive and racist comments"" about the black colleague, the panel found. Other instances of gross misconduct the panel recorded included PC Andrew Ferguson sending colleagues a fake pornographic image of members of the royal family, and former PC Craig Bannerman failing to challenge ""the most serious"" abuse recorded by investigators. Another of the accused officers, PC James Oldfield, interrupted the panel as the verdicts were read out, saying: ""Absolutely unbelievableâ¦ nonsense."" Hampshire Constabulary said disciplinary action was also taken against 14 other officers and police staff from the unit. In a statement, the force said the offences came to light when an anonymous source made allegations via its confidential reporting system. It said it would respond fully after the panel reconvenes on 4 January to consider sanctions. Michael Lane, Hampshire police and crime commissioner, said the ruling showed the six officers did not hold themselves to the ""highest standards of ethical behaviour"". He said: ""Hampshire Constabulary and I take, and have always taken, this matter very seriously."" Officers 'permitted toxic culture in police unit' Detective breaks down at misconduct hearing Offensive words 'widely used' in police force Police officer 'used work email' for football club Officers 'shared fake explicit images of royals' Police unit 'homophobic, racist and sexist' Hampshire Constabulary Southampton death notices: Tributes to 12 people who have died Watercress Festival returning with celebrity chefs and eating contest Planting the future - volunteering with Andover Trees See inside the Andover gaming shop thatâs growing from strength to strength Isle of Wight centenarian Peggy who owned Only Fools and Horses dog turns 100 Which Island pub was chosen as the best in the county?

"Food was one of the few sectors to see sales grow Store closures enforced by Covid curbs pushed down UK retail sales in November, figures have indicated. Sales fell by 3.8% last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, bringing to an end a six-month streak of rising trade. Clothing store sales saw a sharp fall from the previous month, the ONS said, while food stores and household goods stores were the only sectors that grew. Despite the monthly fall, overall sales remain above their pre-pandemic levels. ""After a run of strong growth, retail sales fell back in November as restrictions meant many stores had to close their doors again,"" said deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow. ""Clothing and fuel were particularly hit by the winter lockdown, with their sales falling sharply."" Mr Athow added that food sales, especially click-and-collect, were boosted as people were not able to eat out. Clothing and food prices fall in November lockdown Covid curbs scandalous, says Revolution Bars chief In another sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, online retailing accounted for 31.4% of the total, compared with 28.6% a year earlier. The ONS said feedback from businesses suggested that consumers had brought forward Christmas spending. ""In a month where England went back into lockdown and the UK as a whole was subject to tightening restrictions, it's little surprise that physical retail sales growth stalled in November,"" said Lynda Petherick, head of retail at Accenture UKI. Consumers had already brought forward Christmas spending, the ONS said ""However, the show must go on when it comes to Christmas shopping, and some retailers have triumphed by preparing their e-commerce operations for the boom in online sales. ""Black Friday and early festive shopping continued to stimulate a sector so desperately trying to build recovery momentum."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales will rebound in December, probably to a new record high, as people undertake their pre-Christmas shopping over a narrower time period than usual."" He pointed out that consumers had ""rushed back to the shops"" since non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen on 2 December. ""Retail sales, however, probably will struggle to improve on December's level next year, given that income support schemes will come to an end in April and people will rotate towards consuming more services again once they have been vaccinated. ""What's more, non-essential shops might well be forced to close again to contain a third wave of Covid-19 in January. The collapse of more traditional High Street retailers next year, therefore, seems inevitable."" Meanwhile, a separate survey by trade publication the Grocer has shed further light on how people's shopping habits have altered during the pandemic. The magazine's annual Top Products Survey, covering the 52 weeks to 5 September, found that supermarket purchases of alcohol had soared as people attempted to compensate for their inability to go to the pub during lockdown. Sales of lager were up more than a fifth on last year, adding more than Â£800m to the nation's grocery bill. Most-favoured brands included San Miguel, which saw sales growth of 63%, and perhaps surprisingly, the unfortunately named  Corona beer, up 40%. At the same time, sales of wine and spirits went up by Â£717m and Â£567m respectively. However, other products lost out. With people confined to their homes for much of the time, the UK bought 22% fewer cosmetics, while hairstyling products sagged by 18%. Sales of toothbrushes and deodorants both fell 10% for similar reasons.

"The Duchess of Sussex has settled a legal claim against a news agency that photographed her and her son, Archie, the High Court has heard. Splash News and Picture Agency - which is in administration - has agreed not to take photos of her, Prince Harry or Archie, should it resume trading. Meghan's solicitor said the photos were taken during a ""private family outing"" in a park in Canada. Splash administrators accepted the solicitor's comments. The pictures were taken in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on 20 January, using a long lens, and showed Meghan walking with her two dogs, with Archie in a baby sling. The duke and duchess had set up base in Canada at the time, after announcingtheir intention to step back as senior members of the Royal Familyand divide their time between the UK and North America. They later relocated toMeghan's home state of California. Harry and Meghan sue over 'drone photos' of son Prince Harry paid damages over photos of home Harry and Meghan issue media warning over photos Meghan brought privacy and data protection claims against Splash in March both in her own right and with her husband, Harry, on behalf of Archie. However, Splash UK went into administration on 1 July, after the claim had been issued and served. Mr Justice Nicklin heard details of the settlement at a remote High Court hearing. Meghan's solicitor, Jenny Afia, said that in light of the administration the parties had agreed to settle the claim against the agency, with Splash UK agreeing not to take any photographs of the couple or their son, should it come out of administration in the future. Ms Afia told the court the couple's case was that the taking of the photographs was an ""unlawful invasion of privacy"" and their subsequent syndication to the media violated their data protection rights. She said the couple held that when the photographs were taken, Meghan and Archie were on ""a private family outing in a remote rural setting and that there was no public interest in the photographs"". Ms Afia added it was the couple's case that, a day before the photographs were taken, a Splash photographer made ""a full reconnaissance inspection"" of their private home, ""walking around it looking to identify entry and exit points and putting his camera over the fence to take photographs"". Neil Allen, of the administrators of Splash UK, accepted ""all that Ms Afia has said"" on behalf of the agency. A spokesman for the parent company Splash said: ""Splash confirms that one of its former companies has agreed that, should it begin trading again, it will not take unauthorised photographs of the family of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."" A spokesman for Schillings, Meghan and Harry's legal representatives, said the settlement was ""a clear signal that unlawful, invasive and intrusive paparazzi behaviour will not be tolerated, and that the couple takes these matters seriously - just as any family would."" A simultaneous and similar claim against Splash US - Splash UK's American sister company - is continuing through the UK courts, the spokesman added. The duchess is also suing Associated Newspapers, publisher of The Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over publication of a letter the duchess wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. In October,she was granted a postponement of the trial,which had been due to be held in January, until autumn 2021.

"The number of people who have died with Covid in Wales has passed 3,000 according to Public Health Wales It has reported the deaths of 38 more people, taking the total to 3,011 There were 2,801 new cases of the virus reported Mental health minister Baroness Morgan is giving the Welsh Government's regular coronavirus briefing She urged people to ""behave sensibly"" over Christmas to avoid ""trouble"" in the new year There will be extra money to help businesses hit by new lockdown restrictions, she also announced Retail sales fell in November according to the Office for National Statistics, bringing to an end six months of rising trade Millions of people in England face tougher restrictions from Saturday, while a new lockdown begins on Boxing Day in Northern Ireland Richard Porter and Lola Mayor That's it from our live coverage this Friday. Here's a reminder of what's happened so far:  Remember, you can watch the press conference again by clicking on the video at the top of this page. Welsh minister Baroness Morgan has urged people to ""behave sensibly"" this Christmas to avoid further ""trouble"" in the new year. The number of households who can mix in Wales over Christmas has been cut from three to two (a person who lives alone can join too). But for people who are still undecided or planning to see loved-ones, here is a reminder of how to mix more safely. A study by Sage,,externalthe UK government's science advisory panel, found that if you double the number of people getting together, the odds of infection increase fourfold. And since the coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, passing around objects could post a risk - soSage recommends playing quiz-style games instead,external.

The former Beatle said he would be having the Covid vaccine, adding: ""I'd like to encourage people to get it too."" At the age of 78, McCartney is in the over-75s category, so will be in the third group of people to get vaccinated. And McCartney added that he doesn't expect next year's Glastonbury Festival to go ahead.

One of Wales's oldest women, 108-year-old Mary Keir, is among some of the first care home residents to receive the new Covid vaccine. The retired nurse was among 37 residents of the Awel Twyi care home in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire to receive their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine yesterday. âI was really happy to have the vaccine. Weâve been waiting for it to be ready,"" she said. Ms Keir worked as a ward sister at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff, during and after the Second World War. This is her second experience of a pandemic - after she lived through theSpanish flu outbreakin 1918. âThank God for the people who have been able to get it for us. Weâre very lucky. I now feel much safer and happier.â  More details are needed about the Welsh Government's latest business support scheme, says Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones. She says it also needs to be more targeted at the right businesses rather than âfirst come first servedâ. Minister Eluned Morgan earlier announced an additional Â£110m of funding for businesses hit by the latest restrictions. Ms Jones said: âWhat businesses are telling us is that itâs really
important to get the right support to the right businesses. ""One thing
that weâve been asking for in particular is to acknowledge that for some
businesses, they just need to stay closed until March, and we want to be sure
that this new package that the government is bringing forward is going to
enable those businesses to hibernate. âWe know now that the furlough scheme will be available and
that will be a big help, but businesses still have their fixed costs, rents to
pay, maintenance and so on.â Meanwhile, the latest Office for National
Statistics infection survey estimates the proportion of those testing
positive is continuing to rise in Wales. It took throat and nose swab tests from more than 19,847 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From the results, it estimates 33,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 4 December,
7,800 more than the week before. This is one in 90 people, or 1.1%
of the population. The survey found a total of 160
positive tests, in 143 people from 119 households over six weeks. Similar surveys suggest cases
have increased in England, where one in 95 people are estimated to be infected, with a
sharp rise in London. Wales needs to start the post-Christmas lockdown âas one
nationâ with the same rules, Eluned Morgan says. A number of Conservative MPs have written to the Welsh
Government saying the measures are disproportionate given lower numbers of
cases in some areas of north Wales. Welsh ministers have conceded that some regional variations may be
possible in the future. But Lady Morgan told the briefing: âI do
think itâs absolutely right that we look at places like Anglesey and Conwy
where the virus levels are low, but for the time being we are absolutely
determined to make sure we go into these restrictions as one nation. ""It
may be later that we think about phasing coming out at different levels but
that depends on how the virus behaves in the next few weeks.â She said people were âall inter-dependent as a nationâ
with the virus likely to move between areas. People have to ""behave sensibly"" over Christmas to avoid a
âvery hard timeâ in January, Eluned Morgan has told today's government briefing. âItâs absolutely in the hands of the Welsh public,â the mental health minister said. âWe can put measures in place and restrictions in place, but if
people donât respect them, then we can expect trouble ahead.â ""If we see this continue as it is we could be in for a
very hard time in the new year, so I would really urge people to take great
caution this Christmas, to behave sensibly, to follow the rules and if you
donât have to mix with other people, then please donât.â Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Away from the press conference, we've also been hearing from Nick Lyons, medical director of the Cwm Taf
Morgannwg Health Board. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 intensive care units in the health board were ""basically full"". Dr Lyons said there were 500 Covid patients
across their three main hospitals. On Thursdaythe board suspended non-urgent services. ""Our ITUs [intensive care units] are basically full with Covid
patients. ""All but the most urgent outpatient clinics and all but the most
urgent cancer surgery and clinically urgent surgery weâve had to cease,"" he said. Read more here  The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil is one of the hospitals affected We've had the latest data on coronavirus case rates from Public Health Wales. This map shows how many people have the virus in each local council area, compared to the population. An additional Â£110m is being offered
to businesses affected by the latest lockdown rules, the Welsh Government has announced. The cash is on top of the Â£340m
already announced at the end of November. Under the new restrictionsall non-essential shops will close from the evening of Christmas Eve, and all
hospitality premises by 18:00 on Christmas Day. The money will pay grants to
hospitality and non-essential shops through the business rates
system. Tourism, leisure and supply chain
businesses will be eligible for the same support if turnover has fallen by 40%
or more. Eluned Morgan said around Â£20m had already been paid out, adding that the
scheme offered more generous payments than the one in England. Opposition parties have criticised the Welsh Government for not yet allocating hundreds of millions of pounds in additional funding from the UK government. The seven-day rolling Covid case rate remains highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 1,128.9 per 100,000 people. It is followed by Bridgend on 952.1, Blaenau Gwent on 863.1, Neath Port Talbot at 850.6 and Newport at 837.9. Thirty-eight more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 3,011 according to Public Health Wales data. It also confirmed 2,801 new cases.  Mark Drakeford also toldNewscasthis own family were âdisappointedâ after heâd had to scale down his own Christmas plans. The law is being changed in Wales,limiting gatherings to two households(and another single person if they live alone). He asks Welsh people to show restraint in the coming days, saying the âvery cunning virusâ had accelerated through the country during the autumn and winter. But he warned that âsmall acts of selfishnessâ on an individual level were adding up to the problems seen in Wales. However, he said his family âabsolutely understand that if we're expecting this of other people then we have to live up to that ourselvesâ.  The first minister has predicted other parts of the UK
may need to follow Walesâs lead in introducing lockdown measures after
Christmas. Northern Ireland has already saida six-week lockdown will begin there on Boxing Day. Speaking to the BBCâsNewscastpodcast, Mark Drakeford said âas soon as you begin to lessen restrictions this virus finds a way to
begin circulating again.â Mr Drakeford defended the Welsh Governmentâs decision to take the
country out of a firebreak lockdown after 17 days, saying the short lockdown
âdid everything we had expected of it.â He said âif I was thinking about England I would be remembering what happened in March of last yearâ â saying âthe advice from Sage has always been that the earlier you act and the more sharply you act the better the impact will beâ. Hello

Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

Four of the nuns at Notre Dame of Elm Grove died on the same day. The home had been free of the virus for nine months,CBS News reported,external, citing Sister Debra Marie Sciano, provincial leader for School Sisters of Notre Dame Central Pacific Province. However, one nun tested positive on Thanksgiving Day and - despite precautions - several more confirmed cases followed.

In a joint statement they say âunanswered questionsâ remain, including about what staff are expected to do and what costs will be covered. Advice is being issued to all the head teachers, teachers, schools and colleges by the coalition to say if a decision is taken that they are unable to set up a testing system, based on the current plans, they will have support.

Last yearâs very much focused onChinaâs changing economy and developments with 5G technologies,external. This year, the majority of Chinaâs new phrases have obviously been
related to coronavirus. Government mouthpiece Peopleâs Daily says the Top
10 new words appearing in media outlets included âCovid-19 pandemicâ, âasymptomatic
casesâ and âmakeshift hospitalsâ. Terms also included âcontactless deliveryâ, as a result of people
increasingly shopping online, and âhealth QR codeâ â a digital code
proving someone is Covid-free that mobile users scan to enter buildings and
public transport. Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor Mass testing in Englandâs schools at the start of next term is âundeliverableâ due the chaotic and rushed nature of the announcement, according to a coalition of education unions, school governors, both college organisations and the Church of England Education service. In a joint statement they say âunanswered questionsâ remain, including about what staff are expected to do and what costs will be covered. Advice is being issued to all the head teachers, teachers, schools and colleges by the coalition to say if a decision is taken that they are unable to set up a testing system, based on the current plans, they will have support.

"Free range chickens were found to have Avian flu at a farm in Orkney A flock of chickens from an Orkney farm has been culled in Scotland's first serious case of bird flu since 2016. A six-mile (10km) control zone has been set up on the island of Sanday. Thirty-nine free range laying chickens died of bird flu and the 11 remaining birds in the affected flock were put down. The controls include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure and restrictions on bird gatherings. Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said the risk to human health from the H5N8 Avian Influenza was very low. Bird keepers have been urged to comply with an order to house birds that came in to effect on 14 December. Bird flu killed wild birds in three cases in south west England All captive birds in Britain to be kept indoors amid outbreak Fareham and Ryde swan cases confirmed The last case of the H5N8 strain was found in a dead peregrine falcon in Dumfries and Galloway four years ago. Other less serious strains of have been detected since then. Ms Voas said: ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers - whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds - must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection. ""Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons or other birds of prey or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline."" She added that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs. In theory, this strain could transmit to humans but as yet there have been no cases of it anywhere in the world. However, it is highly infectious for birds and so restrictions for keepers have been put in place to lock their birds inside and away from wild birds. This is more serious than the last case in 2016 when just a single wild peregrine falcon was infected. Clearly this time there has been transmission of the virus. Free range poultry can continue to be labelled as such for a while but if this goes on for more than 12 weeks they will have to be relabelled and that will effectively devalue them. It's an additional headache producers could do without just now with everything else that's going on. But it is absolutely worth stressing that there's no risk at all from eating properly cooked poultry or eggs. Because of the number of cases in Europe and in England the risk of bird flu is currently judged to be very high for wild birds, high for poultry where there is poor biosecurity and medium for poultry with protection measures in place. A number of swans were recently found dead near theHampshire coast and on the Isle of Wightand there were culls inWarwickshire and Worcestershire. Earlier cases have included two farms inNorfolk, East Angliaand awildlife centrein Gloucestershire.  All 10,500 turkeys at afarm in North Yorkshirewere  culled following an outbreak. Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said Scottish cases were not ""unexpected"" given the cases in wild and captive birds elsewhere in the UK. ""We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds,"" she added. NFU Scotland animal health policy manager Penny Middleton described it as ""disappointing"". ""It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers, whether they have one hen in the back garden or a large poultry business, to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of Avian Influenza and keep out the disease"", she said. ""It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease - both in domestic birds and in wild birds - at the earliest opportunity.""

"Boris Johnson says he hopes to avoid a third lockdown in England but warns infection rates have risen ""very much"" in recent weeks Northern Ireland has announced a new six-week coronavirus lockdown from 26 December Wales has already announced a three-week lockdown from 28 December and Scotland is considering tighter restrictions Ministers have defended plans for many pupils in England and Wales to have a staggered return post-Christmas Teachers say the announcement - designed to allow schools to set up Covid testing schemes - came too late A second vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts The head of the FDA said it would move ""rapidly"" to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing millions of doses to be shipped Globally there have been 75 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1.66 million deaths with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University If you are just joining us here are some of the headlines from across the UK today. That's all from our live coronavirus coverage for today. It has been edited by Chris Clayton and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and written by Francesca Gillett, David Walker, Paul Kirby and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

"PM Boris Johnson says he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but that Covid-19 cases have increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. He chaired meetings on Friday, No 10 sources said, amid ""growing concerns"" about the spread of anew variant of Covidin south-east England. Health bosses have warned the NHS is already under significant pressure. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full, with coronavirus adding to normal winter demands. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the new strain and ministers have been discussing what action will be necessary to deal with this, sources said. Asked if people were going to be told to re-think their Christmas plans, a Downing Street source said: ""We are not there yet."" A separate government source suggested that travel restrictions were discussed, but it is not clear that they have been signed off. On Monday Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Meanwhile, the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto - has risen above 1 in the UK. The latest figure,calculated by the government's scientific advisers,,externalis estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, up from between 0.9 and 1 last week. The UK recorded a further 28,507 cases on Friday, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, said England and Scotland needed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a grip of the virus, even if that meant ""full lockdown"". Asked whether England would end up following Northern Ireland and Wales into lockdown, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously we are hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He said the Christmas rules, which are being relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, were ""very much a maximum"" and ""not a target people should aim for"". The prime minister encouraged people to ""think about our elderly relatives"" to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over Christmas. He added that he hoped next year, with the rollout of the vaccine, would ""be very different indeed"". Earlier, hetweeted a message,externalwarning people planning to form ""Christmas bubbles"" in the UK to start minimising contact with people from outside their households from today. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""nobody wants a third lockdown"" but England's tiered system was ""not strong enough"". He called for the prime minister to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households, instead of three, was a ""step in the right direction"". Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team's modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said he was ""more concerned"" about what the country was going to be facing in early January than over the Christmas period itself. The epidemiologist from Imperial College London told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that very rapid increases in case numbers had left ""very little headroom"", adding that any future lockdown in England may have to be tougher than the one seen in November. Meanwhile,teaching unions have criticised the government's announcement that the return to secondary school in January will be staggeredto allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme. They say the move came too late for them to make the necessary preparations for testing. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has defended the plan, saying the government would provide support. It comes aftera tough new six-week lockdown was announced in Northern Irelandfrom 26 December. Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures were essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, with non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hair salons having to close. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the restrictions, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops, including supermarkets, having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. In Wales,non-essential shops will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. In England, some 38 million people will be subject to the nation's strictest measures - tier three - from Saturday. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the option for a post-Christmas lockdown in Scotland ""remains on the table"". Meanwhile, documents released by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period - of a week or more - would reduce the risk even further. A document dated 26 November says taking a rapid coronavirus test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce the risk. Sage says mixing between households over the festive period for one or two days would be less risky than multiple households spending the entire time together. But the documents warn there may be a higher proportion of cases in more vulnerable age groups during the festive period, which could lead to an increase in hospital admissions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concern that it will fuel a further surge in case numbers. Average NHS bed occupancy in England has reached almost 89% for the week ending 13 December, with 59 out of 126 NHS trusts reporting bed occupancy of higher than 90% - which is above the recommended safe level. Dr Katherine Henderson told BBC News the UK was at a ""really dangerous point where we could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage"" and her colleagues were ""increasingly"" seeing ambulances queuing outside hospitals. In Northern Ireland, Dr Martin Kelly, a consultant respiratory physician in Londonderry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Right in the mouth of Christmas we're seeing a significant further surge in numbers which is already putting the service under significant pressure."" And Dr Nick Lyons, a health board medical director in south Wales, said things were similar in his region, where non-urgent procedures have been cancelled. The intensive care units ""were basically full with Covid patients"" while the area's field hospital was ""roughly at half its total capacity"", he told Today.

"The UK's R - or reproduction - number is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the coronavirus epidemic is growing once again. Covid-19 cases have risen to an estimated 660,000 infections across the UK between 6-12 December. In England, the rise was driven by sharp increases in London, plus rises in the South East and East Midlands. But the proportion of people testing positive in the North West and Yorkshire has continued to fall. Roughly one in every 95 people had the virus across Britain last week. The previous week's figures suggested about 560,000 people had the virus across the UK - one in 115 people in England, one in 120 in Scotland, one in 175 in Wales and one in 235 in Northern Ireland. So weekly cases have gone up by about a fifth. Covid cases are broadly stable in Northern Ireland with about one in every 215 people testing positive, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. The R number tells you how fast the epidemic is growing or shrinking. Anything above one - indicating that each infection leads to more than one extra infection - means the epidemic is growing. What is the R number and how is it calculated? Prof Neil Ferguson, the influential epidemiologist from Imperial College London, told Radio 4's the World at One any future lockdown may have to be tougher than the one seen in England in November. He said he was ""more concerned about what we're going to be facing in early January than I am over the Christmas period itself. ""We're facing very rapid increases in case numbers over time and we have very little headroom - we've heard reports today that local hospitals that really are at their limits at the moment - as is typically the case in winter. So we just won't be able to allow case numbers to rise much further."" In England, there were increases in people testing positive in all age groups apart from 17-24-year-olds and 50-69-year-olds. The figures suggest infections maybe levelling off in teenagers and young adults. The highest proportions of Covid cases are now found in London and the East Midlands, followed by the North East and North West of England. Across the UK, restrictions are about to be loosened over the Christmas period. Prof Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said this policy, ""increasingly looks like the wrong decision at the wrong time. ""By allowing travel around the UK and changing guidance to allow household mixing indoors we are setting ourselves up for a miserable January with tough restrictions."" Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced new lockdowns to come into force immediately after this period of relaxation. Similar arrangements for England and Scotland have not been announced, but they also haven't been ruled out. What is happening to the UK's R number?

"Vehicles are stranded on the snow-covered Kanetsu expressway Rescuers are trying to free more than 1,000 vehicles which have been stranded on a highway for two days after a heavy snow storm struck Japan. Authorities have distributed food, fuel and blankets to the drivers on the Kanetsu expressway, which connects the capital Tokyo to Niigata, in the north. The snow, which began on Wednesday evening, has caused multiple traffic jams along the road. It has also left more than 10,000 homes in the north and west without power. A Kyodo News report said that there were multiple reports of congestion at different points of the Kanetsu expressway. The gridlock began when a trailer got stuck in snow on Wednesday night. Another Kyodo report, quoting police and highway operator East Nippon Expressway Co, said the traffic jam had stretched up to 16.5km (10 miles) along the road at one point. Officials have been using a combination of heavy machinery and physical labour to dig out the vehicles one by one, but around 1,000 cars were still stranded on the road as of Friday noon. ""We are trying our best to rescue drivers and passengers, we are ready to continue the operation through the night,"" a Niigata disaster management official told AFP on Thursday night. Food, fuel and blankets were distributed to drivers Another similar traffic jam also occurred in the nearby Joshinetsu Expressway which saw 300 vehicles stranded. That gridlock lasted from Wednesday to Thursday morning. According to the meteorological agency, the heavy snow - said to be this year's most intense cold spell - is expected to continue through the weekend. The country's prime minister Yoshihide Suga has called an emergency cabinet meeting and urged the public to be cautious.

"An average of 115 referrals from helpline calls were made each month between April and November The number of referrals from the NSPCC about child abuse has increased by 79% since the UK-wide lockdown was imposed, according to the charity's data. Calls to its helpline resulted in 923 referrals to police and social services between April and November. Almost a third related to neglect and the charity warned more children could be at risk over Christmas. Wales' children's commissioner said the pandemic had a ""real and significant"" impact on the most vulnerable children. One caller to NSPCC Cymru's hotline reported concerns their neighbour's son was being neglected. They said they could hear the father screaming and shouting obscenities towards his three-year-old son. Child abuse calls to NSPCC up 20% since lockdown Firebreak lockdown 'has hit charities hard' Lack of abuse support 'will lead to deaths' ""This led to the boy crying constantly. The parents have no concern for their child, I've noticed the boy is regularly left in the garden for hours on end unsupervised,"" said the caller. ""There is also an excess of bin bags all ripped in the back garden. I only noticed this because of the smell that was emanating from it. It makes me sad and upset seeing the boy treated like this."" Calls to the NSPCC have resulted in more referrals to police and social services A mother also called as she was worried about her own son, who lived with his father. ""The father is unable to have a proper conversation about anything. The house is always a mess with lots of rubbish everywhere and my son is normally left to fend for himself,"" she said. ""I'm worried about the impact this is having on his emotional wellbeing. I can't keep quiet about this anymore, it's really worrying me, what should I do?"" There was an average of 115 referrals from helpline calls made each month between April and November, compared to the pre-lockdown average of 64. NSPCC analysis of the data showed the level of concern about emotional abuse, neglect and physical abuse remained well above the pre-pandemic average across the UK. Kamaljit Thandi, head of the NSPCC helpline, said: ""It's no secret that this Christmas is going to be a very different one and, for thousands of children, being stuck at home for the holidays will be a terrifying thought."" Children's commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland, said people should trust their instincts and not delay speaking up. ""During a year where many have spent long periods unable to socialise with friends and unable to attend their nursery, school or youth group, some children will have spent more time in a home where they do not feel safe. ""With infection rates so high in our communities and no clear timeframe for getting back to normal life, it's even more important than usual that people look out for signs of child abuse and contact their local child protection team, or Childline, if they are worried."" NSPCC Cymru has urged the Welsh Government to encourage the public to be extra vigilant, especially during the Christmas holidays and while schools are closed, to ensure children and families ""get the help they need"". It also said the government needed to invest long-term funding to support children recovering from adverse and traumatic experiences during lockdown. The Welsh Government said it was committed to working with safeguarding partners to do everything possible to prevent and tackle child abuse and to support children who have experienced it. ""Our national action plan sets out clear actions to prevent child sexual abuse, to protect children at risk and to support abused children,"" a spokesperson said. ""It was published in 2019 and actions are to be completed by 31 December 2021. The existing plan sets out the next steps which would then be taken, including considering evidence from a review of its implementation, in consultation with stakeholders, to decide on next steps.""

"PM Boris Johnson says he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but that Covid-19 cases have increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. He chaired meetings on Friday, No 10 sources said, amid ""growing concerns"" about the spread of anew variant of Covidin south-east England. Health bosses have warned the NHS is already under significant pressure. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full, with coronavirus adding to normal winter demands. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the new strain and ministers have been discussing what action will be necessary to deal with this, sources said. Asked if people were going to be told to re-think their Christmas plans, a Downing Street source said: ""We are not there yet."" A separate government source suggested that travel restrictions were discussed, but it is not clear that they have been signed off. On Monday Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Meanwhile, the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto - has risen above 1 in the UK. The latest figure,calculated by the government's scientific advisers,,externalis estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, up from between 0.9 and 1 last week. The UK recorded a further 28,507 cases on Friday, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, said England and Scotland needed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a grip of the virus, even if that meant ""full lockdown"". Asked whether England would end up following Northern Ireland and Wales into lockdown, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously we are hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He said the Christmas rules, which are being relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, were ""very much a maximum"" and ""not a target people should aim for"". The prime minister encouraged people to ""think about our elderly relatives"" to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over Christmas. He added that he hoped next year, with the rollout of the vaccine, would ""be very different indeed"". Earlier, hetweeted a message,externalwarning people planning to form ""Christmas bubbles"" in the UK to start minimising contact with people from outside their households from today. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""nobody wants a third lockdown"" but England's tiered system was ""not strong enough"". He called for the prime minister to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households, instead of three, was a ""step in the right direction"". Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team's modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said he was ""more concerned"" about what the country was going to be facing in early January than over the Christmas period itself. The epidemiologist from Imperial College London told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that very rapid increases in case numbers had left ""very little headroom"", adding that any future lockdown in England may have to be tougher than the one seen in November. Meanwhile,teaching unions have criticised the government's announcement that the return to secondary school in January will be staggeredto allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme. They say the move came too late for them to make the necessary preparations for testing. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has defended the plan, saying the government would provide support. It comes aftera tough new six-week lockdown was announced in Northern Irelandfrom 26 December. Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures were essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, with non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hair salons having to close. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the restrictions, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops, including supermarkets, having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. In Wales,non-essential shops will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. In England, some 38 million people will be subject to the nation's strictest measures - tier three - from Saturday. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the option for a post-Christmas lockdown in Scotland ""remains on the table"". Meanwhile, documents released by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period - of a week or more - would reduce the risk even further. A document dated 26 November says taking a rapid coronavirus test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce the risk. Sage says mixing between households over the festive period for one or two days would be less risky than multiple households spending the entire time together. But the documents warn there may be a higher proportion of cases in more vulnerable age groups during the festive period, which could lead to an increase in hospital admissions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concern that it will fuel a further surge in case numbers. Average NHS bed occupancy in England has reached almost 89% for the week ending 13 December, with 59 out of 126 NHS trusts reporting bed occupancy of higher than 90% - which is above the recommended safe level. Dr Katherine Henderson told BBC News the UK was at a ""really dangerous point where we could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage"" and her colleagues were ""increasingly"" seeing ambulances queuing outside hospitals. In Northern Ireland, Dr Martin Kelly, a consultant respiratory physician in Londonderry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Right in the mouth of Christmas we're seeing a significant further surge in numbers which is already putting the service under significant pressure."" And Dr Nick Lyons, a health board medical director in south Wales, said things were similar in his region, where non-urgent procedures have been cancelled. The intensive care units ""were basically full with Covid patients"" while the area's field hospital was ""roughly at half its total capacity"", he told Today.

Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

"The UK's R - or reproduction - number is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the coronavirus epidemic is growing once again. Covid-19 cases have risen to an estimated 660,000 infections across the UK between 6-12 December. In England, the rise was driven by sharp increases in London, plus rises in the South East and East Midlands. But the proportion of people testing positive in the North West and Yorkshire has continued to fall. Roughly one in every 95 people had the virus across Britain last week. The previous week's figures suggested about 560,000 people had the virus across the UK - one in 115 people in England, one in 120 in Scotland, one in 175 in Wales and one in 235 in Northern Ireland. So weekly cases have gone up by about a fifth. Covid cases are broadly stable in Northern Ireland with about one in every 215 people testing positive, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. The R number tells you how fast the epidemic is growing or shrinking. Anything above one - indicating that each infection leads to more than one extra infection - means the epidemic is growing. What is the R number and how is it calculated? Prof Neil Ferguson, the influential epidemiologist from Imperial College London, told Radio 4's the World at One any future lockdown may have to be tougher than the one seen in England in November. He said he was ""more concerned about what we're going to be facing in early January than I am over the Christmas period itself. ""We're facing very rapid increases in case numbers over time and we have very little headroom - we've heard reports today that local hospitals that really are at their limits at the moment - as is typically the case in winter. So we just won't be able to allow case numbers to rise much further."" In England, there were increases in people testing positive in all age groups apart from 17-24-year-olds and 50-69-year-olds. The figures suggest infections maybe levelling off in teenagers and young adults. The highest proportions of Covid cases are now found in London and the East Midlands, followed by the North East and North West of England. Across the UK, restrictions are about to be loosened over the Christmas period. Prof Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said this policy, ""increasingly looks like the wrong decision at the wrong time. ""By allowing travel around the UK and changing guidance to allow household mixing indoors we are setting ourselves up for a miserable January with tough restrictions."" Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced new lockdowns to come into force immediately after this period of relaxation. Similar arrangements for England and Scotland have not been announced, but they also haven't been ruled out. What is happening to the UK's R number?

"Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges from January School staff feel ""broken"" by last minute demands for them to run testing schemes in secondary schools in England, a head teacher has said. Nicola Mason, a Staffordshire school head, said she was staggered to hear, as the term ends, that heads have to set up testing for pupils next term. It meant staff would be working through Christmas to get ready for January. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the idea was to get pupils back safely when they returned to school. A joint statement from teachers' unions and the National Governance Association, representing school governors, says schools should not feel under pressure to carry out the testing, if it is not a realistic possibility in the time available. The advice, also signed by the Association of Colleges and the Church of England education service, says the announcement of the programme has been ""chaotic and rushed"". It also says the plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges, and stresses that the Department for Education guidance refers to an ""offer"" of testing rather than a requirement for schools to test. Staggered return for England's secondary schools 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests General secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said the scheme was ""undeliverable"" in the timescale set out. ""It is beyond belief that they were landed on school and college leaders in such a cack-handed manner,"" he said. ""It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests, and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period."" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government was ""in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory once again"". The plan involves using the first week of term to test pupils as they return gradually to classrooms in a staggered way. Those in exam years, Years 11 and 13, would return first for face-to-face teaching, while the rest would be taught online. Ms Mason, head teacher at Chase Terrace Academy in Burntwood, said: ""The government at the very last minute again have literally broken the teachers."" This video can not be played Head teacher Simon Uttley: ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality I'm afraid feels a bit more like Dad's Army."" She said local public health teams already had plans in place to phase tests in next term which were now not valid. ""Leaders are confused at best,"" she said. ""The guidance is way too late to plan effectively, there are still a number of things we don't know. ""We found out through BBC News, we weren't even told directly that this was being put into place. Frankly I am staggered."" Another head teacher, Simon Uttley, of Blessed Hugh Faringdon School in Reading, said he also first heard of government plans from the BBC News app. ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality, I'm afraid, feels a bit more like Dad's Army,"" he said. But the prime minister told reporters that in terms of ""social justice"" it was important to make sure as many children as possible were in school. ""Everybody in the country agrees this is a massive priority. If you listen to the Chief Medical Officer, for the health and well-being of young people, they have to receive their education,"" said Mr Johnson. Head teacher Ms Mason said already exhausted staff now had to use the Christmas holidays to plan for remote lessons, recruit volunteers, do safe-guarding checks, and organise the logistics of the testing and gain consent from parents. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Parent of two Ian Ahern from Sandymoor, Cheshire, said: ""What ridiculous timing! ""My two children are in Year 11 and 8. They have just finished for Christmas. ""My wife is a teacher and finishes school today. How are parents, teachers and staff supposed to organise this?"" He added that as a school governor, he knew how hard schools have been working to organise for the next term. Another parent, from Altrincham, Mark Simpson, said: ""It's ridiculously last minute to announce something like this on what for many schools in England is the last day of term, it seems nonsensical."" The late notice for the plan to test ""millions of pupils"" meant it was not going to work, he said. Mr Gibb defended the plans, saying fuller guidance would be published next week filling in any gaps. He said: ""This is a fast-moving pandemic, we have to take action at pace. ""We do have to take swift action, we've been testing these tests in schools over the last several weeks."" This video can not be played Schools minister Nick Gibb sets out Covid-19  testing plans for secondary schools He said the programme would be a national effort supported by the Ministry of Defence and that schools would have the costs of agency staff covered - but it was not clear whether these staff would be health professionals or supply teachers. ""It is very important that we are testing 5.5 million students twice, three days apart, to make sure we are breaking the transmission of the virus after the increased mixing over the Christmas holidays,"" he said. ""It's all about making sure we have more young people in the classroom over the spring and summer term as we go forward, and this is an amazing initiative to get these tests into schools."" The Department for Education guidance says schools would have to provide one to two members of staff and several volunteers (for example governors) to organise and run the testing. Agency staff may be used and schools would be reimbursed, but it is not clear if this means teaching staff or health care professionals. And armed forces personnel are to support the scheme directly by planning with schools and colleges.

Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain.

TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

"Boris Johnson says he hopes to avoid a third lockdown in England but warns infection rates have risen ""very much"" in recent weeks Northern Ireland has announced a new six-week coronavirus lockdown from 26 December Wales has already announced a three-week lockdown from 28 December and Scotland is considering tighter restrictions Ministers have defended plans for many pupils in England and Wales to have a staggered return post-Christmas Teachers say the announcement - designed to allow schools to set up Covid testing schemes - came too late A second vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts The head of the FDA said it would move ""rapidly"" to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing millions of doses to be shipped Globally there have been 75 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1.66 million deaths with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University If you are just joining us here are some of the headlines from across the UK today. That's all from our live coronavirus coverage for today. It has been edited by Chris Clayton and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and written by Francesca Gillett, David Walker, Paul Kirby and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"".

""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure.

"The UK's R - or reproduction - number is now estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, meaning the coronavirus epidemic is growing once again. Covid-19 cases have risen to an estimated 660,000 infections across the UK between 6-12 December. In England, the rise was driven by sharp increases in London, plus rises in the South East and East Midlands. But the proportion of people testing positive in the North West and Yorkshire has continued to fall. Roughly one in every 95 people had the virus across Britain last week. The previous week's figures suggested about 560,000 people had the virus across the UK - one in 115 people in England, one in 120 in Scotland, one in 175 in Wales and one in 235 in Northern Ireland. So weekly cases have gone up by about a fifth. Covid cases are broadly stable in Northern Ireland with about one in every 215 people testing positive, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates. The R number tells you how fast the epidemic is growing or shrinking. Anything above one - indicating that each infection leads to more than one extra infection - means the epidemic is growing. What is the R number and how is it calculated? Prof Neil Ferguson, the influential epidemiologist from Imperial College London, told Radio 4's the World at One any future lockdown may have to be tougher than the one seen in England in November. He said he was ""more concerned about what we're going to be facing in early January than I am over the Christmas period itself. ""We're facing very rapid increases in case numbers over time and we have very little headroom - we've heard reports today that local hospitals that really are at their limits at the moment - as is typically the case in winter. So we just won't be able to allow case numbers to rise much further."" In England, there were increases in people testing positive in all age groups apart from 17-24-year-olds and 50-69-year-olds. The figures suggest infections maybe levelling off in teenagers and young adults. The highest proportions of Covid cases are now found in London and the East Midlands, followed by the North East and North West of England. Across the UK, restrictions are about to be loosened over the Christmas period. Prof Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said this policy, ""increasingly looks like the wrong decision at the wrong time. ""By allowing travel around the UK and changing guidance to allow household mixing indoors we are setting ourselves up for a miserable January with tough restrictions."" Wales and Northern Ireland have already announced new lockdowns to come into force immediately after this period of relaxation. Similar arrangements for England and Scotland have not been announced, but they also haven't been ruled out. What is happening to the UK's R number?

"Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges from January School staff feel ""broken"" by last minute demands for them to run testing schemes in secondary schools in England, a head teacher has said. Nicola Mason, a Staffordshire school head, said she was staggered to hear, as the term ends, that heads have to set up testing for pupils next term. It meant staff would be working through Christmas to get ready for January. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the idea was to get pupils back safely when they returned to school. A joint statement from teachers' unions and the National Governance Association, representing school governors, says schools should not feel under pressure to carry out the testing, if it is not a realistic possibility in the time available. The advice, also signed by the Association of Colleges and the Church of England education service, says the announcement of the programme has been ""chaotic and rushed"". It also says the plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges, and stresses that the Department for Education guidance refers to an ""offer"" of testing rather than a requirement for schools to test. Staggered return for England's secondary schools 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests General secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said the scheme was ""undeliverable"" in the timescale set out. ""It is beyond belief that they were landed on school and college leaders in such a cack-handed manner,"" he said. ""It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests, and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period."" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government was ""in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory once again"". The plan involves using the first week of term to test pupils as they return gradually to classrooms in a staggered way. Those in exam years, Years 11 and 13, would return first for face-to-face teaching, while the rest would be taught online. Ms Mason, head teacher at Chase Terrace Academy in Burntwood, said: ""The government at the very last minute again have literally broken the teachers."" This video can not be played Head teacher Simon Uttley: ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality I'm afraid feels a bit more like Dad's Army."" She said local public health teams already had plans in place to phase tests in next term which were now not valid. ""Leaders are confused at best,"" she said. ""The guidance is way too late to plan effectively, there are still a number of things we don't know. ""We found out through BBC News, we weren't even told directly that this was being put into place. Frankly I am staggered."" Another head teacher, Simon Uttley, of Blessed Hugh Faringdon School in Reading, said he also first heard of government plans from the BBC News app. ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality, I'm afraid, feels a bit more like Dad's Army,"" he said. But the prime minister told reporters that in terms of ""social justice"" it was important to make sure as many children as possible were in school. ""Everybody in the country agrees this is a massive priority. If you listen to the Chief Medical Officer, for the health and well-being of young people, they have to receive their education,"" said Mr Johnson. Head teacher Ms Mason said already exhausted staff now had to use the Christmas holidays to plan for remote lessons, recruit volunteers, do safe-guarding checks, and organise the logistics of the testing and gain consent from parents. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Parent of two Ian Ahern from Sandymoor, Cheshire, said: ""What ridiculous timing! ""My two children are in Year 11 and 8. They have just finished for Christmas. ""My wife is a teacher and finishes school today. How are parents, teachers and staff supposed to organise this?"" He added that as a school governor, he knew how hard schools have been working to organise for the next term. Another parent, from Altrincham, Mark Simpson, said: ""It's ridiculously last minute to announce something like this on what for many schools in England is the last day of term, it seems nonsensical."" The late notice for the plan to test ""millions of pupils"" meant it was not going to work, he said. Mr Gibb defended the plans, saying fuller guidance would be published next week filling in any gaps. He said: ""This is a fast-moving pandemic, we have to take action at pace. ""We do have to take swift action, we've been testing these tests in schools over the last several weeks."" This video can not be played Schools minister Nick Gibb sets out Covid-19  testing plans for secondary schools He said the programme would be a national effort supported by the Ministry of Defence and that schools would have the costs of agency staff covered - but it was not clear whether these staff would be health professionals or supply teachers. ""It is very important that we are testing 5.5 million students twice, three days apart, to make sure we are breaking the transmission of the virus after the increased mixing over the Christmas holidays,"" he said. ""It's all about making sure we have more young people in the classroom over the spring and summer term as we go forward, and this is an amazing initiative to get these tests into schools."" The Department for Education guidance says schools would have to provide one to two members of staff and several volunteers (for example governors) to organise and run the testing. Agency staff may be used and schools would be reimbursed, but it is not clear if this means teaching staff or health care professionals. And armed forces personnel are to support the scheme directly by planning with schools and colleges.

"Vehicles are stranded on the snow-covered Kanetsu expressway Rescuers are trying to free more than 1,000 vehicles which have been stranded on a highway for two days after a heavy snow storm struck Japan. Authorities have distributed food, fuel and blankets to the drivers on the Kanetsu expressway, which connects the capital Tokyo to Niigata, in the north. The snow, which began on Wednesday evening, has caused multiple traffic jams along the road. It has also left more than 10,000 homes in the north and west without power. A Kyodo News report said that there were multiple reports of congestion at different points of the Kanetsu expressway. The gridlock began when a trailer got stuck in snow on Wednesday night. Another Kyodo report, quoting police and highway operator East Nippon Expressway Co, said the traffic jam had stretched up to 16.5km (10 miles) along the road at one point. Officials have been using a combination of heavy machinery and physical labour to dig out the vehicles one by one, but around 1,000 cars were still stranded on the road as of Friday noon. ""We are trying our best to rescue drivers and passengers, we are ready to continue the operation through the night,"" a Niigata disaster management official told AFP on Thursday night. Food, fuel and blankets were distributed to drivers Another similar traffic jam also occurred in the nearby Joshinetsu Expressway which saw 300 vehicles stranded. That gridlock lasted from Wednesday to Thursday morning. According to the meteorological agency, the heavy snow - said to be this year's most intense cold spell - is expected to continue through the weekend. The country's prime minister Yoshihide Suga has called an emergency cabinet meeting and urged the public to be cautious.

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

"The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil is seeing ""unprecedented"" demand The number of people in hospital with Covid is the highest since the pandemic began, with a top doctor saying it could get ""significantly worse"". There are 2,231 coronavirus patients in hospitals and Wales' lead respiratory doctor said hospital pressures were ""much worse than the first wave"". It comes as Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said Covid patients were occupying all its intensive care beds. Hywel Dda will delay routine care due to a record number of Covid inpatients. Intensive care units across Wales are treating the highest number of coronavirus patients since April. TheUK's seven most infected local authoritiesare all in Wales - Merthyr Tydfil tops the list with 1,128.9 cases per 100,000 people - while Bridgend, in second, has the highest Covid test positivity rate in the country with 28%. Cwm Taf Morgannwg, the health board that covers Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd and Bridgend, hassuspended some non-emergency servicesand is treating 500 coronavirus patients in an ""unprecedented demand"" on services. Cwm Taf pauses non-urgent services over Covid NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Behind the scenes on the coronavirus front line Now Hywel Dda, the health board that covers parts of west and mid Wales, will temporarily postpone routine appointments from Monday as it is ""treating the highest number of inpatients with confirmed Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic"". Two other south Wales health boards -Aneurin Bevanin the south-east andSwansea Bay- have also suspended non-urgent care. Wales has the highest infection rate of the UK nations - 530.2 cases per 100,000 people over seven days - and Dr Simon Barry, the national respiratory lead doctor in Wales, has warned the pressure on Welsh hospitals will get worse. ""It is fair to say, and this belief is reflected by my colleagues in other parts of Wales, it is exceptionally busy and much worse than it was during the first wave,"" said Dr Barry. ""The hospitals are full - they are full of general medical patients. The difference with the first wave is that both streams are busy so we basically don't have capacity in the hospitals."" Almost 18,000 of Wales' 117,367 Covid cases have been reported by Public Health Wales in the past seven days and patients with the virus make up 28% of all patients in hospital. More than3,000 people have died in Wales with CovidandWales' R numberhas risen to between 0.9 and 1.2 - and Dr Barry believes that is reflected in the number of patients in hospital. While hospitals are filling up, Dr Barry said the impact of staff sickness and isolation was affecting the care that can be delivered, with a shortage of intensive care nurses a ""major issue"". The intensive care unit at Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend is also full of Covid patients ""On intensive care there are a lot of nurses who are sick or are shielding,"" said the consultant chest physician from Cardiff. ""You have to have one-to-two nursing, and they can't achieve that. Similarly, if you are managing patients on respiratory wards where you have got sick people, and it is essentially a high-dependency ward, we don't have enough nurses. ""That is reflected across every hospital in Wales. That is the major issue, it is about staffing."" Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board has seen a 28% rise in coronavirus patients over the past week and 42% of all its patients in hospital beds have the virus. The numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds in Wales set another record on Thursday - 2,231 across Wales - up 13% on the week before. Earlier, Cwm Taf's medical director Dr Nick Lyons said people's behaviour was going to make a bigger difference, especially around Christmas, than the new Welsh Government rules. ""When I see our hospitals under the pressure they're under, the difficulties that are going to be caused to the population we serve by the decisions made, then I think it's as much making that personal link between what our own actions make as we prepare for Christmas,"" he said. ""That's going to make the real difference and that's going to save lives.""

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

"Boris Johnson says he hopes to avoid a third lockdown in England but warns infection rates have risen ""very much"" in recent weeks Northern Ireland has announced a new six-week coronavirus lockdown from 26 December Wales has already announced a three-week lockdown from 28 December and Scotland is considering tighter restrictions Ministers have defended plans for many pupils in England and Wales to have a staggered return post-Christmas Teachers say the announcement - designed to allow schools to set up Covid testing schemes - came too late A second vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts The head of the FDA said it would move ""rapidly"" to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing millions of doses to be shipped Globally there have been 75 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1.66 million deaths with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University If you are just joining us here are some of the headlines from across the UK today. That's all from our live coronavirus coverage for today. It has been edited by Chris Clayton and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and written by Francesca Gillett, David Walker, Paul Kirby and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

The home had been free of the virus for nine months,CBS News reported,external, citing Sister Debra Marie Sciano, provincial leader for School Sisters of Notre Dame Central Pacific Province. However, one nun tested positive on Thanksgiving Day and - despite precautions - several more confirmed cases followed.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" There are ""just a few hours left"" for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Michel Barnier. Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the two sides to come to an agreement. He said there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, but the ""path is very narrow"". Boris Johnson said the UK side was willing to ""keep talking"", but added: ""Things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged."" Talks are resuming later between the two teams in Brussels after the prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Thursday night. Mrs von der Leyen said bridging ""big differences"", particularly on fishing rights, would be ""very challenging"", while Mr Johnson said a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Earlier, Mr Barnier met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the ongoing division over the issue. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""dithering over Brexit"", calling for the PM to ""get this deal done"" and ""deliver it for the British people"". Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but has been following the bloc's trade rules while the two sides negotiate a trade deal. If one is not agreed by 31 December, they will go on to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Mr Barnier said it was the UK that decided on the deadline and the EU would have been willing to extend the so-called transition period into next year so talks could continue. ""If they should leave with an agreement or without, it is nevertheless the Brits that decided on that deadline,"" he told the European Parliament. Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will ""prosper"" with or without a trade deal with the EU. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The talks taking place in Brussels between Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart, Lord David Frost, are aimed at breaking the deadlock on key issues that remain unresolved. They include rights to fishing waters from 1 January and what is known as the ""level playing field"" - where the EU does not want UK businesses to get an unfair advantage by moving away from its rules and standards. On fishing, Mr Barnier said if the UK wants to use its ""sovereignty"" over its waters to cut access for EU fisherman, ""then the European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or compensate adjusting conditions [to access the] single market"". And on the level playing field, he said there needed to be ""fair competition"" in place, adding: ""If the sovereign United Kingdom would like to depart from those standards, that is their right, but it brings with it consequences when it comes to access to our markets without tariffs or quotas."" Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking on a visit to Manchester, Mr Johnson said the UK position was ""always that we want to keep talking if there is any chance of a deal"". But he called for the EU to ""recognise the UK has got to be able to control its own laws - that's what people voted for - and we have also got to be able to control our waters and fishing rights"". The PM added: ""No sensible government is going to agree to a treaty that doesn't have those two basic things in it as well as everything else. ""Our door is open, we will keep talking, but I have to say that things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged. ""The UK has done a lot to try and help and we hope our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves."" Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and EU. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side, and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

"The number of people who have died with Covid in Wales has passed 3,000 according to Public Health Wales It has reported the deaths of 38 more people, taking the total to 3,011 There were 2,801 new cases of the virus reported Mental health minister Baroness Morgan is giving the Welsh Government's regular coronavirus briefing She urged people to ""behave sensibly"" over Christmas to avoid ""trouble"" in the new year There will be extra money to help businesses hit by new lockdown restrictions, she also announced Retail sales fell in November according to the Office for National Statistics, bringing to an end six months of rising trade Millions of people in England face tougher restrictions from Saturday, while a new lockdown begins on Boxing Day in Northern Ireland Richard Porter and Lola Mayor That's it from our live coverage this Friday. Here's a reminder of what's happened so far:  Remember, you can watch the press conference again by clicking on the video at the top of this page. Welsh minister Baroness Morgan has urged people to ""behave sensibly"" this Christmas to avoid further ""trouble"" in the new year. The number of households who can mix in Wales over Christmas has been cut from three to two (a person who lives alone can join too). But for people who are still undecided or planning to see loved-ones, here is a reminder of how to mix more safely. A study by Sage,,externalthe UK government's science advisory panel, found that if you double the number of people getting together, the odds of infection increase fourfold. And since the coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, passing around objects could post a risk - soSage recommends playing quiz-style games instead,external. For more guidance on everything from noise levels to the length of recommended time spent together,head here. This video can not be played Sir Paul McCartneyhas been speaking to the BBC this morning,timed with the release of his new solo album which he recorded during lockdown. The former Beatle said he would be having the Covid vaccine, adding: ""I'd like to encourage people to get it too."" At the age of 78, McCartney is in the over-75s category, so will be in the third group of people to get vaccinated. And McCartney added that he doesn't expect next year's Glastonbury Festival to go ahead. ""100,000 people closely packed together with flags and no masks, you know, talk about superspreader,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of Wales's oldest women, 108-year-old Mary Keir, is among some of the first care home residents to receive the new Covid vaccine. The retired nurse was among 37 residents of the Awel Twyi care home in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire to receive their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine yesterday. âI was really happy to have the vaccine. Weâve been waiting for it to be ready,"" she said. Ms Keir worked as a ward sister at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff, during and after the Second World War. This is her second experience of a pandemic - after she lived through theSpanish flu outbreakin 1918. âThank God for the people who have been able to get it for us. Weâre very lucky. I now feel much safer and happier.â  More details are needed about the Welsh Government's latest business support scheme, says Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones. She says it also needs to be more targeted at the right businesses rather than âfirst come first servedâ. Minister Eluned Morgan earlier announced an additional Â£110m of funding for businesses hit by the latest restrictions. Ms Jones said: âWhat businesses are telling us is that itâs really
important to get the right support to the right businesses. ""One thing
that weâve been asking for in particular is to acknowledge that for some
businesses, they just need to stay closed until March, and we want to be sure
that this new package that the government is bringing forward is going to
enable those businesses to hibernate. âWe know now that the furlough scheme will be available and
that will be a big help, but businesses still have their fixed costs, rents to
pay, maintenance and so on.â Meanwhile, the latest Office for National
Statistics infection survey estimates the proportion of those testing
positive is continuing to rise in Wales. It took throat and nose swab tests from more than 19,847 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From the results, it estimates 33,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 4 December,
7,800 more than the week before. This is one in 90 people, or 1.1%
of the population. The survey found a total of 160
positive tests, in 143 people from 119 households over six weeks. Similar surveys suggest cases
have increased in England, where one in 95 people are estimated to be infected, with a
sharp rise in London. Wales needs to start the post-Christmas lockdown âas one
nationâ with the same rules, Eluned Morgan says. A number of Conservative MPs have written to the Welsh
Government saying the measures are disproportionate given lower numbers of
cases in some areas of north Wales. Welsh ministers have conceded that some regional variations may be
possible in the future. But Lady Morgan told the briefing: âI do
think itâs absolutely right that we look at places like Anglesey and Conwy
where the virus levels are low, but for the time being we are absolutely
determined to make sure we go into these restrictions as one nation. ""It
may be later that we think about phasing coming out at different levels but
that depends on how the virus behaves in the next few weeks.â She said people were âall inter-dependent as a nationâ
with the virus likely to move between areas. People have to ""behave sensibly"" over Christmas to avoid a
âvery hard timeâ in January, Eluned Morgan has told today's government briefing. âItâs absolutely in the hands of the Welsh public,â the mental health minister said. âWe can put measures in place and restrictions in place, but if
people donât respect them, then we can expect trouble ahead.â ""If we see this continue as it is we could be in for a
very hard time in the new year, so I would really urge people to take great
caution this Christmas, to behave sensibly, to follow the rules and if you
donât have to mix with other people, then please donât.â Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Away from the press conference, we've also been hearing from Nick Lyons, medical director of the Cwm Taf
Morgannwg Health Board. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 intensive care units in the health board were ""basically full"". Dr Lyons said there were 500 Covid patients
across their three main hospitals. On Thursdaythe board suspended non-urgent services. ""Our ITUs [intensive care units] are basically full with Covid
patients. ""All but the most urgent outpatient clinics and all but the most
urgent cancer surgery and clinically urgent surgery weâve had to cease,"" he said. Read more here  The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil is one of the hospitals affected We've had the latest data on coronavirus case rates from Public Health Wales. This map shows how many people have the virus in each local council area, compared to the population. An additional Â£110m is being offered
to businesses affected by the latest lockdown rules, the Welsh Government has announced. The cash is on top of the Â£340m
already announced at the end of November. Under the new restrictionsall non-essential shops will close from the evening of Christmas Eve, and all
hospitality premises by 18:00 on Christmas Day. The money will pay grants to
hospitality and non-essential shops through the business rates
system. Tourism, leisure and supply chain
businesses will be eligible for the same support if turnover has fallen by 40%
or more. Eluned Morgan said around Â£20m had already been paid out, adding that the
scheme offered more generous payments than the one in England. Opposition parties have criticised the Welsh Government for not yet allocating hundreds of millions of pounds in additional funding from the UK government. The seven-day rolling Covid case rate remains highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 1,128.9 per 100,000 people. It is followed by Bridgend on 952.1, Blaenau Gwent on 863.1, Neath Port Talbot at 850.6 and Newport at 837.9. Thirty-eight more people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 3,011 according to Public Health Wales data. It also confirmed 2,801 new cases.  Mark Drakeford also toldNewscasthis own family were âdisappointedâ after heâd had to scale down his own Christmas plans. The law is being changed in Wales,limiting gatherings to two households(and another single person if they live alone). He asks Welsh people to show restraint in the coming days, saying the âvery cunning virusâ had accelerated through the country during the autumn and winter. But he warned that âsmall acts of selfishnessâ on an individual level were adding up to the problems seen in Wales. However, he said his family âabsolutely understand that if we're expecting this of other people then we have to live up to that ourselvesâ.  The first minister has predicted other parts of the UK
may need to follow Walesâs lead in introducing lockdown measures after
Christmas. Northern Ireland has already saida six-week lockdown will begin there on Boxing Day. Speaking to the BBCâsNewscastpodcast, Mark Drakeford said âas soon as you begin to lessen restrictions this virus finds a way to
begin circulating again.â Mr Drakeford defended the Welsh Governmentâs decision to take the
country out of a firebreak lockdown after 17 days, saying the short lockdown
âdid everything we had expected of it.â He said âif I was thinking about England I would be remembering what happened in March of last yearâ â saying âthe advice from Sage has always been that the earlier you act and the more sharply you act the better the impact will beâ. Hello

"Leading UK property websites are hosting rental listings that may unlawfully discriminate against people who claim benefits, a BBC investigation has found. The majority of adverts on SpareRoom and OpenRent say people on benefits will not be considered as tenants. ""It's very demoralising,"" said Emma, a single mother from London. ""Everyone deserves housing."" The rental platforms said they were working to address the issues. In July,a judge ruledthat blanket bans on renting properties to benefits claimants are unlawful and discriminatory, breaking the 2010 Equality Act on grounds of sex and disability. But the practice is still widespread on SpareRoom and OpenRent. More than 80% of 59,000 listings we analysed on these websites were not open to benefits claimants. Both platforms currently offer landlords a tick-box option to exclude people on benefits, although SpareRoom plans to remove the option. Other websites have policies to remove discriminatory wording from adverts. This includes language such as ""professionals only"", ""no housing benefit"" or ""no DSS"", a reference to the old Department of Social Security. Fewer than 1% of 335,000 listings we analysed on Zoopla and Rightmove contained such phrases. However, the BBC found thousands of listings on these websites that seemed open to benefits claimants, where the same property advertised on OpenRent did exclude them. OpenRent founder Adam Hyslop said: ""We know that access to suitable properties for benefit claimants is a real and painful problem, and we want to solve the root causes of these issues. ""We've raised these issues in Parliament and with industry lobby groups and are working hard to address the root causes - as well as trying to combat prejudice by educating OpenRent users. ""OpenRent does not ban any group of tenants, and in the past year we have let over 25,000 properties where applications from benefit claimants were explicitly welcomed by the landlord."" SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson said: ""After the July ruling we changed the way SpareRoom works, so landlords can only list rooms as unavailable to benefit claimants if their mortgage or insurance specifically forbid it. However, we've seen far more rooms still being listed as unavailable than the small number we expected. ""The reality is that there are almost no buy to let mortgages left with those clauses in them, so we're currently in the process of removing the option to list as unavailable to benefit claimants completely."" Emma lives in a privately rented one-bedroom flat with her son. ""I pay my rent on time every month,"" she said, ""I have references to prove that as well as a guarantor."" Despite this, she has been unable to find a larger flat for two years. ""I'm in receipt of benefits, so landlords won't take [me]."" she explained. ""They'll gaslight you, ignore you."" Her housing situation has taken a toll on her mental health and stress levels. ""It's made me quite angry,"" she said. ""It's very traumatising."" Emma said landlords should not assume that benefit claimants will be unreliable tenants. ""In this economy, my benefits are more stable than your job,"" she added. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of households in Great Britain in receipt of the Housing Entitlement of Universal Credit grew 62% to 1.2 million, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. A further 746,314 private renters claim Housing Benefit. Recent housing statistics gathered from official sources by Shelter show women and disabled people are disproportionally affected by policies that ban benefits claimants. Disabled households are almost three times as likely to use Housing Benefit as non-disabled households. Women in the private rented sector are more than 1.5 times more likely to receive Housing Benefit than men. One man, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""DSS discrimination has been a constant hurdle in me even being able to secure a viewing."" The 49-year-old, who has learning disabilities and mental health problems, is in receipt of Housing Benefit, Employment and Support Allowance and Disability Living Allowance. ""As soon as I tell the letting agents that I'm not able to work as I'm disabled, either I don't hear back from them at all or I phone them up and they tell me the person I need to speak to isn't available,"" he said. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said:  ""Property portals should be reminding landlords and letting agents of their duty not to discriminate - they should not be contributing to the problem."" Otherwise, she said, landlords and agents risk serious legal action. She said insurance policies covering landlords who rented to housing benefit tenants were easily available and that all major lenders had removed their ""no DSS"" clauses, including from historic contracts. A survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of Shelter suggests that landlords' main reasons for not letting to benefits claimants include ""I do not want to let to this type of person or household"" and ""my letting agent advised against it"". Zoopla said: ""While we are happy that the BBC's research showed over 99% of our listings are compliant we recognise even one listing with discriminatory wording is too much. We are constantly updating our systems to ensure any attempts by agents to circumvent our rules are caught and, while we have made strong progress on this, the process is ongoing. ""Any agent we do find attempting to breach our rules on this can face a variety of sanctions including the removal of their ability to list properties on our site."" A Rightmove spokesperson said ""We believe that all prospective tenants should have equal access to the widest possible selection of properties possible irrespective of how their rent is paid."" We analysed over 300,000 rental listings across Great Britain that were advertised between the 1st and 15th of December. On OpenRent and SpareRoom, discriminatory listings were identified by a tick box option that excludes people on benefits from renting a property. On Zoopla and Rightmove, we searched for language such as ""no housing benefits"" and ""No DSS"", using a list obtained from Shelter.

"Andy Burnham oversees policing in Greater Manchester Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham should resign after the region's police force was placed in special measures, an MP has said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was placed into an""advanced phase"" of monitoringon Thursday after it failed to record 80,000 crimes in a year. Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green said Mr Burnham, who oversees policing in the area, should step down. The Labour mayor said he would not be stepping down. On Friday, GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkinsannounced his resignationwith immediate effect. He previously announced he would begoing on sick leaveafter suffering from labyrinthitis - an inner-ear infection which affects your balance - since the end of October. Asked why it was the chief constable who had stepped down and not him, Mr Burnham said: ""Because I do not run Greater Manchester Police. ""The police service is operationally independent from politicians and rightly so. My job is different. I have to hold the police to account for the services they provide to the Greater Manchester public, and I am here today doing my job holding the police service to account."" Inspectors said Greater Manchester Police's service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"" In a report last week, inspectors said GMP's service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services saidabout 220 crimes a day went unrecordedin the year up to June 2020. Inspectors found officers prematurely closed some cases without a full investigation, while the force did not properly record evidence that victims supported the decisions, particularly in cases of domestic abuse. A spokesman for the inspectorate confirmed GMP had been placed in the ""engage"" stage of its monitoring process. This means the force, the second largest in England, must ""develop an improvement plan to address the specific causes of concern"". As part of his role, Mr Burnham has responsibilities around the governance and budgets relating to GMP, supported by Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor for policing and crime. Earlier, Mr Green said Mr Burnham should ""resign now"" as he has ""absolute responsibility for policing, its failures"". ""His role ultimately is to ensure that GMP is delivering. He is in a position if he doesn't think GMP is performing and is delivering then he can challenge and if necessary he can sack the chief of police,"" he said. ""That is Andy Burnham's power over policing in Manchester. He has absolute authority."" Following the publication of the report earlier in the week, Mr Burnham apologised on behalf of GMP. ""I would like to say sorry to all of the victims of crime who have found that the service has not been good enough. We owe it to them to improve and we will and we will do it fast,"" he said. Former GMP detective Maggie Oliver said victims were being ""fobbed off and failed"" Former GMP detective Maggie Oliver, whoresigned over the way grooming cases in Rochdale were handledby the force, said she and two ex-colleagues had a meeting with Mr Burnham in 2018 to highlight ""serious concerns"" and were ""treated with contempt"". She said they gave him 26 examples of victims being failed by GMP, including ""people dying as a result of gross neglect"" and he ""basically slammed the door in our face"". There was a ""culture of arrogance and cover-ups"" at the force, she said, and a ""radical overhaul"" was needed. Ms Oliver said victim's ""trust in the police had gone"" and her charity, the Maggie Oliver Foundation, was ""drowning in cries for help"" from people who ""have nowhere else to turn"". Greater Manchester's chief constable Ian Hopkins had been due to retire in Autumn 2021 Sir Richard Leese, Manchester City Council leader, said the watchdog's findings indicate there are ""major issues"" that need to be addressed. ""I think it kind of says it all that GMP so far have not put up a spokesperson to explain what the situation is, what's been going on,"" he added. In a statement released on Wednesday, the mayor and deputy mayor said they were ""putting in place the necessary actions to improve standards of service to victims of crime in Greater Manchester"". Mr Burnham announced that a dedicated hotline for victims who have any complaints was also being set up. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Alex Webb said he hoped ""to achieve my big dream of owning my own restaurant"" A young chef ""came of age"" as he was crowned the winner of this year's Masterchef: The Professionals. Alex Webb won the final of the BBC One TV show after impressing judges Marcus Wareing, Monica Galetti and Gregg Wallace with his three-course meal. The 25-year-old said: ""It is the best feeling I have ever had in my life."" Mr Webb, who was born and lives in Essex, is the head chef of a restaurant in Dunmow he started working in as a pot washer when he was 15. ""To walk away with the trophy is incredible. I am so proud,"" he said. ""I really wanted it and all the blood, sweat and tears and sleepless nights have paid off."" For his winning meal, Mr Webb made a scallop ceviche starter with an artichoke and pickled pear tartare with yoghurt foam, parsley powder and capers. For his main course he cooked pan-seared trout with a number of parsnip sides, plus a mussel and caviar cream sauce alongside a mini potato fish pie. For dessert he served a white chocolate passion fruit dome.

"Lateral flow testing will be rolled out in secondary schools and colleges from January School staff feel ""broken"" by last minute demands for them to run testing schemes in secondary schools in England, a head teacher has said. Nicola Mason, a Staffordshire school head, said she was staggered to hear, as the term ends, that heads have to set up testing for pupils next term. It meant staff would be working through Christmas to get ready for January. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the idea was to get pupils back safely when they returned to school. A joint statement from teachers' unions and the National Governance Association, representing school governors, says schools should not feel under pressure to carry out the testing, if it is not a realistic possibility in the time available. The advice, also signed by the Association of Colleges and the Church of England education service, says the announcement of the programme has been ""chaotic and rushed"". It also says the plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges, and stresses that the Department for Education guidance refers to an ""offer"" of testing rather than a requirement for schools to test. Staggered return for England's secondary schools 'Huge expansion' of secondary school Covid tests Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests General secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said the scheme was ""undeliverable"" in the timescale set out. ""It is beyond belief that they were landed on school and college leaders in such a cack-handed manner,"" he said. ""It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests, and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period."" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the government was ""in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory once again"". The plan involves using the first week of term to test pupils as they return gradually to classrooms in a staggered way. Those in exam years, Years 11 and 13, would return first for face-to-face teaching, while the rest would be taught online. Ms Mason, head teacher at Chase Terrace Academy in Burntwood, said: ""The government at the very last minute again have literally broken the teachers."" This video can not be played Head teacher Simon Uttley: ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality I'm afraid feels a bit more like Dad's Army."" She said local public health teams already had plans in place to phase tests in next term which were now not valid. ""Leaders are confused at best,"" she said. ""The guidance is way too late to plan effectively, there are still a number of things we don't know. ""We found out through BBC News, we weren't even told directly that this was being put into place. Frankly I am staggered."" Another head teacher, Simon Uttley, of Blessed Hugh Faringdon School in Reading, said he also first heard of government plans from the BBC News app. ""The rhetoric is very much Battle of Britain, the reality, I'm afraid, feels a bit more like Dad's Army,"" he said. But the prime minister told reporters that in terms of ""social justice"" it was important to make sure as many children as possible were in school. ""Everybody in the country agrees this is a massive priority. If you listen to the Chief Medical Officer, for the health and well-being of young people, they have to receive their education,"" said Mr Johnson. Head teacher Ms Mason said already exhausted staff now had to use the Christmas holidays to plan for remote lessons, recruit volunteers, do safe-guarding checks, and organise the logistics of the testing and gain consent from parents. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Parent of two Ian Ahern from Sandymoor, Cheshire, said: ""What ridiculous timing! ""My two children are in Year 11 and 8. They have just finished for Christmas. ""My wife is a teacher and finishes school today. How are parents, teachers and staff supposed to organise this?"" He added that as a school governor, he knew how hard schools have been working to organise for the next term. Another parent, from Altrincham, Mark Simpson, said: ""It's ridiculously last minute to announce something like this on what for many schools in England is the last day of term, it seems nonsensical."" The late notice for the plan to test ""millions of pupils"" meant it was not going to work, he said. Mr Gibb defended the plans, saying fuller guidance would be published next week filling in any gaps. He said: ""This is a fast-moving pandemic, we have to take action at pace. ""We do have to take swift action, we've been testing these tests in schools over the last several weeks."" This video can not be played Schools minister Nick Gibb sets out Covid-19  testing plans for secondary schools He said the programme would be a national effort supported by the Ministry of Defence and that schools would have the costs of agency staff covered - but it was not clear whether these staff would be health professionals or supply teachers. ""It is very important that we are testing 5.5 million students twice, three days apart, to make sure we are breaking the transmission of the virus after the increased mixing over the Christmas holidays,"" he said. ""It's all about making sure we have more young people in the classroom over the spring and summer term as we go forward, and this is an amazing initiative to get these tests into schools."" The Department for Education guidance says schools would have to provide one to two members of staff and several volunteers (for example governors) to organise and run the testing. Agency staff may be used and schools would be reimbursed, but it is not clear if this means teaching staff or health care professionals. And armed forces personnel are to support the scheme directly by planning with schools and colleges.

"Boris Johnson says he hopes to avoid a third lockdown in England but warns infection rates have risen ""very much"" in recent weeks Northern Ireland has announced a new six-week coronavirus lockdown from 26 December Wales has already announced a three-week lockdown from 28 December and Scotland is considering tighter restrictions Ministers have defended plans for many pupils in England and Wales to have a staggered return post-Christmas Teachers say the announcement - designed to allow schools to set up Covid testing schemes - came too late A second vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts The head of the FDA said it would move ""rapidly"" to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing millions of doses to be shipped Globally there have been 75 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1.66 million deaths with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University If you are just joining us here are some of the headlines from across the UK today. That's all from our live coronavirus coverage for today. It has been edited by Chris Clayton and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and written by Francesca Gillett, David Walker, Paul Kirby and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us. As we come close to ending today's live coverage, here is a roundup of the main stories from around the world. For many, the Christmas holidays usually begin with a nativity performed in front of proud, if slightly nervous parents, followed by a jolly, if slightly out of tune version of Silent Night. This year, many of our favourite traditions have been cancelled. But a lot of schools have refused to let the pandemic ruin the festive spirit. In Grasmere, Cumbria, one school moved the action off stage and on screen - filming an alternative nativity showing the story of Mary and Joseph set in the coronavirus pandemic. While Sedbergh Preparatory School, also in Cumbria, chose to record its nativity at different locations around the school to bring the story to life. At Southborough Primary School, in Bromley, south-east London, Covid-19 restrictions on singing indoors meant the school couldn't hold its annual Christmas carol concert at the local church but instead staff arranged for the children to perform using British Sign Language.

Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser has warned that without the planned six-week post-Christmas lockdown, the number ofdeaths and hospital admissions would have been ""severe"". The new measures will begin on Boxing Day, 26 December, with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" was allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there would be ""many deaths."" ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" he said. Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose? Our colleagues at BBC Future - helped by experts and readers - have put together a list of things that might go into one.

Not surprisingly, it includes items connected to the pandemic such as face masks and bicycles, which have gone up in popularity as people avoid public transport and look for good ways to exercise. Read the piece in full here, with beautiful illustrations by Emmanuel Lafont. The Prince of Wales has been photographed wearing a mask during a visit to Royal Mail's office in Cirencester. He was shown how to sort letters and Christmas cards by Mark Messer, who has been a postman for 34 years. ""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

Four of the nuns at Notre Dame of Elm Grove died on the same day. The home had been free of the virus for nine months,CBS News reported,external, citing Sister Debra Marie Sciano, provincial leader for School Sisters of Notre Dame Central Pacific Province. However, one nun tested positive on Thanksgiving Day and - despite precautions - several more confirmed cases followed. ""Even though they're older and most of the sisters that did go to God are in their late 80s, 90s... we didn't expect them to go so, so quickly. So it was just very difficult for us,"" Sciano said.

In a joint statement they say âunanswered questionsâ remain, including about what staff are expected to do and what costs will be covered. Advice is being issued to all the head teachers, teachers, schools and colleges by the coalition to say if a decision is taken that they are unable to set up a testing system, based on the current plans, they will have support.

"The FBI is among those investigating the hacking campaign The US energy department is the latest agency to confirm it has been breached in what is being described as the worst-ever hack on the US government. The department is responsible for managing US nuclear weapons, but said the arsenal's security had not been compromised. Tech giant Microsoft also said on Thursday that it had found malicious software in its systems. Many suspect the Russian government is responsible. It has denied any role. The US treasury and commerce departments are among the other targets of the sophisticated, months-long breach, which was first acknowledged by officials on Sunday. SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters More US government agencies hacked 'State-sponsored' hack hits US cyber-security firm Tech Tent: Hacking the heart of the US government Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend what is one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks. Joe Biden said America would impose ""substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks"" President Donald Trump is yet to comment on the cyber-attacks. Meanwhile, US President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make cyber-security a ""top priority"" of his administration. ""We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber-attacks in the first place,"" he said. ""We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in co-ordination with our allies and partners."" America's top cyber agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (Cisa), gave a stark warning on Thursday, saying that addressing the intrusion would be ""highly complex and challenging"". It said ""critical infrastructure"" had been damaged, federal agencies and private sector companies compromised, and that the damage posed a ""grave threat"". The hack began in at least March 2020, and those responsible had ""demonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft"", the Cisa said. The agency did not identify what information had been stolen or exposed. Addressing the attack on the energy department, spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes confirmed it was responding to a cyber-breach - but said ""the malware has been isolated to business networks only"". She said security functions at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees US nuclear weapons, had not been affected. The list of who was hacked is already long - and it is going to get longer. These are still early, and quite frantic, days in the investigation as government departments, companies and organisations race to see if they have a backdoor in their systems and what might have been stolen through it over a period of months. The scale is potentially huge, but the truth is no-one is quite sure of the impact yet. So far, this looks to have been classic espionage - the targeted theft of information. There is not much sign yet that the hackers were planning to disrupt systems or carry out real world damage, although that could still emerge. That also makes it trickier for the US to respond - after all, espionage is something it also carries out regularly. The problem is that in this case US defences were not good enough to spot and stop those responsible. ""There's a lot we don't yet know, but what we do know is a matter of great concern,"" Mr Biden has said. Hackers are known to have at least monitored data within a range of key US government departments including state, defence, homeland security, treasury and commerce, Reuters news agency reports. Cisa said the perpetrators managed to breach computer networks using network management software made by the Texas-based IT company SolarWinds. Up to 18,000 SolarWinds Orion customers downloaded updates containing malicious software installed by hackers. All US federal civilian agencies were told to remove SolarWinds from their servers earlier this week as a result. Cisa said it was investigating ""evidence of additional access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform"". Microsoft said it had identified more than 40 of its customers who were targeted in the cyber-attack, including government agencies, think tanks, non-governmental organisations and IT companies. About 80% of these were in the US, while others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Israel and the UAE. The company's president Brad Smith said the attack was ""remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact"". ""This is not 'espionage as usual,' even in the digital age,""he wrote in a blog post,external. ""Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world."" Neither Cisa or the FBI have publicly said who they believe to be behind the attacks, but private security companies and officials quoted in US media have pointed the finger at Russia. The Washington Post cast suspicion on a Russian hacking group called Cozy Bear or APT 29, which has ties to the country's spy agencies. Bears with keyboards: Russian hackers snoop on West The Post reported that the same Russian group hacked the State Department and White House email servers while Barack Obama was president. In a statement shared on social media on Monday,external, the Russian embassy in the US said it ""does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain"". ""Malicious activities in the information space contradict the principles of the Russian foreign policy, national interests and our understanding of interstate relations,"" the embassy said.

Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Even tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. A further 489 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK,according to the latest government figures,external. This takes the total by that measure to 66,541. A further 28,507 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health reported. If you were to create a time capsule of objects that captured life in 2020, what might you choose?

""It's very difficult, isn't it?"" said Prince Charles, as he decided which slot to place a piece of mail in. ""It's something that comes with a knack and know-how,"" replied the postie. It comes aspeople and businesses said they were worriedthat their Royal Mail deliveries might not arrive on time. With just a week until Christmas, couriers are dealing with an unprecedented volume of parcels. Some Royal Mail sorting offices and delivery depots have fallen behind, resulting in delays for customers. Royal Mail said the majority of its network was now running as usual for this time of year. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Swiss shops will have to close earlier under the new rules Switzerland will enter a ""lockdown light"" on Tuesday, during which all bars and restaurants will be closed for one month. Cinemas, theatres, and museums must close as well, though these were already closed in large parts of the country. The population is advised to stay at home and not to travel during the Christmas and new year period. Shops must close by 19:00. The ski slopes will stay open, but only if local authorities are satisfied with the safety measures, this is likely to include an assessment of whether local hospitals have capacity for possible ski injuries. This restaurant in Lausanne set up protective bubbles for its customers The new restrictions come as Switzerlandâs Covid-19 cases stagnate at about 5,000 a day, after reaching a peak of about 10,000 a day in November. Deaths are now averaging between 80 and 100 a day, and Swiss intensive care beds are said to be close to capacity. Locals applauded the royal couple (centre) Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled a monument in the capital Madrid to more than 60 healthcare workers who have died with Covid-19 in Spain. The sculpture by Jaume Plensa stands in the northern district of ChamartÃ­n. Health Minister Salvador Illa and top Madrid officials also attended the ceremony. TeleMadrid news reports that some locals booed and jeered the health minister. Spain is among the European countries hit hardest by the pandemic, with a death toll of 48,777, according to official data. In September, Amnesty International reported that more than 7,000 healthcare workers had died with Covid-19 worldwide. The biggest death tolls were in Mexico (1,320) and the US (1,077), the report said. Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist Tiffany Dover was among the first healthcare workers in Tennessee to receive the jab at CHI Memorial Hospital A clip of a nurse fainting minutes after receiving the
Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has gone viral in
online communities opposed to vaccinations. Tiffany Dover says she has a medical condition that can cause her to
faint, and doctors at the scene say the incident is unrelated to the
ingredients in the vaccine. She fainted 17 minutes after receiving the vaccine yesterday, while being interviewed by reporters,external. The hospital told the BBC âshe never lost consciousness and quickly recoveredâ. âI have a history of having an over-active vagal response, and
so with that if I have pain from anything, a hangnail or if I stub my toe, I
just pass out,âDover told local reporters afterwards,external. âThe fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition,â Jesse L Tucker, a critical care doctor at the hospital, said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), fainting after vaccinations is fairly common, and usually triggered by pain or anxiety.,externalPatients are advised to âsit in a chair or lay downâ after receiving a jab. Doctors in the UK are being told to offer coronavirus patients in hospital follow-up appointments six weeks later, to check if they have symptoms of ""long Covid"". The new guidance comes from health officials at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no single medical definition for long Covid - but symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, dizziness and mental health problems.(Read more about it here.) The new guidance from NICE recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later. And it says anyone who was not hospitalised, but is still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection, should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. There's more on this story here. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full ashospitals try to cope with the demands of the Covid pandemic in addition to normal winter pressures. Ambulances queuing to offload patients, staff sickness and a lack of beds mean hospitals are ""at a really dangerous point"", say emergency doctors. The percentage of NHS hospital beds which are occupied is increasing and has reached almost 89% in England for the week ending 13 December - the highest figure this year but lower than the same point in 2019. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC: ""We are at a really dangerous point which could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage."" She added that it would be difficult to keep other work going, with pressure ""so tight"" on intensive care beds. While many of us will be worrying about catching coronavirus over Christmas people have been warned to be especially careful to avoid a trip to hospital for ""avoidable non-Covid-related reasons"". Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to be ""incredibly careful"" to avoid seasonal hazards such as burns from fires sparked by candles or turkey-related injuries. ""Just don't make anything more risky than it needs to be,"" she said. With hospitals already facing rising numbers of patients with coronavirus, and trying to balance their non-Covid work with staff sickness and a lack of beds, Dr Henderson said people needed to try not to add to that pressure. She said: ""Watch that turkey-baster, be careful with your oven, don't set fire to your curtains with candles. ""All the things that are usual common sense, but just be aware that everything's got an extra Covid flavour, sprinkling of Covid."" This video can not be played Retired doctor Stewart Britten has said he will not have a coronavirus vaccine unless they are shared equally with other countries. âBritain is buying, like many rich countries, a lot more of the vaccine than our fair share and a lot more than we need. ""And that is going to leave very little vaccine over for low income countries, even if they could afford it,â he told BBC World News. Britten said he believed in vaccinations and did not want to persuade other people not to get the vaccine, but he felt he needed to take a stand on the matter. While an international programme, called Covax, has secured two billion vaccines doses to be distributed between lower-income countries, some organisations are warning there is not enough to go round. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has secured agreements for two billion doses of vaccine for its Covax initiative - a programme that aims to ensure fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide. ""The light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news conference. The doses secured are from developers AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Sanofi/GSK, although none have yet been authorised for use. In a statement, the initiative said all 190 economies that had signed up to Covax would ""have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 - contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries' readiness for delivery"". Earlier this week WHO officials warned that a $28bn (Â£21bn) shortfall in funding meant poor and low income countries could be left behind in a scramble to purchase vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also helped set up the initiative, said the Covax alliance was also in talks with Pfizer and BioNtech over their vaccine, which has been approved in the US and UK, as well as with Moderna, which expects to have its
vaccine approved in the US later.

"Taxes must increase or services be cut to compensate for the loss of fuel tax income thanks to the advent of electric cars, the Treasury has admitted. Officials have been long concerned about the future loss of more than Â£30bn in revenue from drivers. In anew review,externalthe Treasury has acknowledged the problem in a way that will spark a debate about how driving should be taxed in the future. One idea would be to charge motorists for every mile they drive. But the AA says such road pricing will be tough to sell politically. Instead, the motoring organisation is proposing a system of ""Road Miles"" in which motorists are allowed to drive free of charge for 3,000 miles (4,000 in rural areas) before they start paying. The Treasury review offers another striking conclusion from a government department traditionally worried about harm to the economy from cleaning up the UK's emissions. Electric cars: Your questions answered Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 The latest message is the opposite - that tackling climate change might even benefit the economy by giving the UK a lead in clean technologies. It says: ""Overall, in the context of the rest of the world decarbonising, the net impact of the transition on growth to 2050 is likely to be small compared to total growth over that period. ""It could be slightly positive or slightly negative."" The document continues: ""Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. Without global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the climate will change catastrophically with almost unimaginable consequences for societies across the world."" Environmentalists welcome what they say is a dramatic change in tone from the Treasury, Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""Finally the Treasury has admitted that tackling climate change could actually be good for the economy. ""For years it's been a total drag on climate policies - it used to get in the way of any good proposals."" He said the Treasury should save money by scrapping the Â£27bn roads programme and the Â£100bn HS2 rail line - both of which will increase carbon emissions. This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? Nick Mabey from the think tank e3g told BBC News the document raised false fears that the UK would lose industries to nations with dirty economies if the UK decarbonised. He said: ""This report shows the Treasury still has a lot of homework to do to understand the full implications of the clean energy revolution for Britain. ""The report talks about the opportunities of moving to net zero but still underplays the benefits of cleaner air and healthier cities. ""[The Treasury has] still not grasped that British industry is not at risk from dirty imports but from industries powered by cheap solar power in Tunisia, the Gulf and Australia."" ""The obvious implication of this report is that the UK can afford to move faster to reduce climate risks."" But both men praised the Treasury for accepting that the big challenge for climate policy will be fairness, not technology. Its document - an interim review - said poorer people must be protected from the changes in employment and taxation, or the government would lose support for cleaning up emissions. This message was strongly advocated by the Citizens Assembly,externaldevised to gauge the opinions of the public on climate policy.

"Mohsin (left) and Zuber Issa in Blackburn last year A company co-owned by the billionaire Issa brothers who are buying Asda was fined for ""appalling"" safety breaches, a BBC investigation has found. One worker lost a finger in a bubble wrap machine in 2012, and another lost four fingers in 2015, weeks after the brothers resigned as directors. Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd showed ""a total lack of care about the safety of its employees"", according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The brothers declined to comment. In 2014, the Lancashire packaging firm Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd was fined Â£50,000 at Preston Crown Court for an incident two years previously, when a worker got a hand trapped between rollers while trying to clean a bubble wrap machine. He suffered burns and crush injuries, requiring skin grafts, and lost the top half of his middle finger. Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire petrol station bosseswho have agreed a deal to buy Asda for Â£6.8bn, were co-owners and directors of the company at the time, according to filings at Companies House. The court was told of two previous hand injuries at the company, which had been warned as early as 2009 of the need to guard dangerous machine parts, according to a press release issued by the HSE. Mohsin and Zuber Issa have agreed a deal to buy Asda HSE principal inspector Mike Sebastian said after the hearing that ""the company had failed to take any action to improve safety, despite receiving numerous warnings and at least two other workers also suffering injuries"". The factory was in an ""appalling"" state when the HSE visited, he said. ""There appears to have been a complete absence of any attempt to organise or control health and safety."" Mohsin and Zuber Issa are still investors in Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd, though they resigned as directors in June 2015, leaving their lower-profile older brother Zakir as sole director. Representatives of Mohsin and Zuber Issa declined to comment on this story. Zakir Issa and Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd did not respond to requests for comment. Billionaire Issa brothers buy German petrol chain Billionaire brothers' Asda takeover deal probed Who are Asda's new owners the Issa brothers? Two months after Mohsin and Zuber Issa resigned, in August 2015, another worker lost four fingers while cleaning a bubble wrap machine. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to this incident in 2017, paying a fine of Â£60,000. HSE inspector Steven Boyd said: ""These were life-changing injuries that could have been prevented. Sadly, in this case lessons from previous incidents had not been learned."" Preston Magistrates' Court heard that the machines were being cleaned while still running - a clear health and safety breach. The company was criticised for not reporting the incident until nine months after it happened, delaying the investigation and putting other employees at risk, according to the HSE. Zuber and Mohsin Issa have won awards for their entrepreneurship, and were made CBEs in October Europlast is a highly profitable firm, earning Â£2.7m on a turnover of Â£9.6m in the year to 30 March 2020. However, it doesn't feature in most accounts of the Issa brothers' meteoric rise. They started from a single filling station in Bury in 2001 to build a global petrol and convenience store empire stretching from the US to Australia with over 6,000 sites and â¬20bn (Â£18bn) of revenue, according to their company website. According to Companies House filings, however, they were already successful packaging entrepreneurs when they started Euro Garages (now called EG Group). Mohsin and Zakir Issa founded Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd in 1993 and Zuber Issa became a shareholder in 1998. The bubble wrap business helped to fund the growth of the fledgling forecourt empire. Accounts show that in 2002 Euro Garages received a Â£251,393 unsecured interest-free loan from Europlast, which continued to provide free credit in subsequent years. Their success with EG Group gave Mohsin and Zuber Issa the financial firepower to buy Asda from its previous owners, the US superstore group Walmart. In June 2015, the three brothers transferred their shares in Europlast to a Jersey holding company, now called EP Holdings. Mohsin and Zuber Issa each hold over a million preference shares in EP Holdings, which entitle them to a share of the company's profits, according to documents filed with the Jersey Financial Services Commission in September.

"NI's chief scientific adviser has said that without a six-week lockdown, the number of deaths and hospital admissions would be ""severe"". New measures will begin on 26 December with non-essential shops closing after Christmas Eve. Prof Ian Young said if an ""epidemic"" is allowed to proceed in ""an uncontrolled way"", then inevitably there will be ""many deaths."" Lockdown would allow hospital staff to cope, he said. ""While there will be huge pressures on the hospital system in January it should allow our colleagues to cope,"" Prof Young told BBC Radio Foyle. ""If you allow the epidemic to proceed in an uncontrolled way, you allow everybody if they choose to live their lives completely as normal with a dangerous virus in circulation, then inevitably there will be very severe consequences and many, many deaths."" Northern Ireland's new six-week Covid-19 lockdown is essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Hair salons and close-contact services will close. Pubs and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. Tighter measures will be in place for a week from 26 December with no gatherings allowed between 20:00 GMT and 06:00. Mr Swann said the ""short, sharp interventions"" introduced in October had not worked, so the executive was returning to the level of restrictions which helped curb infection rates earlier in the year. The reproduction rate - or rate at which the virus spreads - is currently 1 to 1.2, but there are fears it could rise to between 1.4 and 1.8 over Christmas. Business organisations have warned the new lockdown could""sound the death knell"" for many firms. On Friday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and there were a further 510 cases of the virus. It brings the Department of Health's death toll to 1,166. In the Republic of Ireland, six virus-related deaths were recorded, with 582 new cases also confirmed. The Christmas gathering arrangements - where households have chosen to form a Christmas bubble for a period of time between 23 to 27 December with provision for travel a day either side when absolutely necessary - will be allowed to proceed. But during the first week of the lockdown, people are urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. Between 20:00 and 06:00 from 26 December until 2 January: All businesses, including essential shops, must close No indoor or outdoor gatherings of any kind will be permitted, including at sporting venues Outdoor exercise will be permitted only with members of your own household. No household mixing will be permitted in private gardens or indoors in any setting, except for emergencies or the provision of health or care services No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level Mr Swann said the measures were being brought in ""with a heavy heart"" and there was no intention to extend these advanced restrictions beyond the first week, as he was mindful of the effect the last year has had on lives and livelihoods. But he added: ""A heavy responsibility will rest on all of us to remain at home as much as possible over the course of the six-week period."" The restrictions for this period include: Closure of hospitality and non-essential retail with a stricter demarcation between essential and non-essential retail than that deployed during the recent circuit breaker Click-and-collect retail will not be permitted, and homeware will not be categorised as essential retail Off sales (including from bars) will be permitted from 08:00 on Monday to Saturday, and from 10:00 on Sunday, until 20:00 on any day Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery food Closure of close-contact businesses Places of worship can remain open under strict conditions MoT centres are expected to stay open Clarification is to be given on where vehicles can be washed ahead of MoT Tradespeople are expected to be allowed into homes for essential maintenance Childcare bubbles will continue Formal shielding will not resume, but ""stronger advice"" will be issued Justice Minister Naomi Long has confirmed that jury trials and other court and tribunal proceedings will go ahead during the lockdown, within public health guidelines. Mr Swann said discussions were taking place between the health and education departments over what additional factors could be put in place in schools, amid speculation as to when schools can return after the Christmas holiday. About a third of Northern Ireland's care homes - and 10,000 of their residents - had now received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccinations, he added, describing the vaccine rollout as the ""start of fighting back"". We've had the ""softly, softly"" approach - now it appears the executive is going to use the stick. The decision arrived at by ministers was, we're told, unanimous and they could not ignore the scenes of ambulances queued outside hospitals this week and severe pressures on the system. The changes mean Boxing Day and new year's celebrations are going to be nothing like what we've ever had before - the initial measures in the first week of lockdown are an attempt to clamp down on house parties and suppress the virus. But there's no doubt this will be a hard sell in some respects - getting people to wilfully comply with what effectively amounts to a curfew will be not be easy. We're told visibility of the police will also increase that week, but there's been little detail about additional enforcement. Northern Ireland is ending 2020 on a sombre note and going into 2021 with a difficult task ahead - to try to get back to a place where an unpredictable virus can be brought under some sort of control.

When occupancy rises above 90%, he said, there was an increased risk of harm to patients. ""This is a wave on a wave... and the risk is we swamp our health service,"" he warned. Pre-arranged Christmas bubbles can still go ahead Dr McBride urged people to behave as they did in March, when the restrictions and behaviour saw the R number fall from almost 3, down to 0.7 by July. In its modelling, the Department of Health said it anticipated case numbers would continue to rise as Christmas approached.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" There are ""just a few hours left"" for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Michel Barnier. Speaking in the European Parliament on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the two sides to come to an agreement. He said there was still a ""chance"" of a deal, but the ""path is very narrow"". Boris Johnson said the UK side was willing to ""keep talking"", but added: ""Things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged."" Talks are resuming later between the two teams in Brussels after the prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Thursday night. Mrs von der Leyen said bridging ""big differences"", particularly on fishing rights, would be ""very challenging"", while Mr Johnson said a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Earlier, Mr Barnier met fishing ministers from EU states to discuss the ongoing division over the issue. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""dithering over Brexit"", calling for the PM to ""get this deal done"" and ""deliver it for the British people"". Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? The UK left the EU on 31 January, but has been following the bloc's trade rules while the two sides negotiate a trade deal. If one is not agreed by 31 December, they will go on to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which could see charges introduced on goods being sold and bought - and could lead to an increase in prices. Mr Barnier said it was the UK that decided on the deadline and the EU would have been willing to extend the so-called transition period into next year so talks could continue. ""If they should leave with an agreement or without, it is nevertheless the Brits that decided on that deadline,"" he told the European Parliament. Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will ""prosper"" with or without a trade deal with the EU. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our door is open"" for post-Brexit trade talks The talks taking place in Brussels between Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart, Lord David Frost, are aimed at breaking the deadlock on key issues that remain unresolved. They include rights to fishing waters from 1 January and what is known as the ""level playing field"" - where the EU does not want UK businesses to get an unfair advantage by moving away from its rules and standards. On fishing, Mr Barnier said if the UK wants to use its ""sovereignty"" over its waters to cut access for EU fisherman, ""then the European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or compensate adjusting conditions [to access the] single market"". And on the level playing field, he said there needed to be ""fair competition"" in place, adding: ""If the sovereign United Kingdom would like to depart from those standards, that is their right, but it brings with it consequences when it comes to access to our markets without tariffs or quotas."" Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Speaking on a visit to Manchester, Mr Johnson said the UK position was ""always that we want to keep talking if there is any chance of a deal"". But he called for the EU to ""recognise the UK has got to be able to control its own laws - that's what people voted for - and we have also got to be able to control our waters and fishing rights"". The PM added: ""No sensible government is going to agree to a treaty that doesn't have those two basic things in it as well as everything else. ""Our door is open, we will keep talking, but I have to say that things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged. ""The UK has done a lot to try and help and we hope our EU friends will see sense and come to the table with something themselves."" Why, you might ask, if the EU's priority in negotiations was to protect the single market, is Brussels allowing the issue of fish to endanger the whole deal? The level playing field is worth a lot more in monetary and political terms to the bloc, but it sounds quite abstract to voters. However, fishermen and women losing their jobs, industries dwindling... that would be very visible, very quickly, elevating the importance of fishing rights. It is in coastal countries where governments fear a public backlash if it's perceived they've sacrificed national fishing communities for a deal with UK. Although the majority of EU members are not coastal nations, and although everyone in the bloc would love to finally put this deal to bed - for political and financial reasons, as well as being plain fed up with the process - the EU as a whole won't try to force member states to sign up if they are unhappy. Michel Barnier spoke to EU coastal countries on Friday to try to find a compromise position but, because of the ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" mantra of negotiations, the EU mood is less optimistic about prospect of imminent breakthrough than it was two days ago. If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and EU. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side, and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script?

"Two weeks ago, millions of people watched Pastor Mick Fleming and Father Alex Frost on BBC News, feeding and clothing the poor in Burnley. Many were moved by their work, and since then they have received more than Â£250,000 in donations. But Mick's life wasn't always about love and care. He was once a dangerous, violent drug user and dealer, covering up painful childhood memories. Until a single moment changed everything. It was 10am, in a rough industrial area, far away from his home county of Lancashire. Mick Fleming, in his early 40s, was waiting outside a gym for someone to emerge. Mick was in a stolen car - a dark blue Vauxhall Cavalier - with the engine running. This was going to have to be quick. ""There was no sun, it was a dull dark day, I knew his routine, everything about him,"" he says. ""He was another drug dealer, just like me."" Mick was a well-established underworld fixer in the North West of England. He was the man others would ring to clear drug debts, and by the time he got the call it meant someone was heavily in debt to equally dangerous people. They were about to get hurt, and badly. ""My gun was in a plastic carrier bag, on the passenger seat, wrapped tight. You could see the shape of the gun, no DNA or prints would be left behind. Six bullets, spring loaded, it never fails."" He didn't have to wait long. ""I watched him walk out of the gym. But this time was different. He had two kids with him, two young children, blonde girls, around five years old. ""I got out of the car, and walked, my hand reaching into the plastic. But then I looked again at the children, again at their faces, their blonde hair, innocent kids. ""Then it happened."" Mick describes in detail seeing a blinding light coming from one of the children's hands. ""It was white, brilliant white. For 15 seconds I couldn't see,"" he says. ""It was like looking into the sun and I was paralysed by it."" Mick doesn't know what really happened to him that day, but one thing he is certain of - this was the moment that changed his life forever. ""I collapsed, then struggled back to the car. I felt sick, I was shaking, sweating, heart beating fast. I could hear my pulse as if it was in my head. I didn't know what was happening to me."" And then, he says, he pleaded with God to help him. But nothing happened. The only thing piercing the silence, he says, was Johnny Cash randomly playing on the radio. The song was Man in Black. ""I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,"" Cash sang. ""I felt like I was the Man in Black. By this point in my life, I had been arrested for attempted murder, kidnapping, firearms offences. I wanted to die, I'd had enough."" Mick took the gun, pressed it to his chin, still wrapped in plastic, and pulled the trigger. It didn't fire. ""I broke down, the tears would not stop falling, and I started to feel sick again. I was retching and I punched and smashed the car radio, my hand started to bleed. ""In that moment I was seeing myself for who I really was. I hadn't cried for nearly 30 years. The last time I cried like this was when I was 11 years old. Sitting in that car it was like I was crying for him, that child, the boy I was, and the life I could have had."" Mick was suffering a complete breakdown, his violent past catching up with him, the end of decades of pain. When Ed Thomas met Pastor Mick Watch:Poverty and the Pandemic: Burnley's Front Line Producer: Lou Martin Mick was born during England's 1966 World Cup-winning year into a Burnley working-class family. His Dad was a window cleaner, who had contracts to clean factories around the town, and, as Mick describes him, a ""proper Labour-supporting man"". ""It wasn't poverty, but it wasn't luxury. It was a strict upbringing. We were forced to go to Church, we couldn't step out of line, it was old-school discipline."" But everything changed over two days at the beginning of February 1977. On the first day of the month, Mick was attacked by a stranger in the park on the way to school. He was just 11 years old. ""I was in turmoil,"" he says. ""I'd been sexually abused, and I couldn't cope."" Mick realised he needed help, but first he had to tell his Mum and Dad. He walked out of his room where he had been crying, went downstairs, and looked his Mum straight in the eye. But what happened next was both cruel and extraordinary. ""Before I could open my mouth, the front door opened. It was my dad. He shouted, 'Your sister is dead.' It was brutal, just so direct. I remember the moment of pure silence, quickly pierced by the screams from my mother, howling like an animal."" Mick had been very close to his 20-year-old sister Ann. He says she looked out for him, gave him money, and bought him clothes. Ann, he later discovered, had had a heart attack and died in her father's arms at the doors to Burnley hospital. ""My dad was a tough man, but this must have been horrific for him. He watched the doctors and nurses trying desperately to resuscitate my sister."" Mick told me that this was the moment his childhood ended. A life disfigured in 48 hours. ""Drugs were my solution, and that was my introduction. The next 30 years were hell. Pure hell. I would use any drug, and always alcohol."" But with his dependency came criminality. At just 14 he was dealing drugs. People in Burnley, though, just thought he was self-employed, working out of town. The truth was very different. ""I was a drug runner and debt collector. I was good at my job. I'd hurt people. I wasn't bothered. I was arrested for murder twice, armed robbery three times, countless firearms offences. ""I was making crazy money, but there was nothing glamorous about this. I was lost, trying to keep my pain down, hide it. None of it worked."" In the 90s, there were two serious attempts on Mick's life, one a drive-by at traffic lights, the other a home invasion that went wrong. ""Criminality was my world. I didn't know how to work in a factory - I couldn't be normal. I'd see people going to work with sandwich boxes and I didn't want that. I wanted to stand out. ""Drugs were a constant around me - my best friend died from a drinking session aged 16. He choked on his own vomit, my other friend suffered a methadone overdose at 17. ""I became hardened to death. I always believed in God, but I also believed God didn't think too much of me."" Mick was also leading a double life - he had a wife and three children. But the years of lies took their toll. Mick's mum had to step in to take care of the children, to prevent social services getting involved. He says that during this ""horrendous"" time his home was often raided by police looking for drugs and guns. ""All this destroyed my mental health, too. I started taking more drugs. I was now a very dangerous man collecting debts, hurting people. I never expected to live long - genuinely I always believed I'd die young. I didn't want to live, I didn't know how to change."" It was 2009 when Mick found himself outside that gym with a gun wrapped in plastic. What happened in the car, the call to God for help, the attempt to take his own life, triggered an intervention by the authorities. ""Within 24 hours, I was sectioned under The Mental Health Act. My new home was Burnley psychiatric unit. I had nothing but the clothes I arrived in."" Strangely, Mick says, he felt at home in the unit. The patients made him feel loved and cared for. They gave him things - cigarettes, clothes, trainers. ""There were schizophrenic people in there who weren't treated, those who self-harmed, really ill people, the most vulnerable alcoholics. But these people were giving me essentials, because they saw I had nothing. I was overwhelmed."" It was here that Mick met Pastor Tony, who used to visit the unit. Together they prayed and talked, and Mick says he began to feel emotions again. He started helping others. It was the end of a troubled life, and the beginning of a new one of hope. A chance meeting with a tutor at the University of Manchester led to a degree in theology. It was tough at first - without much of an education Mick struggled to read and write, and was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia. He failed his first year, but with hard work and support from the university, he eventually achieved a 2:1 degree. ""I never drank or touched a drug again. It wasn't easy, it was horrendous. But it was my path to God - and all the way to 2020 and the pandemic. I had no idea of how much I'd be needed and how once again I'd be overwhelmed by suffering and pain."" Today you'll find the man now known as Pastor Mick, with the charity Church on the Street Ministries, in Burnley, with those most in need - the homeless, the drug users, the hungry. During the coronavirus pandemic he's never been needed more. I met him on a crisp, late November evening in an almost-empty car park in the centre of town. It was only 6pm but it was quiet - a silence we've become used to during lockdowns. Pastor Mick began to talk about the struggles he's witnessed this year. ""Politicians say that it's a leveller, this coronavirus. It's a lie, because if you're poor you've got no chance,"" he tells me. Across a dual carriageway, in the distance, they started to arrive. First the homeless, some carrying their belongings in bin bags. Then the users, from those on heroin to those dependent on alcohol. There were around 20 people here, from their 20s and upwards. Then more people came - some in cars, most on foot. At least 40 people were here now, of all ages. Many were desperate, huddling around two cars belonging to the volunteers, looking for warmth and food. ""There's no need to push - there's plenty,"" shouted Kaz, a friend of Pastor Mick's, and a volunteer. The boots of two cars opened and the waft of the hot food hits you first. It was hard not to notice the hands grabbing what they could, a slight push and a shove. Some were so in need, their freezing fingers burned as they touched the food, but it didn't stop them and not a single tray was dropped. It didn't take long for the hot food to be snapped up. There was more though - pre-prepared food bags for people to take home. At the back of the queue there was a gentle complaint. ""There's no chocolate in mine."" ""I think they've all got chocolate in brother,"" said Mick. ""Well mine hasn't."" ""I'm not Asda,"" Pastor Mick retorted with a smile. Most here were respectful and thankful, but there was also a sense of community. It's hard to believe this is happening in the UK today. Burnley is one of the most deprived local authority districts in England. What's more, the local council's spending power was reduced at a greater rate than the English average between 2010/11 and 2018/19. There's a young couple here who are struggling - she is in a wheelchair, he is her carer. They say they're having difficulties getting food and money to get by. ""A couple of day's food makes a massive difference to us,"" they tell me. Another car boot opened, this time it was full of clothes. It was now a more frantic scene as people searched through it. One woman in her 30s told me that she suffered from depression and the pandemic had made it worse. ""If it hadn't been for all these, I'd basically be dead."" Pastor Mick was approached by a man in tears. ""My foot is white, Pastor Mick, I'm in so much pain,"" he said. ""Don't worry brother, we'll get you sorted."" Mick guided the man in his 20s to two volunteer nurses, positioned away from the group for privacy. After 25 minutes, the initial rush had calmed. ""The need is absolutely colossal,"" said Mick. ""You've seen people who are working who can't make ends meet tonight. We've got volunteer NHS nurses for those who can't access primary care - some of these guys are sleeping on the concrete."" It was the day after the car park session, and Pastor Mick was in his white van, driving through the hilly mill town's stunning scenery, from the sandstone terraces to the prefab bungalows in the villages on the edge of Burnley. The van was packed with food, bread, biscuits, milk, chocolate. His phone never stopped. A 10-year old boy was asking for a freezer on behalf of his mum. Mick was on it. A single parent needed a bed for her child. Mick would sort it. He visited around 10 homes - and he does this every day, seven days a week. ""I go into houses and I sometimes have children ripping the bags open as I am carrying them through the door."" Pastor Mick's voice started to falter, the emotion was too much. ""And it's not alright that, and it wasn't as bad as that before the virus."" Not far from the centre of Burnley, Mick visited the imposing Gothic-style St Matthew's Anglican Church to see Father Alex Frost. They've worked together since the pandemic hit. The room next to the altar is now a makeshift food bank. ""The level of need here in Burnley at the moment, I think, is unprecedented,"" said Fr Alex. ""I think the people feel forgotten about. It is about money and numbers, and statistics. We can't rely on a food bank, it doesn't seem right, it doesn't seem modern day Britain. But it is."" Once Mick stocked up his van, he was back on the road. First up was Pete, his wife, and son. Debt has crippled them. An issue with the family's benefits meant payday loans and financial crisis. ""I had to take loans out, so we could eat and pay us bills,"" said Pete. ""We were in debt for well over a thousand pound. Thanks to Pastor Mick, we've got it down now to two, three hundred pounds. My son suffers from depression from it, and so does my wife."" Mick was off again. This time to see Viv. She's 55, lives alone and suffered terribly with her mental health during lockdown. ""I stopped eating for about a week, I just ended up collapsing on my bathroom floor and I were there for, I think, a full day,"" she tells me. ""Hyperthermia had kicked in with everything with me."" Viv had only recently got out of hospital, and was painfully thin. Mick had got some high-energy nutrition drinks to drop off. Living alone during this time has brought back painful memories for Viv - of previous family bereavements. ""It's like losing all my family again, it's just like brought it all back."" As Mick left, he promised to collect her painkillers prescription later in the day. ""She was trapped inside her house, imagine being trapped inside your own mind. She stopped living,"" he said. Next was a food parcel for Sheila, in her late 50s. Sheila had been diagnosed with stage-four cancer and was worried about the impact coronavirus had had on her care. ""I'm supposed to have blood tests done once a month for my cancer count,"" she said. ""But nobody's been and done it [in] six months. And I've just found out that what I thought was two hernias is not, it's one huge hernia. I can't be operated on, because my lungs won't survive it."" Sheila relies on her 21-year-old granddaughter. ""I don't want to be a drain on the system that's already dying, because I'm already dying, people need the NHS,"" she said. This was just a small insight into one day on Pastor Mick's journey in one town. Across England the death rate from all causes, between April and June this year in the most deprived areas of the country, was nearly double that of the least deprived areas. ""I've never seen anything like this, on this scale,'' said Pastor Mick, ""Poverty seems to be hidden, It's underneath the surface that people don't see, they think they do but they don't. Pastor Mick has travelled his own road to Damascus, from a life of crime to being tested everyday by the impact of coronavirus. I wanted to know what motivates him to keep going. ""What I do today, it's not a penance, it's the complete opposite. It's a privilege to serve the people of Burnley. It's a glorious thing,"" he said. But then Mick revealed a staggering story to try and explain why he is at peace with those terrible events of his childhood. Ten years ago, he befriended a homeless alcoholic outside a take away. Mick listened to him, cared for him, helped him to get sober and reunite with his family. The man died two years later but his family was thankful they'd all been together. ""What I never told him or his family, or the police, was that he was the man who raped me as a child. Why? I knew that I had been forgiven for my past. I didn't do what he had done, but still, terrible things, but I felt forgiven and I didn't want to live in his sin."" ""This is why I'm free, I'm not spending my life in torment. It's redemption."" We next found Pastor Mick praying with a woman outside St Matthew's. It was the second week in a row she had been here. She was distressed but finding comfort in Mick's words. Fr Alex explained what had happened. ""She came last Saturday and she broke down and told me her daughter had killed herself."" Afterwards, the woman, Sonia, explained the difference Pastor Mick and Fr Alex have made to her life. She said that without them she, too, would have taken her life. Inside St Matthew's, Fr Alex, broke down and sobbed. ""I'm sorry about getting upset. You carry people's burdens, you try to tell them it's alright. It's so upsetting."" Pastor Mick is proud that it is ""the people of faith who are stepping in and making a massive difference"". But Fr Alex wants others to find a longer-term answer to the issues exposed by the coronavirus in places like Burnley. The government says it is committed to reducing deprivation and has spent Â£100bn on welfare support this year. This is the story of Pastor Mick's journey, helping just some of those struggling in Burnley. But the fear is the challenges now facing our poorest communities will remain, long after this pandemic is over. Photographs: Phill Edwards Â© 2025 BBC.

"Food was one of the few sectors to see sales grow Store closures enforced by Covid curbs pushed down UK retail sales in November, figures have indicated. Sales fell by 3.8% last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, bringing to an end a six-month streak of rising trade. Clothing store sales saw a sharp fall from the previous month, the ONS said, while food stores and household goods stores were the only sectors that grew. Despite the monthly fall, overall sales remain above their pre-pandemic levels. ""After a run of strong growth, retail sales fell back in November as restrictions meant many stores had to close their doors again,"" said deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow. ""Clothing and fuel were particularly hit by the winter lockdown, with their sales falling sharply."" Mr Athow added that food sales, especially click-and-collect, were boosted as people were not able to eat out. Clothing and food prices fall in November lockdown Covid curbs scandalous, says Revolution Bars chief In another sign of the way the pandemic has changed shopping habits, online retailing accounted for 31.4% of the total, compared with 28.6% a year earlier. The ONS said feedback from businesses suggested that consumers had brought forward Christmas spending. ""In a month where England went back into lockdown and the UK as a whole was subject to tightening restrictions, it's little surprise that physical retail sales growth stalled in November,"" said Lynda Petherick, head of retail at Accenture UKI. Consumers had already brought forward Christmas spending, the ONS said ""However, the show must go on when it comes to Christmas shopping, and some retailers have triumphed by preparing their e-commerce operations for the boom in online sales. ""Black Friday and early festive shopping continued to stimulate a sector so desperately trying to build recovery momentum."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales will rebound in December, probably to a new record high, as people undertake their pre-Christmas shopping over a narrower time period than usual."" He pointed out that consumers had ""rushed back to the shops"" since non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen on 2 December. ""Retail sales, however, probably will struggle to improve on December's level next year, given that income support schemes will come to an end in April and people will rotate towards consuming more services again once they have been vaccinated. ""What's more, non-essential shops might well be forced to close again to contain a third wave of Covid-19 in January. The collapse of more traditional High Street retailers next year, therefore, seems inevitable."" Meanwhile, a separate survey by trade publication the Grocer has shed further light on how people's shopping habits have altered during the pandemic. The magazine's annual Top Products Survey, covering the 52 weeks to 5 September, found that supermarket purchases of alcohol had soared as people attempted to compensate for their inability to go to the pub during lockdown. Sales of lager were up more than a fifth on last year, adding more than Â£800m to the nation's grocery bill. Most-favoured brands included San Miguel, which saw sales growth of 63%, and perhaps surprisingly, the unfortunately named  Corona beer, up 40%. At the same time, sales of wine and spirits went up by Â£717m and Â£567m respectively. However, other products lost out. With people confined to their homes for much of the time, the UK bought 22% fewer cosmetics, while hairstyling products sagged by 18%. Sales of toothbrushes and deodorants both fell 10% for similar reasons.

"Free range chickens were found to have Avian flu at a farm in Orkney A flock of chickens from an Orkney farm has been culled in Scotland's first serious case of bird flu since 2016. A six-mile (10km) control zone has been set up on the island of Sanday. Thirty-nine free range laying chickens died of bird flu and the 11 remaining birds in the affected flock were put down. The controls include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure and restrictions on bird gatherings. Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said the risk to human health from the H5N8 Avian Influenza was very low. Bird keepers have been urged to comply with an order to house birds that came in to effect on 14 December. Bird flu killed wild birds in three cases in south west England All captive birds in Britain to be kept indoors amid outbreak Fareham and Ryde swan cases confirmed The last case of the H5N8 strain was found in a dead peregrine falcon in Dumfries and Galloway four years ago. Other less serious strains of have been detected since then. Ms Voas said: ""We have already made clear that all bird keepers - whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds - must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection. ""Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons or other birds of prey or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline."" She added that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs. In theory, this strain could transmit to humans but as yet there have been no cases of it anywhere in the world. However, it is highly infectious for birds and so restrictions for keepers have been put in place to lock their birds inside and away from wild birds. This is more serious than the last case in 2016 when just a single wild peregrine falcon was infected. Clearly this time there has been transmission of the virus. Free range poultry can continue to be labelled as such for a while but if this goes on for more than 12 weeks they will have to be relabelled and that will effectively devalue them. It's an additional headache producers could do without just now with everything else that's going on. But it is absolutely worth stressing that there's no risk at all from eating properly cooked poultry or eggs. Because of the number of cases in Europe and in England the risk of bird flu is currently judged to be very high for wild birds, high for poultry where there is poor biosecurity and medium for poultry with protection measures in place. A number of swans were recently found dead near theHampshire coast and on the Isle of Wightand there were culls inWarwickshire and Worcestershire. Earlier cases have included two farms inNorfolk, East Angliaand awildlife centrein Gloucestershire.  All 10,500 turkeys at afarm in North Yorkshirewere  culled following an outbreak. Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said Scottish cases were not ""unexpected"" given the cases in wild and captive birds elsewhere in the UK. ""We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds,"" she added. NFU Scotland animal health policy manager Penny Middleton described it as ""disappointing"". ""It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers, whether they have one hen in the back garden or a large poultry business, to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of Avian Influenza and keep out the disease"", she said. ""It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease - both in domestic birds and in wild birds - at the earliest opportunity.""

"An Openreach engineer working in a telephone exchange Openreach is creating 5,300 new jobs in its drive to speed up the UK's broadband networks. The government has told telecoms firms it wants ultra-fast broadband networks to reach every corner of the UK. To achieve this, BT's Openreach division is recruiting 2,500 people for engineering jobs and estimates its construction partners will take on 2,800 more. Openreach aims to connect 20 million homes and firms by the late 2020s. The Â£12bn project has been accelerated in part due to the pandemic. The government estimates that with a full-fibre optic broadband network available, nearly two million more people than previously estimated could choose to work from home in the long term, reducing transport and housing pressures in big cities and boosting local and rural economies across the country. Openreach: Fibre target at risk without government plan Where has all the broadband money gone? Virgin Media offers rural fibre broadband At the moment, Openreach is extending its full-fibre network to 40,000 homes and businesses a week, but by the end of next year, that will have to rise to around 50,000 premises a week, if the project is to stay on target. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) have found that a nationwide full-fibre broadband network would boost UK productivity by Â£59bn by 2025 - and updated modelling suggests it could enable nearly one million more people to access employment. Openreach says people will not need engineering skills to apply for the jobs - among its recent recruits have been shop workers, ex-servicemen and women and a trainee vet. In the past, Openreach has come under fire for failing to invest quickly enough and sticking with its legacy copper network for too long. New Openreach recruits being trained in a classroom in Peterborough this year According to Ofcom, there are almost 600,000 homes and businesses that do not have access to a broadband connection higher than 10Mbps. In July, Openreach pledged to make new fibre-to-the-property (FTTP) connections available to 3.2 million premises in 250 towns and villages, including Thurso in the far north of Scotland, Aberystwyth on Cardigan Bay in Wales and Lingfield in Surrey. One of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most ambitious election pledges was the promise of providing all homes and businesses in the UK with gigabit broadband speeds by 2025. It came with the promise of Â£5bn to get the job done - but in the spending review it was announced that only Â£1.2bn of that would be made available over the next four years. And Mr Johnson's pledge was lowered to 85% of homes. In November, internet and network providers pressed the government to clarify when it would be making the remaining Â£3.8bn available.

"Mohsin (left) and Zuber Issa in Blackburn last year A company co-owned by the billionaire Issa brothers who are buying Asda was fined for ""appalling"" safety breaches, a BBC investigation has found. One worker lost a finger in a bubble wrap machine in 2012, and another lost four fingers in 2015, weeks after the brothers resigned as directors. Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd showed ""a total lack of care about the safety of its employees"", according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The brothers declined to comment. In 2014, the Lancashire packaging firm Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd was fined Â£50,000 at Preston Crown Court for an incident two years previously, when a worker got a hand trapped between rollers while trying to clean a bubble wrap machine. He suffered burns and crush injuries, requiring skin grafts, and lost the top half of his middle finger. Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the billionaire petrol station bosseswho have agreed a deal to buy Asda for Â£6.8bn, were co-owners and directors of the company at the time, according to filings at Companies House. The court was told of two previous hand injuries at the company, which had been warned as early as 2009 of the need to guard dangerous machine parts, according to a press release issued by the HSE. Mohsin and Zuber Issa have agreed a deal to buy Asda HSE principal inspector Mike Sebastian said after the hearing that ""the company had failed to take any action to improve safety, despite receiving numerous warnings and at least two other workers also suffering injuries"". The factory was in an ""appalling"" state when the HSE visited, he said. ""There appears to have been a complete absence of any attempt to organise or control health and safety."" Mohsin and Zuber Issa are still investors in Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd, though they resigned as directors in June 2015, leaving their lower-profile older brother Zakir as sole director. Representatives of Mohsin and Zuber Issa declined to comment on this story. Zakir Issa and Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd did not respond to requests for comment. Billionaire Issa brothers buy German petrol chain Billionaire brothers' Asda takeover deal probed Who are Asda's new owners the Issa brothers? Two months after Mohsin and Zuber Issa resigned, in August 2015, another worker lost four fingers while cleaning a bubble wrap machine. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to this incident in 2017, paying a fine of Â£60,000. HSE inspector Steven Boyd said: ""These were life-changing injuries that could have been prevented. Sadly, in this case lessons from previous incidents had not been learned."" Preston Magistrates' Court heard that the machines were being cleaned while still running - a clear health and safety breach. The company was criticised for not reporting the incident until nine months after it happened, delaying the investigation and putting other employees at risk, according to the HSE. Zuber and Mohsin Issa have won awards for their entrepreneurship, and were made CBEs in October Europlast is a highly profitable firm, earning Â£2.7m on a turnover of Â£9.6m in the year to 30 March 2020. However, it doesn't feature in most accounts of the Issa brothers' meteoric rise. They started from a single filling station in Bury in 2001 to build a global petrol and convenience store empire stretching from the US to Australia with over 6,000 sites and â¬20bn (Â£18bn) of revenue, according to their company website. According to Companies House filings, however, they were already successful packaging entrepreneurs when they started Euro Garages (now called EG Group). Mohsin and Zakir Issa founded Europlast (Blackburn) Ltd in 1993 and Zuber Issa became a shareholder in 1998. The bubble wrap business helped to fund the growth of the fledgling forecourt empire. Accounts show that in 2002 Euro Garages received a Â£251,393 unsecured interest-free loan from Europlast, which continued to provide free credit in subsequent years. Their success with EG Group gave Mohsin and Zuber Issa the financial firepower to buy Asda from its previous owners, the US superstore group Walmart. In June 2015, the three brothers transferred their shares in Europlast to a Jersey holding company, now called EP Holdings. Mohsin and Zuber Issa each hold over a million preference shares in EP Holdings, which entitle them to a share of the company's profits, according to documents filed with the Jersey Financial Services Commission in September.

"Vehicles are stranded on the snow-covered Kanetsu expressway Rescuers are trying to free more than 1,000 vehicles which have been stranded on a highway for two days after a heavy snow storm struck Japan. Authorities have distributed food, fuel and blankets to the drivers on the Kanetsu expressway, which connects the capital Tokyo to Niigata, in the north. The snow, which began on Wednesday evening, has caused multiple traffic jams along the road. It has also left more than 10,000 homes in the north and west without power. A Kyodo News report said that there were multiple reports of congestion at different points of the Kanetsu expressway. The gridlock began when a trailer got stuck in snow on Wednesday night. Another Kyodo report, quoting police and highway operator East Nippon Expressway Co, said the traffic jam had stretched up to 16.5km (10 miles) along the road at one point. Officials have been using a combination of heavy machinery and physical labour to dig out the vehicles one by one, but around 1,000 cars were still stranded on the road as of Friday noon. ""We are trying our best to rescue drivers and passengers, we are ready to continue the operation through the night,"" a Niigata disaster management official told AFP on Thursday night. Food, fuel and blankets were distributed to drivers Another similar traffic jam also occurred in the nearby Joshinetsu Expressway which saw 300 vehicles stranded. That gridlock lasted from Wednesday to Thursday morning. According to the meteorological agency, the heavy snow - said to be this year's most intense cold spell - is expected to continue through the weekend. The country's prime minister Yoshihide Suga has called an emergency cabinet meeting and urged the public to be cautious.

"This video can not be played Before lockdown James was working on the extravagant touring UK musical, Priscilla: Queen of the Desert James Marsh had built a 15-year career as a sound engineer for big productions and other live events. But when theatres closed during the UK lockdown in March, he had to rethink his plans. Now James is a ""bin man"" and said he was grateful to have a job. While Wales sawthe highest rate of unemployment between August and Octoberof any nation or region of the UK, many people have taken on completely new jobs to sustain their income. In the UK, 6.1% of employed people changed their occupation in the first half of this year, compared with 5.7% in the same period last year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. James got a job working for Vale of Glamorgan council Before lockdown, James, 35, from Cardiff, was working on the extravagant touring UK musical, Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. On 16 March, the show was cancelled and James started looking for other work. After months of rejections, he was employed by Vale of Glamorgan council as a refuse collector in September. Wales jobs not yet hit by full force of lockdown Long-term unemployment could be 'similar to 1990s' It was a big change, with earlier shifts and a more physical working day. ""You're on your feet and you can do up to about 20km a day and it's hard work,"" said James. While James appreciates having a job while many other struggle to find work, he feels many of the skills he developed from his career are being ""wasted"". According to the Welsh campaign group We Make Events, about 10,000 live events could be lost before the sector recovers from Covid. Amy Buckle from Cardiff started her online store, Buckle and Boo Printhouse, from home Amy Buckle from Cardiff started her online store, Buckle and Boo Printhouse, from home. The 38-year-old mother of two started making uplifting decorative prints two years ago to help her cope, following a number of tragedies. In 2018, her mother died in an accident and the following year she lost her baby daughter, Hope, who was born at 21 weeks with a range of conditions. ""I noticed during this time the profound effect that words had on helping me get through,"" she said. Amy's husband, Dan, works in recruitment. During the lockdown much of his work disappeared so Amy decided to start making money from her craft. ""After a lot of chatting through with my husband we decided to take the plunge and invest in a high-end printer which would allow me to provide high class professional prints. ""So we used the lockdown to set up a business planâ¦ I've had quite a lot of repeat business which is lovely because that gives you a bit of confidence to keep going."" Rhys Maule used his skills with plant machinery to become a digger driver Rhys Maule, 25, has felt the sting of the sector shutdown as the owner of Pro LX Productions, a Cwmbran-based company which provides technical services for big events. In October he decided to use some of the skills from his day job in a different field and became a digger driver for an agency. ""We already use plant machinery on festivals like telehandler and forklifts and things like that so it wasn't a massive jump,"" he said. Rhys has been operating excavation machinery on a variety of sites, from new housing projects to archaeological digs. He enjoyed the break from running a business full-time but said ""nothing will ever beat the adrenaline rush of a live crowd during a gig"". For others, the lockdown served as a stepping stone towards running a business. Tumi Williams now makes vegan food from his home and sells through his social media accounts For more than 10 years, Tumi Williams has been setting up gigs in Cardiff, as well as touring festivals with his hip-hop band Afro Cluster. As the shutdown kicked in, he found the impact on him was not just the loss of income. To find a creative outlet and make some money he turned to cooking, starting a business called Jollof House Party, cooking vegan food from his Nigerian heritage. Tumi now does takeaway from home, selling through his social media accounts, and cooks at food markets and other events. He is also moving into new premises in the new year to expand his business. When lockdown ends he hopes to continue cooking and start playing live music again. Tumi, whose first baby is due in the next few weeks, said: ""When the baby comes I want to be at the top of my game. I want to be the best father I can be. ""I am optimistic that I can be at a festival, running my store and then run to play a set, and then come back to work while baby and mummy are enjoying themselves in the festival. ""Next summer could be me cooking and playing gigs, which for me sounds like the life.""

"Two rare Ferraris sold for Â£8.5m at auction A new lifeboat station has been built in north Wales after a businessman left the RNLI cars worth Â£8.5m in his will. Businessman and classic car enthusiast Richard Colton, died in 2015. He left two rare Ferraris to the charity, which later sold for about Â£8.5m at auction - the most valuable items ever left to the organisation in a single donation. Part of the money funded new equipment in Hastings, while Â£2.8m paid for the new station at Pwllheli, Gwynedd. Mr Colton left the RNLI a red 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB, which sold at auction for Â£6.6m, and a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4, which raised Â£1.93m. Work on the new boathouse is now complete, although Covid delayed the manufacturing of a new lifeboat - due to arrive in April. Pwllheli lifeboat operations manager Cliff Thomas said: ""Receiving this fantastic news really was a shock. What an exceptional Christmas gift for us all. ""This latest donation really is a humbling end to what has been a difficult year for everyone."" Clive Moore, Pwllheli coxswain, said: ""We are a small Welsh station and the move to the new building and site will mark a significant period in the history of the station. ""I find it remarkable and very humbling that a gentleman who had no seafaring connection should have the desire to support the RNLI through the sale of his treasured cars, and that we should now benefit at Pwllheli as a consequence of his generosity."" The local community has also raised Â£83,000 towards the new station.

"Six million doses could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval A second coronavirus vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said his agency would move quickly to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing the company to begin shipping millions of doses. President Donald Trump tweeted incorrectly that the vaccine had already been ""overwhelmingly approved"". The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved earlier. America has recorded more Covid-19 cases and deaths than any other and earlier this week, its death toll passed 300,000. The advisory panel on Thursday voted 20-0 with one abstention that the benefits of the Moderna vaccine outweighed the risks for those aged 18 and over. The same committee last week backed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, leading to its authorisation for emergency use the following day. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered Following the panel's endorsement, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said his agency had informed Moderna it would work ""rapidly"" towards issuing emergency use authorisation.

The US has agreed to purchase 200 million doses, and six million could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. What you need to know about vaccine safety When will I get a Covid vaccine in US? How do the Covid vaccines compare? ""To go from having a sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement,"" said Dr James Hildreth, a member of the expert panel and CEO of Meharry Medical College in Tennessee. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. The Pfizer jab requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second injection comes 28 days after the first. The company is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has said that if approved, the ""vast majority"" of its doses would be manufactured there. Pfizer's drug is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Other countries have also ordered the Moderna vaccine: InCanada,the government plans to get two million doses by March - part of a total 56 million doses TheUKhas already pre-ordered seven million doses TheEuropean Unionlast month announced a contract to purchase of 80 million doses - with an option to purchase up to 80 million more - once the vaccine is deemed safe and effective Japanhas signed up for 50 million doses,South Koreafor 20 million, andSwitzerlandhas ordered 7.5 million, according to data compiled by the Duke University Global Health Innovation Center The US began its Covid-19 vaccination drive earlier this week, after emergency approval was given to the vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. New York nurse Sandra Lindsay was among the first people in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine when the rollout began on Monday. Footage of her being vaccinated was streamed on the Twitter feed of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state was the epicentre of the US epidemic in the first wave earlier this year. ""I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history. I want to instil public confidence that the vaccine is safe. We're in a pandemic and so we all need to do our part,"" Ms Lindsay said. This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines submitted to US states say healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well Americans living in long-term care homes. Essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be at the back of the queue. At least 70% or 80% of the US population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, he said.

"A decision on whether stricter measures should be imposed after 27 December will be taken on Tuesday Scotland's health secretary has said all options remain on the table for Covid lockdown rules after the five-day Christmas easing period ends. There has been speculation that some areas of the country could have tighter restrictions imposed after 27 December. Jeane Freeman said nothing could be ""sensibly ruled out"" at this stage - with a decision due on Tuesday. She was speaking as three council areas prepared to move to a higher level of restrictions. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of Scotland'sfive-tiered system,externalfrom 18:00 on Friday. It means they will face stricter rules on movement, leisure and hospitality. Boris Johnson 'hoping to avoid' national lockdown Should you see your family at Christmas? What level of restrictions is your council in? The changes were announced on Tuesday, with the country's other 29 council areas remaining in their current levels. The move to level three means 500,000 people across the three areas will no longer be allowed to travel outside their own local authority boundaries unless it is classed as essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to completely stop serving alcohol, and must shut at 18:00. Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close, and indoor exercise, including gyms, will be restricted to individual workouts. Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian join 18 other councils in level three, meaning 80% of Scotland's population will now be under the level three restrictions. The Scottish Licensed Traders Association has warned that continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" The Scottish government is considering whether tougher lockdown rules should be imposed when the five-day Christmas easing period ends on 27 December. Cases of the virus are already increasing in some parts of the country, and are widely expected to spike in the new year as a result of the relaxed festive rules. Northern Ireland has already announced a new six-week lockdown from 26 December - while Wales will lockdown from 28 December, with reviews being carried every three weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but has admitted that Covid cases have already increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. Ms Freeman told the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing on Friday that the situation was currently better in Scotland, where she said hospitals were not under the same pressure as some other parts of the country. Pubs and other licensed premises in level three areas are not allowed to serve alcohol Ministers have previously said there will be no change to the current five-day period of more relaxed restrictions next week. But Ms Freeman said ""all options"" were still on the table after that, with a decision due to be announced on Tuesday. She added: ""I completely appreciate that everyone would love to know today what next week is going to be like. ""But it is not possible in the way that this virus operates, and the importance of looking really closely and carefully at the information we have and then using that to reach the best judgements we can make, for us to be able to do that at this point."" Christmas guidance to be toughened in Scotland What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Prof James Chalmers, of the University of Dundee, toldthe BBC's Good Morning Scotlandhe believed the Scottish government should have ""reversed"" the decision to relax measures over Christmas - and that Scotland was ""on course"" for another national lockdown. He said: ""I think if we continue on the current course that we have high levels of cases across the UK and Scotland and then we have a relaxation over Christmas, we're looking at a spike in cases in early January. ""The only way we've seen over the last year to control a big spike is to have national lockdowns so I think we're heading in the direction of a lockdown unless there's a change in policy."" New analysis released on Thursday suggested that the R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is spreading in Scotland - was now between 0.9 and 1.1. This was an increase from the previous week's report, which estimated R to be between 0.7 and 0.9. Meanwhile, NHS Borders has also warned that a rise in cases meant the region's infection rates are""no longer consistent"" with level one restrictions. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"An average of 115 referrals from helpline calls were made each month between April and November The number of referrals from the NSPCC about child abuse has increased by 79% since the UK-wide lockdown was imposed, according to the charity's data. Calls to its helpline resulted in 923 referrals to police and social services between April and November. Almost a third related to neglect and the charity warned more children could be at risk over Christmas. Wales' children's commissioner said the pandemic had a ""real and significant"" impact on the most vulnerable children. One caller to NSPCC Cymru's hotline reported concerns their neighbour's son was being neglected. They said they could hear the father screaming and shouting obscenities towards his three-year-old son. Child abuse calls to NSPCC up 20% since lockdown Firebreak lockdown 'has hit charities hard' Lack of abuse support 'will lead to deaths' ""This led to the boy crying constantly. The parents have no concern for their child, I've noticed the boy is regularly left in the garden for hours on end unsupervised,"" said the caller. ""There is also an excess of bin bags all ripped in the back garden. I only noticed this because of the smell that was emanating from it. It makes me sad and upset seeing the boy treated like this."" Calls to the NSPCC have resulted in more referrals to police and social services A mother also called as she was worried about her own son, who lived with his father. ""The father is unable to have a proper conversation about anything. The house is always a mess with lots of rubbish everywhere and my son is normally left to fend for himself,"" she said. ""I'm worried about the impact this is having on his emotional wellbeing. I can't keep quiet about this anymore, it's really worrying me, what should I do?"" There was an average of 115 referrals from helpline calls made each month between April and November, compared to the pre-lockdown average of 64. NSPCC analysis of the data showed the level of concern about emotional abuse, neglect and physical abuse remained well above the pre-pandemic average across the UK. Kamaljit Thandi, head of the NSPCC helpline, said: ""It's no secret that this Christmas is going to be a very different one and, for thousands of children, being stuck at home for the holidays will be a terrifying thought."" Children's commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland, said people should trust their instincts and not delay speaking up. ""During a year where many have spent long periods unable to socialise with friends and unable to attend their nursery, school or youth group, some children will have spent more time in a home where they do not feel safe. ""With infection rates so high in our communities and no clear timeframe for getting back to normal life, it's even more important than usual that people look out for signs of child abuse and contact their local child protection team, or Childline, if they are worried."" NSPCC Cymru has urged the Welsh Government to encourage the public to be extra vigilant, especially during the Christmas holidays and while schools are closed, to ensure children and families ""get the help they need"". It also said the government needed to invest long-term funding to support children recovering from adverse and traumatic experiences during lockdown. The Welsh Government said it was committed to working with safeguarding partners to do everything possible to prevent and tackle child abuse and to support children who have experienced it. ""Our national action plan sets out clear actions to prevent child sexual abuse, to protect children at risk and to support abused children,"" a spokesperson said. ""It was published in 2019 and actions are to be completed by 31 December 2021. The existing plan sets out the next steps which would then be taken, including considering evidence from a review of its implementation, in consultation with stakeholders, to decide on next steps.""

"Patients in hospital with coronavirus should be offered a follow-up six weeks later to check for ""long Covid"" symptoms, doctors are being advised. The guidance, drawn up by health officials across the UK, says the long-term effects can be ""significant"". They identified 28 of the most common symptoms, from breathlessness and dizziness to chest pain. Mental health problems including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly, have also been reported. ""Because this is a new condition, there is still much that we don't know about it,"" said Paul Chrisp of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which produces health guidance. The NHS has opened 69 specialist clinics across England to offer rehabilitation to people recovering from the disease. There is no single medical definition for long Covid. Two people recovering from an infection can have very different experiences. New guidelines written by the National Institute for Care Excellence (NICE), its counterpart the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the Royal College of GPs, list more than two dozen common long-term symptoms including breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing problems, headaches, loss of smell and dizziness and mental health problems. Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' It can destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,"" said one sufferer, Jade Gray-Christie. Pinning down exactly how many people are affected by the condition has proved difficult. Figures published by the ONSsuggest one in 10 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in a household survey still had symptoms 12 weeks later - but this is still experimental data. Published to help doctors diagnose and treat long Covid, the new guidance says the symptoms are often unpredictable, affecting patients in different ways at different times. It says the likelihood of developing longer-term complications is not thought to be linked to either the severity of the original infection or whether the patient has been admitted to hospital. It recommends that anyone discharged from hospital after Covid should be offered a video or phone call six weeks later to check for new or ongoing symptoms. Those with severe breathlessness or other respiratory problems should be offered a chest X-ray. Those who do not need hospital treatment but are still concerned about their health eight weeks after infection should also be offered a consultation and referred to rehabilitation or specialist services if needed. ""This [guidance] could help to relieve anxiety when people do not recover in the way they expect, particularly because symptoms can fluctuate and there are so many different symptoms reported,"" said Dr Chrisp, director of the Centre for Guidelines at NICE. NHS England said it is spending Â£10m to help fund a network of 69 long Covid clinics staffed by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, with another 12 sites planned for January. Patients cannot attend directly but must be referred by their doctor or GP. In Scotland and Wales, the idea is to adapt existing services and provide more community rehabilitation. One doctor welcomed the ""modest"" increase in NHS funding but said more needed to be done to avoid an ""epidemic of post-Covid disability"". ""All too often the NHS focuses on saving lives but neglects the needs of the survivors,"" said Michael Sharpe, professor of psychological medicine at the University of Oxford. ""We must not make that mistake this time. We need to mobilise again to reduce the risk of long-term disability in those who survived Covid-19.""

"PM Boris Johnson says he is ""hoping to avoid"" another national lockdown in England but that Covid-19 cases have increased ""very much"" in recent weeks. He chaired meetings on Friday, No 10 sources said, amid ""growing concerns"" about the spread of anew variant of Covidin south-east England. Health bosses have warned the NHS is already under significant pressure. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in England are full, with coronavirus adding to normal winter demands. Government scientists are continuing to evaluate the new strain and ministers have been discussing what action will be necessary to deal with this, sources said. Asked if people were going to be told to re-think their Christmas plans, a Downing Street source said: ""We are not there yet."" A separate government source suggested that travel restrictions were discussed, but it is not clear that they have been signed off. On Monday Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid the variant may be associated with the faster transmission of the virus in the South Eastbut there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Should you see your family at Christmas? Which places are moving into tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Meanwhile, the R number - which represents how many people each infected person passes the virus onto - has risen above 1 in the UK. The latest figure,calculated by the government's scientific advisers,,externalis estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2, up from between 0.9 and 1 last week. The UK recorded a further 28,507 cases on Friday, along with 489 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Official figures show Covid-19 cases have risen in the past week in England,driven by sharp increases in London, as well as rises in the South East and East Midlands. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Dr Katherine Henderson, said England and Scotland needed to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a grip of the virus, even if that meant ""full lockdown"". Asked whether England would end up following Northern Ireland and Wales into lockdown, Mr Johnson said: ""Obviously we are hoping very much that we'll be able to avoid anything like that, but the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks."" He said the Christmas rules, which are being relaxed across the UK between 23 and 27 December, were ""very much a maximum"" and ""not a target people should aim for"". The prime minister encouraged people to ""think about our elderly relatives"" to ""avoid spreading the disease"" over Christmas. He added that he hoped next year, with the rollout of the vaccine, would ""be very different indeed"". Earlier, hetweeted a message,externalwarning people planning to form ""Christmas bubbles"" in the UK to start minimising contact with people from outside their households from today. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""nobody wants a third lockdown"" but England's tiered system was ""not strong enough"". He called for the prime minister to ""toughen up over Christmas"", saying the Welsh government's decision to limit Christmas bubbles to two households, instead of three, was a ""step in the right direction"". Prof Neil Ferguson, whose team's modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said he was ""more concerned"" about what the country was going to be facing in early January than over the Christmas period itself. The epidemiologist from Imperial College London told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that very rapid increases in case numbers had left ""very little headroom"", adding that any future lockdown in England may have to be tougher than the one seen in November. Meanwhile,teaching unions have criticised the government's announcement that the return to secondary school in January will be staggeredto allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme. They say the move came too late for them to make the necessary preparations for testing. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has defended the plan, saying the government would provide support. It comes aftera tough new six-week lockdown was announced in Northern Irelandfrom 26 December. Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures were essentially a return to March's sustained restrictions, with non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hair salons having to close. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the restrictions, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops, including supermarkets, having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. In Wales,non-essential shops will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. In England, some 38 million people will be subject to the nation's strictest measures - tier three - from Saturday. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the option for a post-Christmas lockdown in Scotland ""remains on the table"". Meanwhile, documents released by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say avoiding social contacts for more than five days before meeting older or vulnerable people at Christmas will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. A longer period - of a week or more - would reduce the risk even further. A document dated 26 November says taking a rapid coronavirus test before a multi-day gathering inside a home could also reduce the risk. Sage says mixing between households over the festive period for one or two days would be less risky than multiple households spending the entire time together. But the documents warn there may be a higher proportion of cases in more vulnerable age groups during the festive period, which could lead to an increase in hospital admissions. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The decision by all four UK nations to relax restrictions and allow more mixing for five days over Christmashas prompted concern that it will fuel a further surge in case numbers. Average NHS bed occupancy in England has reached almost 89% for the week ending 13 December, with 59 out of 126 NHS trusts reporting bed occupancy of higher than 90% - which is above the recommended safe level. Dr Katherine Henderson told BBC News the UK was at a ""really dangerous point where we could tip into finding it incredibly difficult to manage"" and her colleagues were ""increasingly"" seeing ambulances queuing outside hospitals. In Northern Ireland, Dr Martin Kelly, a consultant respiratory physician in Londonderry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Right in the mouth of Christmas we're seeing a significant further surge in numbers which is already putting the service under significant pressure."" And Dr Nick Lyons, a health board medical director in south Wales, said things were similar in his region, where non-urgent procedures have been cancelled. The intensive care units ""were basically full with Covid patients"" while the area's field hospital was ""roughly at half its total capacity"", he told Today.

"The Covid pandemic has exposed ""profound shortcomings"" in the UK's oversight of national security, a parliamentary report has said. The Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy said problems the UK has faced reflect gaps in the planning and preparation for biological risks. A pandemic has been categorised among the highest security risks since 2010. But thereport,externalsays the only major planning exercise in the last decade left some critical areas untested. The MPs and peers on the committee added that local authorities and emergency responders have sometimes lacked the intelligence and support they need from central government to carry out their role in biological security effectively. Insufficient attention had also been paid to areas like detection, they say. UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacks UK facing 'nasty mix' of threats, says MI5 chief New government unit to take over Covid response The UK's preparations for a significant disease outbreak had mainly focused on a flu pandemic. But the report says the ""novel features of Covid-19"", such as its high level of infectiousness compared with the flu, do not fully explain the government's ""inadequate response"". ""Insufficient attention was paid to important capabilities,"" they said, in areas including testing, isolation and contact-tracing capabilities. They say the pandemic also exposed vulnerabilities in the supply of personal protective equipment and in tackling false or misleading information online. When the UK first published its list of top tier security threats a decade ago, a pandemic was there as part of the category covering a major accident or natural hazard. But compared with the other three big risks listed - terrorism, cyber-attack and a major military crisis - there is no doubt that it received less attention and funding. Counter-terrorism scenarios are exercised regularly, the military - despite battles over budget - receives plenty of attention and cyber-security has risen up the agenda rapidly in the last decade, including with the creation of a new National Cyber Security Centre. But natural hazards, and particularly bio-security, have felt more like the poor relation and this report argues the pandemic exposed those failings. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? The committee calls for a minister to report annually to Parliament on the state of national preparedness for all top-tier risks, regular exercises to prepare for them and a task force to focus specifically on biological security. The chair of the committee, Dame Margaret Beckett, said ""the pandemic in the UK was not unpredicted... it is clear that the government could have, and should have, done more to prepare"". She added: ""Its negligence of key capabilities led to unnecessary fumbling for solutions, when instead the country needed decisive action. ""The government at times seems to have treated a vaccine as a 'fix-all', with little pre-consideration of our capabilities for detecting where the virus is and bringing cases under control.""

"We've all seen the pop-ups on our laptops or phones: ""Update is available, click here to download."" We're constantly urged to do as we're told because these software updates improve our apps by boosting cyber-security and removing glitches. So when, in the spring, a pop-up message hit the screens of IT staff using a popular piece of software called SolarWinds, around 18,000 workers in companies and governments diligently downloaded the update for their offices. What they couldn't have known was that the download was booby-trapped. SolarWinds itself didn't know either. The US company had been the victim of a cyber-attack weeks previously that had seen hackers inject a tiny piece of secret code into the company's next software update. After staying dormant for a couple of weeks, the powerful digital helper sprang to life inside thousands of computer networks in government, technology and telecom organisations across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The US Department of Homeland Security is reported to have been breached The undetected digital agent then called home over the internet letting its creator know that it was inside and that it could hold the door open for them to enter too. For months the hackers, highly likely to be a national cyber-military team, could take their pick, spying on and stealing information, whizzing around thousands of different organisations. The most high-profile victim so far, which was also probably the prime target, is the US government. More US government agencies hacked US treasury and commerce departments hacked Multiple office networks are reported to have been compromised including the treasury and commerce departments and Homeland Security. Governmental and private organisations around the world are now scrambling to disable the affected SolarWinds products from their systems. Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks. This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody Experts say the way the hackers gained entry to their victims is particularly concerning for national security. ""Governments are unequipped to compete with Silicon Valley and develop their own complex software suites in-house, thus the dependence on external supply chains which are increasingly becoming a target for hackers,"" said Jackie Singh, who was a lead cyber-security expert on the Joe Biden presidential campaign and founder of Spyglass Security. ""If a group of well-funded hackers can succeed in modifying just a bit of code somewhere and getting folks to install it as part of a legitimate software suite, they are gaining insider access to organisations which may be otherwise impenetrable, such as governments."" There is no suggestion that supply chain attacks should put the general public off from accepting software updates, as this is an extremely rare case. However, Brian Lord, former deputy director of cyber-operations at UK intelligence agency GCHQ, agrees it is ""the underlying access tactic that is the most concerning issue"". The national intelligence side of the hack is also extremely worrying. According to Reuters, emails sent by officials at the Department of Homeland Security - which oversees border security and defence against hacking - were monitored by the hackers. Experts fear the attack may escalate cyber-skirmishes between the US and rivals Experts say the case highlights that government communications are vulnerable to the same hacks as private companies. Mr Lord, who now runs cyber-security company PGI, said: ""The victims here are key to our national and personal economic well-being, and protection is essential to allow us to function safely in a digital world. ""The fact the hackers can dance unopposed simultaneously into such a breadth of huge organisations through the same means should worry us. The spectrum of mischief and damage they can cause is both significant and global."" Security teams in all affected organisations could take months trying to figure out which emails were read, documents stolen or passwords compromised in the hack. It's not known yet, and we may never be told, what sort of government information was stolen but Mr Lord says the most sensitive communications should still be safe. ""I think it is fair to say that the additional layers of security around top secret and highly classified stuff will be protected by internal controls, so direct access to those is unlikely."" The hackers probably didn't have the time or resources to carry out major surveillance on more than a small number of their possible victims, with government departments the most likely targets. Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security researcher at the University of Surrey, says: ""Post Cold War, this is one of the potentially largest penetrations of Western governments that I'm aware of. ""Just think about why countries conduct espionage. It's to give them an advantage, and that isn't necessarily just a military advantage, especially in peace time: use of intelligence in gaining economic advantage in all sorts of ways is a major aspect of why countries have intelligence-gathering operations. ""There is also the personal dimension. We saw that when the Office of Personnel Management was hacked in the US, the private details of many government employees were potentially accessed. These details are reserved for those who have undergone security vetting and are incredibly sensitive."" Prof Woodward, like many in the security world, says the attack has the hallmarks of a Russian operation, although this cannot yet be confirmed. Others, including researchers at FireEye, which discovered the hack after falling victim themselves, is pointing at a known Russian government team known as Cosy Bear. Russia's foreign ministry described the allegations as baseless, in a statement on Facebook. It could be months before we see a US response, but it's likely that if the US government does conclude it was Russia there could be geopolitical consequences. Cyber-attack responder Marina Krotofil, who used to work for FireEye, says the hack may increase tensions. ""In past years, the USA has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia, including the most recent indictment of the Russian military hackers. However, Russia explicitly demonstrates that they are not intimidated and are not going to slow down with their cyber-activities. This will further escalate relationships between the US and Russia and in the long run, and create severe political conflicts."" The 'Sunburst' hack may well represent a major salvo in the virtual skirmishes between rival nations - an escalation which could have serious consequences.

"A growing number of US government agencies have been targeted in a sophisticated hack. The US Treasury and departments of homeland security, state, defence and commerce were attacked, reports say. SolarWinds Orion, the computer network tool at the source of the breach, said 18,000 of its 300,000 customers might have been affected. Many suspect the Russian government is responsible for the attack, but it denied the claims as ""baseless"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is unclear what information has been stolen or exposed in the hack, but the attackers have been monitoring networks since March and were active as recently as Sunday,the Washington Post reports,external. The attacks were first revealedby Reuters,external, identifying breaches at the Treasury and homeland security, the department which manages cyber-security for the US government. Parts of the defence department were also breached,the New York Times reports,external, while the Washington Post says that the state department and National Institutes of Health were hacked. The UK's intelligence agency GCHQ is currently monitoring the situation and has described the compromises as ""serious events"". A number of UK government departments and other organisations use SolarWinds but its unclear if they use Orion. The list of identified victims is expected to grow as more information about the incident emerges. This video can not be played Obama's former director of cyber security warns Radio 4's Today Russia election hacking is like 'playbook' SolarWinds Orion's software allows IT staff to remotely access computers on corporate networks. In a so-called ""supply-chain attack"", hackers gained access to SolarWinds Orion and then had access to all of its customers' networks. FireEye, a company that provides US government cyber-security, identified the large-scale campaign afterit fell victim to the hackers in a separate attack. The actors manipulated SolarWinds Orion's software updates to include malware which, once installed, allowed the hackers to monitor its customers' systems, Fireye said. ""We have been advised this attack was likely conducted by an outside nation state and intended to be a narrow, extremely targeted, and manually executed attack, as opposed to a broad, system-wide attack,"" SolarWinds said in a statement on its website. It urged all users of its Orion platform to update their software immediately for security. FireEye's own hacking tools, which are used to carry out fake attacks on its customers, were stolen by the same actors, it said. By mimicking the behaviour of hackers, it uses these programmes to investigate the security of different organisations and offer advice on how to protect vulnerabilities. Since the discovery, there is evidence that these tools have already been used in 19 countries including the US, UK and Ireland, Raj Samani, chief scientist at leading cyber-security firm McAfee said.

FireEye hasnow released,externalmore than 300 countermeasures to detect the use of its stolen tools and to minimise the potential impact if they are used. When the experts investigating a cyber-attack downgrade their estimate of the number of people affected, it's normally a good thing. So when SolarWinds says the number of organisations that could have been spied upon through its products is not the 300,000 initially feared, you'd think it would be cause for slight consolation. Unfortunately, this is almost completely irrelevant. Like all cyber-attacks, it's not about the quantity of victims but their quality. You don't get much higher quality targets than US government departments. The other key number in this hack is eight. That's how many months it's thought the hackers had access to SolarWinds and could have started to snoop, poke around or steal sensitive material from their customers. The thing we don't know, and may never know, is what the quality of the information stolen is. It's unlikely that top-level government communications would have been breached - those are likely to be heavily encrypted and sent on separate systems. But like any offices, sometimes important operational documents, snippets of information or even the digital keys to other parts of a business are left lying around in places they shouldn't be. The investigation into this hack will be months long and its consequences could take years to be realised.

"The US has not said who is behind the attack on its treasury and commerce departments US federal agencies have been hacked in a way that may have let a foreign power monitor government communications. The Treasury and commerce department have both been attacked. And all federal civilian agencies have been told to disconnect from SolarWinds Orion, a computer network tool being exploited by ""malicious actors"". FireEye, a company that provides US government cyber-security, says it identified the problem after its own hacking tools were stolen last week. Government, technology and telecom organisations across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East had all fallen victim to  ""a global campaign"" employing ""top-tier operations tradecraft and resources"", FireEye said. And this was consistent with state-sponsored attackers ""patiently conducting reconnaissance [and] consistently covering their tracks"". The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was working closely with FireEye. ""Investigations are ongoing, and we are working extensively with partners and stakeholders to assess any UK impact,"" it said. SolarWinds said its 300,000 global customers included all five branches of the US military, the Pentagon, the State Department and the Office of the President of the United States - and all users of its Orion platform should upgrade immediately to address a ""security vulnerability"". Updates to keep the system secure had been compromised with malicious code, in a ""highly sophisticated... extremely targeted"" attack, probably by a nation state, between March and June this year, it said. The powerful monitoring software allows IT staff remote access to computers on corporate networks. And the fact the attackers had been able to monitor internal Treasury Department emails may be just the ""tip of the iceberg"", the Reuters news agency reported. The head of GCHQ has described the compromises as ""serious events"" and British intelligence officials are now racing to see what exposure the UK may have. A number of UK government departments and other organisations use SolarWinds. The first task is to establish whether they were using a particular software package - Orion. If they do and they have it configured in a particular way and took an update since the end of March they may have a backdoor installed in their system. The next question will be whether hackers used that access to steal data. Not everyone may be seen as a target worth exploiting. The US was a few days ahead in learning about the compromise and checking its systems. The UK has begun that process but it could take days or weeks to find answers since the scale, sources say, is huge. The impact is potentially significant but no one can be sure yet. This was, intelligence officials say, a highly sophisticated operation but they are wary of attributing it to a particular group or state. Some US reports have identified Russia's SVR intelligence agency but UK officials say it is too early to comment. Three people familiar with the investigations into the attack told Reuters Russia was believed to be behind it. But Russia's foreign ministry described the allegations as ""baseless"",in a statement on Facebook,external. In an emergency order,external, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) said the attack had a high potential to compromise government systems. And the US Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal agencies to disconnect and power down any device connected to SolarWinds products until further notice. US National Security Council official John Ullyot said the government was ""taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation"". In the world of cyber-security it's often hard to work out the scale of hacks. We are told as little as possible and often the victims don't know much themselves at first. So when, last week, it was revealed FireEye had been hacked, it was like watching a horror film where the main character is looking through a dark basement and her torch lights up something sinister. The latest news is akin to a switch being flicked and the full horror scene being revealed. It turns out FireEye was just a small part of a much larger and more serious hack attack. The so-called supply-chain attack means hackers effectively have access to all of SolarWinds's customers. And looking at its client list - with some household-name companies and the US military - is truly chilling. US government cyber-teams are in full crisis mode now - but once a hack has been discovered, it's often too late.

"Google is being sued by 38 US states, accused of trying to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in smartphones. This follows a landmark lawsuit by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over a similar issue in October. It is the tech giant's third US government-related lawsuit in two months. Google saidin a blog,externalthat redesigning its search engine would ""deprive Americans of helpful information"". ""We know that scrutiny of big companies is important and we're prepared to answer questions and work through the issues,"" wrote Google's director of economic policy Adam Cohen. ""But this lawsuit seeks to redesign Search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses' ability to connect directly with customers. We look forward to making that case in court, while remaining focused on delivering a high-quality search experience for our users."" US files landmark lawsuit against Google Google ad practices under fire in new lawsuit He added that there are many alternatives to Google when looking for relevant information, including Amazon, Expedia and Tripadvisor. The tech giant's view is that the lawsuit is suggesting that Google Search ""should, in fact, be less useful"" to consumers. ""When you search for local products and services, we show information that helps you connect with businesses directly and helps them reach more customers,"" wrote Mr Cohen. ""This lawsuit demands changes to the design of Google Search, requiring us to prominently feature online middlemen in place of direct connections to businesses."" An animated gif showing what Google calls ""rich results"" when searching for the word ""bread"" The complaint was filed on Thursday by 38 states and territories with both Democrat and Republican prosecutors, led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. ""Google's anticompetitive actions have protected its general search monopolies and excluded rivals, depriving consumers of the benefits of competitive choices, forestalling innovation, and undermining new entry or expansion,"" Mr Weiser explained. ""This lawsuit seeks to restore competition."" It is a separate matter to the lawsuit filed on Wednesdayin which 10 US states accuse Google of anti-competitive online advertising practices, including an allegation that it made a deal with Facebook to manipulate online advertising auctions. In some ways, the latest complaint is similar to the DoJ's lawsuit, which focused on the billions of dollars Google pays each year to ensure its search engine is installed as the default option on browsers and devices like mobile phones. However, the latest legal complaint goes further to say that the tech giant is using its existing monopolies in search - such as ""exclusionary agreements"" and its ability to collect ""vast amounts of data"" - to dominate newer technologies as well. For instance, the lawsuit claims Google bars devices that use Google Assistant from including competing virtual assistant technology, such as Amazon's Alexa. Smart speaker maker Sonos has publicly complained that Google used its market power unfairly to monopolise the voice assistant market ""Google is preventing competitors in the voice assistant market from reaching consumers through connected cars, which stand to be a significant way the internet is accessed in the near future,"" said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who also sued Microsoft back in 1998 over antitrust issues. Smart speaker maker Sonos has publicly complained in the past that Google used its market power unfairly to monopolise the voice assistant market. Sonos only finally decided to support the Google Assistant in 2019. The coalition is asking the court to halt what it calls Google's illegal conduct and restore a competitive marketplace, as well as removing any unfair advantages the tech giant gained as a result of its practices. It calls for Google's parent Alphabet to be forced to divest some assets and award damages, instead of paying a fine. ""Fines are like kicking gorillas in the shin. We fortunately have remedies that are much broader in scope,""  said Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson. The states who filed the lawsuit on Thursday are: Colorado, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico.

"Smoke from wildfires could be a surprising new route for the spread of infections, according to research. Scientist say that microbes and fungi can survive in large numbers in smoky plumes. The authors believe it's likely that organisms from the soil, known to cause infection, could be transferred in this way. They argue that greater monitoring of wildfire smoke by health authorities is urgently needed. Heathrow wins court battle to build third runway 'Not enough' climate ambition shown by leaders EU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% For decades, it has been widely assumed that nothing much lives in a plume of wildfire smoke. It has also been assumed that if smoke poses a threat to human health, it's because it is full of particulate matter. These microscopic particles of soot are known to be a severe irritant, causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues. However, there has been growing concern that wildfire smoke could also carry infectious microbes or fungi. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC0 says that firefighters are at risk of coccidioidomycosis, a common infection caused by a fungus that becomes airborne when soils are disturbed. Scientists prepare to use a drone to gather smoke samples Scientists are now beginning to uncover the scale of the potential infectious threat posed by smoke from wildfires. Using new techniques to capture microbes in smoke, researchers say that they found over 900 different types of bacteria and around 100 unique fungi. ""The diversity of microbes we have found so far in the very few studies that have been done is impressive,"" said Dr Leda Kobziar, from the University of Idaho, in Moscow, US, who led the review. ""These taxa (groups of living organisms) were not found in non-smoky air in the same locations prior to the fire, proving that combustion and its associated winds aerosolise microbes into smoke columns."" The researchers believe that the microbes hitch-hike on particulate matter in the smoke. Microbial colonies grown from smoke samples Even in high-intensity fires, the scientists found bacteria in abundance 300 metres above a fire. Over 60% of these were viable. They suspect that the particulate matter on which they are travelling protects the microbes from ultraviolet radiation, which might kill them off. While the scientists have shown that there are large numbers of bacteria in smoke and that they can survive in the plume, the key question is how much of a threat to health do they pose? ""We have found a number of microbes that are commonly known to cause respiratory ailments - things that can trigger asthma, for example,"" Dr Kobziar said, via email. ""The likelihood of soil and plant-borne organisms known to cause infection is high, but has yet to be experimentally tested."" Previous studies with hurricanes and storms have shown that these infectious agents can travel extremely long distances, although no one has yet shown a similar journey for bacteria in a smoke plume. But the ability of smoke to travel around the world suggests that it could be a ""missing link"" in explaining some patterns of infection. ""When infections are detected in patients, the potential causal agents that are screened are based on what is known to be endemic in a given region,"" said Dr Kobziar. ""However, smoke blurs the lines between regions. It may be that many cases of infection with undetermined causal agents have occurred due to smoke transport of microbes outside of their areas where it is endemic. ""It may be that smoke is the missing link to explain some of these patterns of infection across space and time."" She added: ""This could also have ecological ramifications.""

"The berg is a little over 130km in length. The small broken chunk is just visible through the cloud The icy colossus that is A68a has knocked off a corner, seemingly as a result of striking the seafloor. The 3,800-sq-km iceberg, which has been bearing down on the island ofSouth Georgia,external, looked in recent days to be turning with the prevailing current. But as it spun around, it appears part of the frozen block may have scraped the bed, inflicting damage on itself. Satellite images on Thursday revealed a roughly 150-sq-km chunk to be floating free of the main berg. The new piece of debris is so large that it's likely from now on to be called A68d, under the iceberg nomenclature operated by the US National Ice Center. Two other large lumps that broke away previously from the primary block were designated A68b and A68c. Mission to investigate gigantic iceberg A68a RAF cameras capture world's biggest iceberg World's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edges Originating in Antarctica in 2017, A68a is the world's largest iceberg ""in the open ocean"". There is another great tabular berg called A23a which is slightly bigger but this has hardly moved from its calving position at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. A68a, on the other hand, has travelled more than 1,500km in the past 3.5 years to get up into the South Atlantic. It's running in a fast stream of water known as the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, which is one of the White Continent's main export routes for ice. The SACCF is like a conveyor belt that routinely delivers icebergs to the vicinity of South Georgia. Indeed, it's often said the British Overseas Territory is ""where icebergs go to die"" because so many get caught on the island's shallow continental shelf and end their days melting to nothing. Scientists are watching A68a with greater than normal interest. Its great bulk means that if it anchors at South Georgia, it could pose feeding problems for the island's famous penguins and seals. The shallow continental shelf extends 50-80km from the coastline Such a major obstacle sitting right offshore might restrict the animals' ability to forage for the fish and small crustaceans called krill on which they depend. Satellites are following the trajectory of the berg day by day. As predicted, it has turned with the SACCF at that point where the current gets deflected by continental shelf. If A68a continues to drift in SACCF, it should loop south around the island before turning north. This video can not be played Watch: The RAF flies over iceberg A68a The iceberg came from a part of the Antarctic where it is still very cold - the Larsen C Ice Shelf. This is a mass of floating ice formed by glaciers that have flowed down off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula into the ocean. On entering the water, the glaciers' buoyant fronts lift up and join together to make a single protrusion. The calving of bergs at the forward edge of this shelf is a very natural behaviour. The shelf likes to maintain an equilibrium and the ejection of bergs is one way it balances the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. Larsen C calves big icebergs like A68 on decadal timescales. The main iceberg is constantly now shedding debris The satellite images on this page were prepared byPierre Markuse,externalandStef Lhermitte,external.

"Six million doses could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval A second coronavirus vaccine is nearing emergency approval in the US after it was endorsed by a panel of experts. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said his agency would move quickly to authorise the Moderna vaccine, allowing the company to begin shipping millions of doses. President Donald Trump tweeted incorrectly that the vaccine had already been ""overwhelmingly approved"". The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved earlier. America has recorded more Covid-19 cases and deaths than any other and earlier this week, its death toll passed 300,000. The advisory panel on Thursday voted 20-0 with one abstention that the benefits of the Moderna vaccine outweighed the risks for those aged 18 and over. The same committee last week backed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, leading to its authorisation for emergency use the following day. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered Following the panel's endorsement, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said his agency had informed Moderna it would work ""rapidly"" towards issuing emergency use authorisation. Yet Mr Trump posted without confirmation from the FDA that the vaccine had been ""overwhelmingly approved"" and distribution would ""start immediately"". Allow Twitter content?

Regulators reported earlier this week thatthe Moderna vaccine was safe and 94% effective. The US has agreed to purchase 200 million doses, and six million could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. What you need to know about vaccine safety When will I get a Covid vaccine in US? How do the Covid vaccines compare? ""To go from having a sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement,"" said Dr James Hildreth, a member of the expert panel and CEO of Meharry Medical College in Tennessee. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. The Pfizer jab requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second injection comes 28 days after the first. The company is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has said that if approved, the ""vast majority"" of its doses would be manufactured there. Pfizer's drug is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Other countries have also ordered the Moderna vaccine: InCanada,the government plans to get two million doses by March - part of a total 56 million doses TheUKhas already pre-ordered seven million doses TheEuropean Unionlast month announced a contract to purchase of 80 million doses - with an option to purchase up to 80 million more - once the vaccine is deemed safe and effective Japanhas signed up for 50 million doses,South Koreafor 20 million, andSwitzerlandhas ordered 7.5 million, according to data compiled by the Duke University Global Health Innovation Center The US began its Covid-19 vaccination drive earlier this week, after emergency approval was given to the vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. New York nurse Sandra Lindsay was among the first people in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine when the rollout began on Monday. Footage of her being vaccinated was streamed on the Twitter feed of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state was the epicentre of the US epidemic in the first wave earlier this year. ""I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history. I want to instil public confidence that the vaccine is safe. We're in a pandemic and so we all need to do our part,"" Ms Lindsay said. This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines submitted to US states say healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well Americans living in long-term care homes. Essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist of federal vaccine distribution programme Operation Warp Speed, says the young and healthy should be at the back of the queue. At least 70% or 80% of the US population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, he said.
