"Actor Sylvester Stallone (right) and boxer Deontay Wilder (left) were present for the pardon signing US President Donald Trump has pardoned boxing's first black heavyweight champ, convicted in 1913 of taking his white girlfriend across state lines. Joined in the Oval Office by actor Sylvester Stallone and boxer Lennox Lewis, Mr Trump said the move corrected a historic US wrong to Jack Johnson. Johnson was arrested in 1912 with Lucille Cameron, a white woman who would later become his wife. He was world heavyweight title holder from 1908 until 1915. Mr Trump shook hands with current and former heavyweight champions at the White House during the announcement of the full pardon on Thursday. Boxer Jack Johnson's fight against inequality Johnson's story was dramatised in Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Great White Hope Linda Bell Haywood, the maternal great-great niece of Jack Johnson, was also present, as was current heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. ""I've issued an executive grant of clemency, a full pardon posthumously to Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight champion of the world,"" Mr Trump said. ""He served 10 months for what many view as a racially motivated injustice."" ""Keep punching, Jack,"" Mr Stallone said at the Oval Office announcement Mr Trump had said he was considering pardoning Johnson back in April, after Mr Stallone brought the case to his attention. ""Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson,"" Mr Trump said last month on Twitter. ""His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial."" Jack Johnson (R) lost his title in 1915 to Jess Willard in a 26th round knockout During the announcement, Stallone - who famously depicted a boxer in the 1977 film Rocky - lifted his head upwards and said: ""Keep punching, Jack."" ""Thank you all! Justice has been done!"" he tweeted after the announcement. Mr Trump also jabbed former president Barack Obama, saying that many people ""thought it was going to be signed in the last administration, and that did not happen, so it was disappointing for a lot of people"". Mr Obama had declined to pardon Johnson, in part due to allegations of domestic abuse, according to the New York Times. Born in Galveston, Texas, to former slaves, he became the first African American to win the world heavyweight crown in 1908, defeating Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia. He held on to that title until 1915 when Jess Willard, a white cowboy from Kansas, took the title with a knockout in the 26th round in Havana, Cuba. In 1910, when Johnson defeated ""great white hope"" Jim Jeffries in the so-called Fight of the Century in Reno, Nevada, race riots erupted across the nation, claiming more than 20 lives. Johnson's story was dramatised in Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Great White Hope, starring James Earl Jones in 1969. Johnson and his wife, photographed in 1924 He was charged with violating the 1910 Mann Act, a so-called moral purity law that made it illegal to transport women across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. US prosecutors argued that Johnson's relationship with Lucille Cameron was a ""crime against nature"", and an all-white jury took less than two hours to convict him. His career in ruins, Johnson skipped bail and fled to Europe to live in exile. He spent years fighting overseas before surrendering to US authorities in 1920. He served 10 months in prison. In 1946, he died in a car crash.

"This video can not be played The attack on the family's house in Salford was captured on CCTV Two men who murdered four children by torching their home with petrol bombs have been given life sentences. Zak Bolland, 23, and David Worrall, 26, were convicted of murdering Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson in Walkden, Salford in December. Courtney Brierley, 20, was cleared of their murders but found guilty of four counts of manslaughter following the blaze. Bolland was jailed for a minimum of 40 years and Worrall for 37 years. A judge at Manchester Crown Court also sentenced Brierley to 21 years in a young offenders institution. Mr Justice William Davis said the four children ""died a terrible death"". Sandra Lever, the children's grandmother, said the offenders were ""evil"". ""To think and do anything like this with four babies in the house, and a woman, and two other children, it's just beyond me."" Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma The jury heard Bolland, who lived 300 yards from the Pearsons, was high on drink and drugs when he launched the fatal attack, which was motivated by a petty feud with the victims' 17-year-old brother Kyle Pearson. Along with Worrall, he filled two glass bottles with Â£1.50 of petrol bought from a local garage, stuffing the tops with tissue paper as they prepared the attack shortly before 05:00 GMT. They removed a fence panel from the garden of the family's home in Jackson Street, smashed a kitchen window and threw in the two lit petrol bombs. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Zak Bolland (left) and David Worrall were found guilty of the murders of four siblings Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, all died in the blaze. Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 36, was rescued, severely injured, along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Neighbour Karen Kormoss told the jury during the murder trial Mrs Pearson screamed ""not the kids"" as the flames took hold. She said she saw the windows blown out and flames coming from upstairs and downstairs within two minutes. Bolland and Worrall threw two lit petrol bombs at the family's home Mrs Pearson dialled 999 but she was overcome with heat and smoke before completing the call. She spent four months in a coma and still suffers with dreadful burns and has had several infections. She has been told about the deaths of her children but ""it's questionable how much she's absorbed and is aware of what she's been told"", the court heard. Bolland was found guilty of three counts of the attempted murder of Mrs Pearson, Kyle, and his friend Bobby Harris who was staying at their house. Worrall, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Bolland's then-girlfriend Courtney Brierley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter Worrall and Brierley broke down in tears as the verdicts were read out in court. Bolland blinked and looked down to the floor. The court heard Bolland was friends with Kyle until the defendant's car was set on fire and his house windows smashed and he blamed the teenager. Mrs Pearson had called police on at least five occasions in the two weeks before her children died, saying Bolland was threatening to use fire to harm her family. He set their wheelie bin on fire two days before the fatal fire and threatened to ""kill 'em all"" four hours before he torched the house, the court heard. CCTV shown to the jury showed Bolland and Worrall at the address at 04:55 for one minute and five seconds. The cameras recorded a flash then a larger second one from the petrol bombs, before they fled. Bolland, who admitted throwing the second petrol bomb but denied all other charges said he intended only to damage the house which he thought was not occupied. ""I heard like a big whoosh. I didn't look back,"" he told the jury. Zak Bolland lived 300 yards from the Pearsons Worrall, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, said he thought they were only going to set fire to wheelie bins and denied throwing a petrol bomb. Brierley, from Walkden, said she did not know the two men had petrol bombs and claims Bolland had a ""controlling influence"" over her during their ""toxic"" relationship. Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said it was one of the ""most heartbreaking cases"" he had ever dealt with. ""I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children,"" he said. An investigation into Greater Manchester Police by the Independent Office for Police Conduct was suspended pending the outcome of the trial.

"The sharp differences in household incomes across the UK have been set out in official government statistics. The average disposable income per person (the ONS calls this household income), once taxes and benefits are accounted, was Â£19,432 in 2016. But in Kensington & Chelsea and Hammersmith & Fulham in west London the average income was more than three times this at Â£58,816. In contrast, in Nottingham  - which has the lowest household income - the average income was Â£12,232. Wetake a look at the figures,externalin four charts which show the disparity in incomes depending on where people live across the UK. England had the highest disposable income in the UK in 2016 of Â£19,878. In contrast, Northern Ireland had the lowest disposable income of Â£15,719. England was also the only nation with a disposable income higher than the UK average. But the strongest growth in incomes in 2016, compared to 2015, was in Scotland where incomes rose by 1.2%. In contrast, England saw the slowest growth, with average incomes up by just 0.6% in 2016. Average disposable income increased in all regions last year apart from in the North East and North West, which fell by 0.6% and 0.2% respectively. The largest percentage increase was in the East of England at 1.3%, followed by Scotland at 1.2%. The smallest percentage increase was in the South East at 0.3%, whilst the South West region remained flat. The places with the highest disposable household income in 2016 are still in London and the south East. The top seven places have remained unchanged since 2015, and the top five areas are all in London. Despite having the highest disposable income per head, Kensington & Chelsea and Hammersmith & Fulham showed a decline in growth between 2015 and 2016 of 1.3%. The areas which had the least disposable income in 2016 were all within the north and midland regions of England, except for Derry City and Strabane in Northern Ireland. Nottingham had the lowest disposable income per head in 2016, at 37.1% below the UK average. This was followed by Blackburn with Darwen and Leicester.

"This video can not be played Meet the women who travelled #HomeToVote on Friday Irish voters from around the world returned to cast their ballots in Friday's referendum on whether or not to repeal the country's Eighth Amendment. That clause in the Irish constitution in effect outlaws abortion by giving equal rights to the unborn. The #HomeToVote hashtag has trended on Twitter for most of the weekend, as men and women shared their journeys home. From car shares, to offers of beds for the night, the movement was propelled by social media. A similar movement also took off ahead of the 2015 vote that legalised same-sex marriage. People on both sides of the argument travelled back to vote, but the movement was spearheaded by the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign - a pro-choice group that tried to mobilise an estimated 40,000 eligible emigrants. The Eighth Amendment came into being after a 1983 referendum, so no-one under the age of 54 has voted on this before. For many, the vote was touted as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have their say on women's reproductive rights. This video can not be played A warm welcome for people travelling #HometoVote in Dublin Thousands of Irish women travel every year for abortion procedures in Britain. For women who made the reverse trip to vote Yes to repeal the Eighth, the journey held a lot of symbolism. ""I think of it every time I've travelled to and from the UK; it's always on my mind,"" 21-year-old student BlÃ¡ithÃ­n Carroll said before boarding her plane back. BlÃ¡ithÃ­n Carroll says the vote is a chance for Ireland to ""really progress"" as a modern country Karen Fahy, 26, and Maria Mcentee, 24. travelled back from London to vote against the change. They argue that young women opposed to abortion have been stigmatised for their views in the run-up to the referendum and believe many others like them have kept their opinions quiet. What are Ireland's abortion laws? Long read: Ireland's time of reckoning Meet the people on both sides of debate ""A lot of people don't want to get involved in the polarising debates online,"" Maria said. ""But you can kind of infer who is voting no, because they'll be the people who don't have repeal stickers on their picture or post things about repeal."" The 24-year-old said she had always been ""a bit indifferent"" to the abortion issue until she saw a campaign video showing a procedure. Karen Fahy (left) and Maria Mcentee (right) are a part of London-Irish United for Life Currently living in the UK where abortion is legal (except in Northern Ireland), Karen said she had concerns about the proposal presenting abortion as ""the first and only choice"" for women with unplanned pregnancies. ""I don't want to see that coming to Ireland, and I think we can do a lot better,"" she said. ""We should be investing and providing support for women in crisis pregnancies."" ""In those very difficult situations when there's a very severe disability, we should provide more child benefit and support women in education."" Abortion is only currently allowed in Ireland when the woman's life is at risk, and not in cases of rape, incest or foetal-fatal abnormality (FFA). Clara Kumagi, a keen repealer, has taken time off work in Tokyo to travel back thousands of miles to cast her vote. She was already on her way back there by Friday afternoon. ""I want to live in a country where I feel safe, where I know that I have the autonomy to make decisions about my own body,"" the 29-year-old said. Clara says she always knew she wanted to return #HomeToVote to repeal, after being ineligible for the 2015 equal marriage ballot ""For me, the act of travelling was something that I felt was important to do. How many kilometres do Irish women travel every year? For me 10,000km felt like the least I could do."" Her student brother also travelled travelling back from Stockholm to vote. Irish men living as far away as Buenos Aires and Africa have posted online about their journeys home. Pro-repeal men have shared their support for the movement using the #MenForYes hashtag. Rural v urban: Ireland's abortion divide? Mother-of-three Amy Fitzgerald, 38, took three flights to return to Ireland from Prince Edward Island in Canada. Amy's flights were a birthday present bought by husband Padraig, whom she describes as her ""favourite feminist"" ""There's always people who will need an abortion,"" she said, reacting to accusations that the proposed new law could lead to abortion ""on demand"" as a back-up to contraception. The government's proposed abortion bill would allow unrestricted terminations up to 12 weeks, with allowances made afterward on health grounds. ""No-one wants one until you actually need one. No little girl dreams of having one,"" Amy said. Irish actress Lauryn Canny, 19, who travelled back from LA to vote, said that that concern over abortion access loomed over her teenage years. She recalls being ""constantly terrified"" of the risks of having sex while growing up. ""I remember one of my friends said: Well if I got pregnant, I would just commit suicide. I couldn't tell my Mam,"" she says. Lauryn (second left) pictured with her sisters and mother, said every vote would count ""I have two baby sisters now, and they're six and seven, and I just really hope that when they are growing up they feel safer and feel like they're growing up in a more compassionate Ireland that will care for them if they're in crisis."" Lauryn was able to afford flights after her grandmother organised a ""whip-round"" to raise money. Student Sarah Gillespie, 21, travelled back from the US to vote - but for the other side. She felt so strongly about the issue that she cut short her time studying abroad in Pennsylvania to return to Ireland to canvas for a No vote. Physics student Sarah rearranged her flights home to canvas against the repeal She describes herself as a feminist, but believes the rights of the unborn should be considered too. Having previously voted for marriage equality, she wants people to recognise that the issues are different, and that No voters were not simply voting according to strict religious beliefs. ""I would never judge or get angry at a woman who went abroad, I just wish there was better support here,"" Sarah said. She hoped that, whatever the result, people respected the outcome. Unlike in other countries, most eligible voters outside Ireland had to physically travel back to cast their ballot. Only those who have lived away for less than 18 months were legally entitled to take part in the referendum. Because of that rule, Oxford University lecturer Jennifer Cassidy was ineligible to vote - but campaigned for repeal. Those ineligible used the #BeMyYes hashtag to encourage support for Yes. The 31-year-old helped support the motion, alongside a number of Irish students ""I understand it to an extent - Ireland has a huge global community and policing that would be difficult,"" she said. ""But it seems illogical and counter-intuitive to the Irish narrative, which is one of emigrating for a while and then coming home."" Oxford University was one of several UK institutions whose student unions offered to help subsidise travel. Under the current system, people are not routinely removed from Ireland's electoral register, so polling cards were being sent to the family homes of emigrants who were no longer eligible. It was feared that if the result was close, people may have complained about the #HomeToVote movement and whether everyone was actually legal to vote.

"On Friday 25 May, people in the Republic of Ireland voted on whether they want to make changes to the country's strict abortion laws, upheld in the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution. So where does the law currently stand? Since 2013, terminations have been allowed in Ireland but only when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2016, the Irish Department of Health said there were 25 legal abortions carried out in Ireland. In the same year, 3,265 women travelled from Ireland to the UK for a termination. After independence, Ireland retained many UK laws, one of which was the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which criminalised abortion. However, in the early 1980s, following legal cases in other jurisdictions allowing the introduction of less restrictive abortion laws, some people became concerned that something similar could happen in Ireland. This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum In 1983, after a referendum, an eighth amendment was added to the country's constitution known as Article 40.3.3. In it, the state acknowledged ""the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"". After a further referendum in 1992, two other changes were made to the constitution in relation to women seeking to access terminations. The Thirteenth Amendment said women were free to travel to other countries to access abortion services. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that the constitution would not prevent people accessing information relating to ""services lawfully available in another state"". In 2013, the law was changed when the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) voted to allow abortions under limited circumstances. TheProtection of Life During Pregnancy Actallowed terminations to be carried out where there is a threat to the life of the mother. They would also be allowed where there is medical consensus that the expectant mother will take her own life over her pregnancy. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up advise the Irish government on constitutional change,voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitutionwhich strictly limits the availability of abortion. So on 25 May, 2018, the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper read: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies. In March, Health Minister Simon Harris outlined what would be in thegovernment legislation,externalif the people voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. If passed, women could access a termination within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.

"Freeman said making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"" US film star Morgan Freeman has apologised following allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women and several other people. One production assistantaccused Freeman of harassing her for months during filming of bank robbery comedy Going in Style, CNN reported.,external She said the 80-year-old touched her repeatedly, tried to lift her skirt and asked if she was wearing underwear. Freeman apologised to ""anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected"". ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,"" he said in a statement. Making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"", he said. He is the latest well-known Hollywood figure to be accused of sexual misconduct after allegations of sex attacks by producer Harvey Weinstein led to the development of the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? Harvey Weinstein's accusers How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The production assistant was among eight women to tell CNN they had been the victims of harassment. She told CNN that during the harassment another actor, Alan Arkin, ""made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say"". Meanwhile a woman who worked on the 2013 film Now You See Me said staff knew ""not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms"" or any close-fitting clothes if Freeman was around.

"The Bank of England governor has said a ""disorderly"" Brexit could delay rises in interest rates as the Bank would be obliged to act to shore up the economy. Mark Carney made clear what he described as a ""sharp Brexit"" could mean a reassessment of whether an interest rate rise is imminent. And whatever progress is made towards the ""new trading arrangements"" with the EU, weaker income growth ""is likely to accompany that adjustment"". He was speaking at a London conference. Mr Carney said that the negotiations were entering a ""critical phase"" and the Bank was prepared in case the transition was not ""smooth"". Carney: Brexit has cost households Â£900 Carney: Brexit talks could delay rate rises He said the Bank was ""ready for Brexit whatever form it takes"" and suggested that it might be willing to tolerate higher inflation and retain ultra-low interest rates to support growth and jobs. The Governor also said that weak growth in the first three months of the year may not just be down to the harsh weather. Mr Carney said that recent weak growth may not just be due to the harsh weather of February and March Consumer spending statistics were weaker and the housing market was also showing signs of decline, the Governor argued. Many economists believe a weaker economy would also be likely to head off any plans to increase interest rates. The governor also re-iterated the Bank's analysis that the referendum result had damaged the economy. People's incomes had been squeezed and spending had been cut back, he said, leaving households 4% worse off than the Bank expected before the referendum. Businesses were also investing less than expected. ""As the consequences of sterling's fall showed up in the shops and squeezed their real incomes, [consumers] have cut back spending growth to rates about one half of those pre-referendum,"" he said. Mr Carney argued the fall in the value of sterling happened because ""financial markets are valuing today what they expect tomorrow: a relative fall in real incomes as the UK moves toward its new trading arrangements"". ""Inflation rose well above the 2% target, peaking at 3.1% late last year, an overshoot entirely due to the referendum-induced fall in the exchange rate."" His speech comes two days after telling the Treasury Select Committee that households were Â£900 a year worse off due to the referendum. Those comments brought a sharp response from the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, who said that it was ""absolutely not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country"". Mr Carney made clear that the Bank was preparing for all eventualities. ""A sharper Brexit could put monetary policy on a different path,"" the Governor said. ""For example, if the transition were disorderly, or the end state agreement materially worse than the average potential outcome, then the MPC [the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates] could once again be confronted by a trade-off between the speed with which it returns inflation to target and the support policy provides to jobs and activity. ""On this path, the MPC can be expected to set policy to manage any trade-off using the framework it applied following the referendum."" After the referendum result the Bank cut interest rates and increased the amount of financial stimulus it provided to businesses. Senior sources have made clear that while interest rates cuts are not at present on the agenda, the speed with which any interest rate rises are brought in could be slowed if the negotiations with the EU do not progress as hoped. The same sources also said that the Bank was ready for any eventuality and did not believe that a ""sharp Brexit"" was the most likely outcome. Progress via an implementation period was still probable and if it was agreed that could lead to a sharp pick up business confidence, for example. Mr Carney said: ""The MPC has repeatedly emphasised that monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the UK moves to its new trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth likely to accompany that adjustment.""

"McDonald's shareholders have rejected a proposal asking the firm to report on its use of plastic straws, the latest part of a campaign pressing the firm to ban the items. The idea, which was backed by activist group SumOfUs, won less than 8% of the vote at the company's annual meeting. McDonald's had recommended against the measure saying it was ""unnecessary"" and ""redundant"". SumOfUs said the vote was ""not surprising"". SumOfUs has been pressing McDonald's to end its use of plastic straws due to the impact on the environment and wildlife. An online petition on the issue has attracted nearly 500,000 signatures. The proposal, put forward by a small shareholder andpublished in an SEC filing in April,external, argued that McDonald's could face a consumer backlash on environmental grounds. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic It said the company ""has an opportunity to improve its brand by demonstrating leadership in the elimination of plastic straws"". It asked the firm to submit a report on efforts to find alternatives to plastic straws and to assess the business risks associated with continuing to use them. Sondhya Gupta, senior campaigner at SumOfUs, said she has seen McDonald's take steps to address the issue since the campaign started. ""We hope McDonald's will continue to take this issue seriously and we look forward to them reporting back on a timeline for instituting these important reforms,"" she said. There is growing consumer concern about the effects of plastic pollution, in part helped by TV programmes such as the BBC's Blue Planet II. Efforts targeting plastic straws in particular appear to be gaining traction. In the UK, politicians have discussed the idea of a ban, while a growing number of cities in the US, including New York, are taking up the idea. Companies are also taking action on their own. For example, Hilton on Wednesday pledged to eliminate plastic straws from the 650 hotels it manages directly around the world. This video can not be played Woman calls for government to rethink plastic straws policy McDonald's told shareholders that it already has a goal that by 2025, ""all of McDonald's guest packaging (including straws) will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources"". ""The requested report is unnecessary, redundant to our current practices and initiatives, and has the potential for a diversion of resources with no corresponding benefit to the company, our customers, and our shareholders,"" the McDonald's board said. The firm has said it will start phasing out plastic straws in the UK. It is currently testing alternatives in the UK and Belgium. Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK?

"This video can not be played Listen to a clip from the recording that was posted online Boris Johnson has been targeted by a Russian prank caller pretending to be the new prime minister of Armenia. In a recording posted online, the UK foreign secretary congratulates the caller on his election and goes on to discuss UK-Russia relations, the Salisbury poisoning and Syria. He also expresses surprise and interest when the caller claims President Putin is ""influencing"" Jeremy Corbyn. The UK government believes the Kremlin was behind the call. A senior UK diplomatic source said: ""This seems to be the latest desperate attempt by the Kremlin to save face after it was internationally shamed in the wake of the Skripal attack. ""Boris rumbled them pretty quickly and ended the call. ""It is tragic to see a major international power reduced to failed pranks you would usually only see on Trigger Happy TV."" Downing Street said there would be a ""Whitehall investigation"" into how the caller was able to get through to the foreign secretary. ""Obviously this shouldn't have happened. An investigation is under way to determine the circumstances around this call and to make sure that this does not happen again,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said. The 18-minute recording was posted on YouTube by pro-Kremlin British journalist Graham Phillips, BBC Monitoring reports. It was credited to two prominentRussian political pranksters,external- Vladimir ""Vovan"" Kuznetsov and Alexei ""Lexus"" Stolyarov, who are in favour with the official Russian media.

After congratulating the caller, Mr Johnson talks of developing UK-Armenia trade and investment links. Asked about Russia, and the Salisbury poisoning, he says he is ""almost 100% sure"" that Mr Putin was behind the attack and that it is important to avoid a ""new Cold War"". He advises the caller to show ""determination and firmness"" when dealing with Mr Putin. When the man claims the Russian president talked of his ""influence"" over the Labour leader and that his goddaughter ""met with people of Mr Corbyn"", Mr Johnson asks for more information. ""I am sure our intelligence will be listening on this line and they will draw the relevant conclusions,"" he says. During the conversation, the caller also describes what he says is a fake video of the aftermath of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, to which Mr Johnson said it seemed to be ""very clear"" that the Syrian regime was behind a chlorine attack in Douma, ""almost certainly with Russian knowledge"". Mr Johnson also jokes about the number of Russian oligarchs living in London. ""You throw a stone in Kensington and you'll hit an oligarch, some of them are close to Putin and some of them aren't,"" he says. The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson realised the call was a hoax. It added: ""We checked it out and knew immediately it was a prank call. The use of chemical weapons in Salisbury and Syria, and recent events in Armenia are serious matters. ""These childish actions show the lack of seriousness of the caller and those behind him."" In an interview with BBC Moscow, one of the hoaxers, Vladimir Kuznetsov, said they had been surprised at Mr Johnson's ""very diplomatic"" tone in private, compared with his ""flamboyant"" public persona. But he said it was ""comic"" to suggest he immediately knew it was a prank: ""The conversation lasted for 20 minutes. What a silly statement."" Details of the call were published in the pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, with the other hoaxer, Alexei Stolyarov, saying Mr Johnson had turned out to be ""a smart diplomat"".

"Victoria Cilliers almost died in the parachute jump An Army sergeant has been found guilty of trying to murder his wife by tampering with her parachute. Victoria Cilliers, 41, survived the 4,000ft (1,220m) fall at Netheravon airfield in Wiltshire in April 2015. Emile Cilliers was plagued with debt and needed his wife's life insurance money to start a new life with his lover, Winchester Crown Court heard. He was also convicted of trying to kill his wife by causing a gas leak at the family home. The 38-year-old had denied two counts of attempted murder. Mrs Cilliers, a highly-experienced parachuting instructor, suffered near-fatal injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes failed when she took part in a jump at the Army Parachute Association. The trial heard that Cilliers, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps and an experienced parachute packer, tampered with equipment he knew his wife was going to use. Cilliers tampered with his wife's parachute before the jump The jump took place at Netheravon airfield in Wiltshire in April 2015 Lines to the main canopy were twisted and essential parts were missing from the reserve. The court heard the equipment had never failed in this manner anywhere in the world. Sex, lies and payday loans: The parachute murder plot Mrs Cillier's survival was described as a ""near-miracle"", with it put down to the soft soil of the ploughed field where she landed. Her light weight was also attributed as a factor in helping to minimise her injuries. Just days earlier, Cilliers had caused a gas leak at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, by loosening a gas valve fitting in a kitchen cupboard. Jurors heard Cilliers was Â£22,000 in debt and believed he was set to get a Â£120,000 life insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death. This video can not be played Prosecution barrister Hannah Squire said Cilliers was ""cold and calculating"" He needed the money to pay off bills and start a new life with his lover, Stefanie Goller. Cilliers was planning a new life with Ms Goller while also sleeping with his ex-wife Carly Cilliers, and arranging unprotected sex sessions with prostitutes. The extent of his money problems was also revealed in messages sent between the married couple in December 2014 as their relationship began to break down. Det Insp Paul Franklin, of Wiltshire Police, said Cilliers had shown ""nothing but contempt"" for his family. ""On two separate occasions he made serious attempts to murder Victoria - one of these also endangered the lives of his two young children,"" he said. ""His selfish motives were simple - he believed that by killing Victoria his financial problems would be solved, his army career would continue with no danger of Victoria trying to damage it, and he could continue his illicit affair with his girlfriend. ""He has failed to accept any responsibility for his actions which reinforces our view that he is a cold, calculating and callous man whose only duty of care is to himself."" Mr Justice Sweeney said he would be seeking a report from the probation service to establish the ""dangerousness"" of the defendant. ""The burden now falls on me on what to do as far as this defendant is concerned, that too is a heavy burden,"" he said. A date for sentencing has not yet been set. The jury also convicted him of a third count of damaging a gas fitting recklessly endangering life.

"A 28-year-old woman walked away with a fractured skull after managing to fight off a grizzly bear in the US state of Montana. Amber Kornak had just started her dream job researching the fearsome animals when she was mauled by one on a remote mountain range this month. She managed to fend off the creature using Mace-like bear spray, then walked nearly two miles to her vehicle. Ms Kornak is in a stable condition in hospital, a friend said. US aims to ease Alaska bear hunting rules Bear kills Alaska teen during running race Ms Kornak accepted a seasonal position as grizzly bear wildlife technician for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Libby, Montana, on 10 May. Grizzly bears are some of the largest carnivores on Earth On 17 May, while on assignment in the remote Cabinet Mountains, she was attacked by the grizzly, agency spokeswoman Jennifer Strickland said. Ms Kornak was able to reach a canister of bear spray, but accidentally sprayed it on herself before she was able to use it to ward off the animal. The repellant is made from the same ingredient as pepper spray. According to a GoFundMe page set up by her friend, Ms Kornak was able to drive away and find help. She was flown to Kalispell Regional Medical Center, where she received medical treatment for her fractured skull and severe wounds to her head, neck and back. ""She endured 4 gruelling hours of surgery to remove bone fragments and clean wounds to her brain,"" her friend's post on the fundraising page reads. ""Metal plates and screws were placed on her skull and drains were placed in her brain to relieve brain swelling and drain fluid."" The friend, Jenna Hemer,told the New York Daily News,externalMs Kornak was ""passionate about all wildlife, but her dream and her primary focus was to work with grizzly bears"". At the time of the attack, she had been working on a study gathering bear hair to analyse their DNA,the Associated Press reports,external. Ms Kornak was collecting samples near a stream when she was set upon. Wildlife officials believe the noise of running water may have allowed the bear to sneak up on her from behind. On Wednesday, Ms Hemer shared a small note about Ms Kornak's status: ""I have no new updates on her condition other than the fact that she can't wait to eat pizza.""

Last year, Yellowstone National Park removed its protection for grizzlies, though they remain protected elsewhere in the state. The Cabinet Mountains, where Ms Kornak was working, are home to about 50 bears. Earlier this week, the US National Park Service proposed to reverse Obama-era rules against using bait to lure and kill bears in Alaska.

"Items including petrol, a bag of screws and a balaclava were found in an abandoned shed Two teenage boys have been found guilty of plotting a Columbine-style shooting at a school in North Yorkshire. The two boys, both 15, planned to shoot and kill pupils and teachers at the school in Northallerton. A jury heard they were motivated by their ""hero worship"" of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The boys, who were 14 at the time, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder. More stories from across Yorkshire The two boys were found guilty of conspiracy to murder after a trial at Leeds Crown Court The teenagers sat motionless alongside their tearful mothers as the verdicts were delivered. The older of the two boys was also convicted of unlawful wounding after jurors heard he carved his name into his girlfriend's back, but cleared of a count of aggravated burglary. During a trial at Leeds Crown Court lasting three weeks the jury heard the boys had become ""fascinated"" with Harris and Klebold, which was the catalyst for their deadly plot. ""They intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance,"" prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said. ""They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end."" Police searched a number of locations in Northallerton when the teenagers were arrested in November He said petrol and a bag of screws were found in an abandoned shack used as a hideout by the older boy, and they both downloaded a bomb-making manual from the internet. The jury was also shown a conversation between the boys from May 2017, in which one told the other: ""I can't be bothered anymore."" His accomplice replied: ""Why not take some others out as well?"" and added: ""If you're gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school."" The older defendant was also said to have kept a ""kill list"" underneath his bed and a diary in which he discussed his motivations for wanting to carry out an attack. The court heard he described his then girlfriend as ""his Dylan Klebold"" and encouraged her to give him access to her father's shotguns. The older boy wrote in his diary about his desire to carry out an attack The plot was uncovered when the younger boy told a schoolgirl via Snapchat they were planning to carry out a shooting. When she asked if he was joking, he responded: ""No. No one innocent will die. We promise."" He later told a teacher he needed to ""eliminate"" people at the school as they were ""infecting the gene pool"". Neither boy gave evidence during the trial. The judge, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, adjourned the sentencing to a later date. Det Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the boys had shown a ""very real interest in violence"" and a ""desire to act out their fascinations"". He said: ""Disturbingly, they had gone beyond the fantasy and had begun to take very real steps towards making it a reality. ""Whatever their motivation, the intent of the defendants and the direction of their actions, placed others at risk. ""Thankfully, we'll never know if they'd have followed through with their plan.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said a review of the 'gagged worker' case would be undertaken by the Scottish government's permanent secretary First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs she is ""absolutely horrified"" by a photo of a woman allegedly taped to a chair and gagged by male colleagues. Ms Sturgeon said she had asked a top civil servant to conduct a full review into the circumstances and report to her personally as soon as possible. The BBCobtained the photo of DeeAnn Fitzpatrick being restrained. She claims it took place amid years of bullying and harassment at Marine Scotland's Scrabster office. Ms Fitzpatrick, a Canadian national, said the incident happened in 2010 as a result of her blowing the whistle on a threatening and misogynistic culture at the Scottish government department's base on the far north Caithness coast. The fisheries officer has taken her case to an employment tribunal. In evidence to the ongoing tribunal, she claimed that one of the men involved, fellow fisheries officer Reid Anderson, told her: ""This is what you get when you speak out against the boys."" Highlands MSP Rhoda Grant asked the first minister to intervene Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant, who has been supporting 49-year-old Ms Fitzpatrick, asked Ms Sturgeon at First Minister's Questions whether she would now intervene in the case. The first minister said she was limited in what she could say because of an ongoing tribunal and internal investigation. However, she said: ""I can tell the chamber I have this morning asked the permanent secretary of the Scottish government to conduct a full review of the circumstances of this case, a review of the actions already taken and a review of the actions proposed to be taken and to report to me personally on her conclusions as soon as possible."" The Scottish government is responsible for Marine Scotland, which is the watchdog for the fisheries and aquaculture industries in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a full review Ms Sturgeon said: ""Bullying, abuse, sexism, racism, have no place in any work place and they will not be tolerated in the Scottish government or its agencies."" She added: ""I an absolutely horrified at the photo. ""I am also horrified at the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been taken."" Ms Fitzpatrick has been off work sick since November 2016. Top civil servant Leslie Evans will conduct the review She claims that over a period of almost 10 years she was subjected to threatening and misogynistic behaviour. The BBC has seen emails showing Ms Fitzpatrick tried to raise the alleged restraint attack with one of her managers soon after it happened but it appears to have not been taken seriously. The manager said he would have ""a word"" with the men involved - Reid Anderson and Jody Paske. He added: ""I am sure they meant no harm and that was the boys just being boys."" DeeAnn works as a fisheries officer checking the operation of the industry Mr Anderson, who the BBC understands remains employed by Marine Scotland and has recently been promoted, did not respond to the allegations, although civil servants are usually unable to comment without government approval. Mr Paske, who no longer works at Marine Scotland, told the BBC that the allegations were ""lies"". He said: ""These are false allegations. I can't remember the event you mention, but if it did happen, it would have been office banter. Just a craic. Certainly nothing to do with abuse.""

"Freeman said making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"" US film star Morgan Freeman has apologised following allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women and several other people. One production assistantaccused Freeman of harassing her for months during filming of bank robbery comedy Going in Style, CNN reported.,external She said the 80-year-old touched her repeatedly, tried to lift her skirt and asked if she was wearing underwear. Freeman apologised to ""anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected"". ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,"" he said in a statement. Making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"", he said. He is the latest well-known Hollywood figure to be accused of sexual misconduct after allegations of sex attacks by producer Harvey Weinstein led to the development of the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? Harvey Weinstein's accusers How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The production assistant was among eight women to tell CNN they had been the victims of harassment. She told CNN that during the harassment another actor, Alan Arkin, ""made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say"". Meanwhile a woman who worked on the 2013 film Now You See Me said staff knew ""not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms"" or any close-fitting clothes if Freeman was around. Morgan is also said to have stared at women's breasts and asked women to twirl for him. CNN also said it had spoken to dozens more people who worked with or for Mr Freeman, some of whom praised Freeman and insisted his behaviour was always professional.

"What the asteroid strike might have been like The ancestors of modern birds may have survived the asteroid strike that wiped out the rest of their kin by living on the forest floor. The new theory, based on studying fossilised plants and ornithological data, helps explain how birds came to dominate the planet. The asteroid impact 66 million years ago laid waste to the world's forests. Ground-dwelling bird ancestors managed to survive, eventually taking to the trees when the flora recovered. ""It seems clear that being a relatively small-bodied bird capable of surviving in a tree-less world would have conferred a major survival advantage in the aftermath of the asteroid strike,"" said Dr Daniel Field of the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath. We already know that the early ancestors of modern birds were probably capable of flight, and relatively small in size. Scientists have now pieced together their ecology to better understand how these partridge-like bird ancestors managed to avoid destruction in a particularly bleak moment in the Earth's history. ""Teasing these stories from the rock record is a challenge when the action took place over 66 million years ago, over a relatively short period of time,"" said Dr Field, who led a team of UK, US and Swedish researchers. More stories you might like: Seed clue to how birds outlived dinosaurs How birds got their beaks How birds of a feather evolved together The plant fossil record shows that the asteroid caused global deforestation and extinction of most flowering plants, destroying the habitats of tree-dwelling animals. Birds didn't move back into the trees again until the forests recovered thousands of years later. ""The recovery of canopy-forming trees such as palms and pines happened much later, which coincides with the evolution and explosion of diversity of tree-dwelling birds,"" said Dr Antoine Bercovici from Smithsonian Institution. Tinamous resemble partridges and quail but have limited flight capability The researchers found that once the forests had recovered, birds began to adapt to living in trees, acquiring shorter legs than their ground-dwelling ancestors and various specialisations for perching on branches. They eventually diversified into ostriches and their relatives, chickens and their relatives, and ducks and their relatives. ""Perhaps the best modern analogue for one of the surviving birds lineages are modern tinamous - this is a modern group of flying relatives of ostriches: they are relatively small bodied, and live on the ground,"" said Dr Field. Today's ""amazing living bird diversity can be traced to these ancient survivors"", he added. The research is published in the journalCurrent Biology,external. FollowHelen,externalon Twitter.

"Donald Trump called off the upcoming US-North Korea summit on Thursday morning, catching much of official Washington, and the world, by surprise. How he did it - in a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - offers revealing insight at Trump-style diplomacy and what might happen next. The missive from Donald Trump - addressed to ""his excellency"", an unusual title for Mr Kim - begins a bit like a corporate form letter, thanking the North Korean leader for his ""time, patience and effort"". There's a bit of a passive-aggressive dig at Mr Kim - pointing out that he was the one who wanted the meeting, even if that's ""totally irrelevant"" - and an emphasis that this was a ""long-planned meeting"" (the idea was first suggested in March and a date and time set just weeks ago). The real meat of the letter comes at the end of the paragraph, however, as the president's pen turns poison. The North Koreans announced Thursday morning that they had collapsed the tunnels at their nuclear test site, but they accompanied it with threats of nuclear war and a demeaning dig at Vice-President Mike Pence (called ""a political dummy""). Mr Trump has shown time and time again that he won't abide verbal swipes from the North Koreans. He responds to their nuclear sabre-rattling with another round of ""fire and fury"" style language, boasting about the massive and powerful US nuclear arsenal that Donald Trump prays to God will never be used. It's a return to the rhetoric of last summer, when it appeared the US and North Korea were headed toward a military confrontation. The start of the letter may be diplomat-speak, but this is Mr Trump's voice coming through. The letter in full By the second paragraph, the diplomatic gloves are back on. There's an emphasis on the recent thaw between the two nations (a ""wonderful dialogue"") and a hint that the door has not been fully slammed shut."" The president writes that he is still looking forward to meeting the North Korean strongman (nuclear apocalypse notwithstanding). And releasing three American prisoners, one of whom had been sentenced to forced labour in a sham trial, was a much-appreciated ""beautiful gesture"". There will certainly be some critics who question whether this is an appropriate place to turn on the charm. The business letter template kicks in again in the closing paragraph, albeit with somewhat tortured prose. ""If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write"". We have operators standing by! It finishes on a wistful note. In his tweet announcing the time and place of the now-cancelled summit, the president had said the meeting could be a ""very special moment for World Peace"". His supporters broached the idea that he should win a Nobel Prize, which he acknowledged by saying ""everyone thinks so"", adding ""the prize I want is victory for the world"". Instead, it's a ""sad moment in history"".

"Mr Trump has made a number of controversial decisions around complicated global issues recently The decision to pull out of the summit with North Korea rounds off a momentous six weeks for US foreign policy. It has provided a window on President Trump's approach to foreign affairs; one that may worry friends and potential enemies alike. In mid-April there were the US-led strikes on Syria as punishment for the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. Less than a month later, President Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the JCPOA - a deal he had always insisted was bad for the US and bad for its friends in the region. In mid-May he followed through on another campaign promise when the US symbolically moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Now, some 10 days later,he has pulled out of the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. One thing that Mr Trump has certainly demonstrated is his willingness to follow through on commitments he made during the campaign. But both the decision to pull out of the JCPOA and the embassy move in Israel were approached with little real consideration of the wider context or consequences. The Jerusalem embassy decision was made in isolation; it was never seen as part of any broader effort to move ahead with Israel-Palestinian peace. It came at a time of growing tension in the Gaza Strip and, along with heavy-handed Israeli security tactics and the cynicism of the Hamas leadership, it may well have inflamed the violence. Of the Trump administration's much-trumpeted peace plan there is simply no sign. On the Iran deal, there was again no apparent strategic vision. Would this step ultimately make it harder to constrain Iran's nuclear programme? Might it further strain relations with Washington's key Nato allies? And would it not also add an additional level of tension between the US and other key international players like China and Russia? The earlier bombing in Syria was supposed to send a message to President Assad that enough was enough. But again where was the wider strategy? Mr Trump has spoken about wanting to pull all US troops out of Syria, but this seems to fly in the face of another of the administration's stated goals which is to contain and curb Iran's rising influence in Syria and beyond. Will there be a return to the vitriolic exchanges of last year between Kim and Trump? Now we have the decision to pull out of the Singapore summit with North Korea. The problem here was probably a different one; over-optimism and plain lack of experience or realism. North Korea is certainly a difficult country to deal with. Previous administrations have tried to get deals. Twice they have reached agreement and twice they have collapsed. The Americans say that this time they had been reaching out to the North Koreans to discuss the details about what might have been agreed and received little response. Analysing Trump's letter to Kim What does Kim Jong-un really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words It looks as though the summit might have turned into a photo opportunity for Kim Jong-un and that was simply unacceptable in Washington. But this tells us something else about the highly personalised and dysfunctional approach of this administration to foreign affairs. The summit idea emerged almost out of nowhere. It came as a welcome antidote to the growing level of invective between Washington and Pyongyang, as each traded nuclear threats with the other. But it was almost stillborn at birth. The timescale was just far too short. Little preliminary work had been done. The issues were just too complex and the gaps between the two sides seemingly unbridgeable. To even set the summit hare running was a decision that in large part reflected Mr Trump's ego and his bombastic self-belief in his own powers as a deal-maker. But that, it should be clear, is not how diplomacy works. To a large extent, the US foreign policy machine is running in a void. Senior western diplomats point to the almost empty floor at the state department where the essential assistant secretaries for this region or another should be sitting. But they have simply not been appointed yet. This is why the European governments negotiating with the Americans on a follow-on deal for Iran were aghast when they found that their efforts were simply not heading upwards in the US foreign policy machine. Vital pieces of that machinery were simply not in place. The problem of the malaise at the state department and tumbling morale there may well be resolved by the new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But all you can say is better late than never. Already some momentous foreign policy decisions have been made and the US and the world will have to live with the consequences.

"Despite two summits in 2018 and 2019, and then a historic meeting at the Korean border, the future of the US-North Korea talks look bleak. Here's an overview of a saga that has at times threatened nuclear war. The Korean peninsula was divided after World War Two and the North developed an authoritarian form of government. Isolated globally, it saw nuclear weapons as a deterrent against a world it believed was seeking to destroy it. Probably. Pyongyang has carried out six nuclear tests. It claims, though this remains unverified, to have developed a nuclear bombsmall enough for a long-range missile. It also has a ballistic missile experts believe could reach the US, and in 2019 tested a missile that could carry a nuclear weapon and belaunched from a submarine. At the start of 2020, Kim Jong-un ended the country'smoratorium on nuclear testing. After months of escalating mutual threats, in January 2018Mr Kim said he was ""open to dialogue"". Mr Trump accepted, ignoring past pre-talk conditions that North Korea denuclearise first. On 12 June 2018,Mr Trump became the first sitting president to meet a North Korean leader. The two signed an agreement committing to the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" but with no detail on what that meant. Since then, there has been little progress, despite more talks. The US wants North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons while Pyongyang wants a step-by-step approach to ease the crippling sanctions regime. The most recent talks between officials, though not leaders, took place in Sweden in October 2019. The US said ""good discussions were had"" but North Korea said the US""brought nothing to the negotiation table"". Since then, North Korea hascontinued missile testing., while the US has urgedPyongyang to resume talks.

"This video can not be played Listen to a clip from the recording that was posted online Boris Johnson has been targeted by a Russian prank caller pretending to be the new prime minister of Armenia. In a recording posted online, the UK foreign secretary congratulates the caller on his election and goes on to discuss UK-Russia relations, the Salisbury poisoning and Syria. He also expresses surprise and interest when the caller claims President Putin is ""influencing"" Jeremy Corbyn. The UK government believes the Kremlin was behind the call. A senior UK diplomatic source said: ""This seems to be the latest desperate attempt by the Kremlin to save face after it was internationally shamed in the wake of the Skripal attack. ""Boris rumbled them pretty quickly and ended the call. ""It is tragic to see a major international power reduced to failed pranks you would usually only see on Trigger Happy TV."" Downing Street said there would be a ""Whitehall investigation"" into how the caller was able to get through to the foreign secretary. ""Obviously this shouldn't have happened. An investigation is under way to determine the circumstances around this call and to make sure that this does not happen again,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said. The 18-minute recording was posted on YouTube by pro-Kremlin British journalist Graham Phillips, BBC Monitoring reports. It was credited to two prominentRussian political pranksters,external- Vladimir ""Vovan"" Kuznetsov and Alexei ""Lexus"" Stolyarov, who are in favour with the official Russian media.

After congratulating the caller, Mr Johnson talks of developing UK-Armenia trade and investment links. Asked about Russia, and the Salisbury poisoning, he says he is ""almost 100% sure"" that Mr Putin was behind the attack and that it is important to avoid a ""new Cold War"". He advises the caller to show ""determination and firmness"" when dealing with Mr Putin. When the man claims the Russian president talked of his ""influence"" over the Labour leader and that his goddaughter ""met with people of Mr Corbyn"", Mr Johnson asks for more information. ""I am sure our intelligence will be listening on this line and they will draw the relevant conclusions,"" he says. During the conversation, the caller also describes what he says is a fake video of the aftermath of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, to which Mr Johnson said it seemed to be ""very clear"" that the Syrian regime was behind a chlorine attack in Douma, ""almost certainly with Russian knowledge"". Mr Johnson also jokes about the number of Russian oligarchs living in London. ""You throw a stone in Kensington and you'll hit an oligarch, some of them are close to Putin and some of them aren't,"" he says. The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson realised the call was a hoax. It added: ""We checked it out and knew immediately it was a prank call. The use of chemical weapons in Salisbury and Syria, and recent events in Armenia are serious matters. ""These childish actions show the lack of seriousness of the caller and those behind him."" In an interview with BBC Moscow, one of the hoaxers, Vladimir Kuznetsov, said they had been surprised at Mr Johnson's ""very diplomatic"" tone in private, compared with his ""flamboyant"" public persona. But he said it was ""comic"" to suggest he immediately knew it was a prank: ""The conversation lasted for 20 minutes. What a silly statement."" Details of the call were published in the pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, with the other hoaxer, Alexei Stolyarov, saying Mr Johnson had turned out to be ""a smart diplomat"". ""For the first time we spoke with an intellectual, and not a fool,"" he is reported as saying.

Wetake a look at the figures,externalin four charts which show the disparity in incomes depending on where people live across the UK. England had the highest disposable income in the UK in 2016 of Â£19,878. In contrast, Northern Ireland had the lowest disposable income of Â£15,719. England was also the only nation with a disposable income higher than the UK average. But the strongest growth in incomes in 2016, compared to 2015, was in Scotland where incomes rose by 1.2%. In contrast, England saw the slowest growth, with average incomes up by just 0.6% in 2016. Average disposable income increased in all regions last year apart from in the North East and North West, which fell by 0.6% and 0.2% respectively. The largest percentage increase was in the East of England at 1.3%, followed by Scotland at 1.2%. The smallest percentage increase was in the South East at 0.3%, whilst the South West region remained flat. The places with the highest disposable household income in 2016 are still in London and the south East. The top seven places have remained unchanged since 2015, and the top five areas are all in London. Despite having the highest disposable income per head, Kensington & Chelsea and Hammersmith & Fulham showed a decline in growth between 2015 and 2016 of 1.3%. The areas which had the least disposable income in 2016 were all within the north and midland regions of England, except for Derry City and Strabane in Northern Ireland. Nottingham had the lowest disposable income per head in 2016, at 37.1% below the UK average. This was followed by Blackburn with Darwen and Leicester.

""Now maybe nothing happened. I'm not blaming anybody. But I'm just saying maybe nothing happened and maybe it did."" ""But there was a different attitude by the North Korean folks after that meeting."" The editor of China's English-language newspaper the Global Times appears to think so.

However scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable.

Intelligence Committee, has just passed us this statement. He says Trump had no choice but to cancel the meeting, and that it's unfortunate that this comes just after Trump cancelled a nuclear deal with Iran. ""While it is regrettable that we are back to comparing
the size of our nuclear arsenals, the decision to call off the summit was the
necessary result of a poor negotiating strategy in which the President made it
all too clear to North Korea that he needed the summit more than the North
Korean dictator. He says that he hopes for renewed negotiations in the future, but says that Trump has essentially created a double problem for the US today. ""Having created an
increased nuclear threat from Iran with his abandonment of that deal, the last
thing the United States needs is two nuclear problems at the same time."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00064416067
"This video can not be played Couple guilty of murdering French au pair A couple obsessed with an ex-Boyzone singer have been found guilty of murdering their French au pair and burning her body in the garden. Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni were convinced Sophie Lionnet was plotting to abuse people in their home, with the help of singer Mark Walton. They tortured Ms Lionnet before her charred body was found at a house in south-west London on 20 September. At the Old Bailey, the couple admitted burning her body but denied murder. The 'toxic' couple who murdered their au pair Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said he was sure the allegations against Ms Lionnet had ""no truth whatsoever"". He will sentence Medouni, 40, and Kouider, 35, on 26 June. Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni had been in an on-off relationship since meeting in 2001 The court heard the couple applied ""pressure and relentless intimidation"" to get Ms Lionnet to admit Kouider's ex-boyfriend Mr Walton, who was a founding member of Boyzone, had come to the house, and drugged and sexually abused the occupants. Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Ms Lionnet was slapped and called ""worse than a murderer"" by her tormentors. Kouider and Medouni dunked her head into water, starved her, hit with an electrical cable and beat her so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. Hours before her death, a filmed ""confession"" showed an emaciated Ms Lionnet admit she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. Kouider and Medouni starved Sophie Lionnet - pictured here two days before she died Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC told jurors that Kouider and Medouni had an ""unhealthy, myopic, all-consuming and groundless"" obsession with Mr Walton, which deprived them of reason and turned their au pair into ""something less than human"". After killing her in the bath, the couple threw Ms Lionnet on a bonfire in the garden of their home in Southfields as they barbecued chicken nearby. When neighbours alerted firefighters to the pungent-smelling smoke, Medouni said the charred remains were a sheep. The pathologist's findings suggested Ms Lionnet suffered blunt force trauma to the head, neck and chest but the cause of death was unclear due to the burning of her body. Kouider and Medouni had blamed one another for Ms Lionnet's death, each saying they were asleep at the time. The couple dunked Ms Lionnet's head in the bath to make her ""confess"" to allegations she was ""in league"" with Mark Walton In a statement read to the court, Ms Lionnet's mother said her daughter was killed by ""self-obsessed monsters"". Catherine Devallonne added: ""They starved, tortured and broke her until she could no longer fight. They took away her dignity and finally her life. ""Our Sophie will soon be laid to rest. No god will ever forgive you both for what you have done to our daughter."" Nanny murder trial 'stranger than fiction' Boyzone founder 'never heard' of victim Accused killer 'would eat ex-partner raw' Ms Devallonne had paid for a flight for Ms Lionnet to return home to Troyes in France the week after her death, but her ticket was never found. The victim's father Patrick Lionnet said what the couple did to his daughter was ""beyond comprehension"" and ""unforgivable"". ""Sabrina and Ouissem have not only stolen the life of my daughter so brutally and without remorse, they have also stolen mine,"" he added. Mark Walton travelled from America to give evidence during the trial After Kouider and Mr Walton split up, she received a caution for branding him a paedophile on a fake Facebook profile. She reported him to police more than 30 times and also accused him of sexually abusing a cat, using black magic and hiring a helicopter to spy on her. Mr Walton, who travelled from his home in Los Angeles to give evidence during the trial, told jurors that Kouider would ""flip"" during their ""turbulent"" two-year relationship. In a written statement, ex-Blue singer Duncan James also denied claims by Medouni that he had threatened Kouider's landlord with a crowbar. The killers barbecued chicken while burning Sophie Lionnet's body After Thursday's verdicts, Mr Walton said in a statement that he had been affected ""emotionally and professionally"" by the ""tissue of lies"" Kouider had told in a bid to implicate him in the murder. He added that he had given police access to his phones, social media and email accounts to help prove he had ""never met Sophie ever in my life"". Det Insp Domenica Catino said the couple were ""cowardly"" for blaming each other for Ms Lionnet's death. She added: ""They were determined to do whatever it took to get what they wanted and neither one took any steps to help Sophie. It was always about them.""

"A 28-year-old woman walked away with a fractured skull after managing to fight off a grizzly bear in the US state of Montana. Amber Kornak had just started her dream job researching the fearsome animals when she was mauled by one on a remote mountain range this month. She managed to fend off the creature using Mace-like bear spray, then walked nearly two miles to her vehicle. Ms Kornak is in a stable condition in hospital, a friend said. US aims to ease Alaska bear hunting rules Bear kills Alaska teen during running race Ms Kornak accepted a seasonal position as grizzly bear wildlife technician for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Libby, Montana, on 10 May. Grizzly bears are some of the largest carnivores on Earth On 17 May, while on assignment in the remote Cabinet Mountains, she was attacked by the grizzly, agency spokeswoman Jennifer Strickland said. Ms Kornak was able to reach a canister of bear spray, but accidentally sprayed it on herself before she was able to use it to ward off the animal. The repellant is made from the same ingredient as pepper spray. According to a GoFundMe page set up by her friend, Ms Kornak was able to drive away and find help. She was flown to Kalispell Regional Medical Center, where she received medical treatment for her fractured skull and severe wounds to her head, neck and back. ""She endured 4 gruelling hours of surgery to remove bone fragments and clean wounds to her brain,"" her friend's post on the fundraising page reads. ""Metal plates and screws were placed on her skull and drains were placed in her brain to relieve brain swelling and drain fluid."" The friend, Jenna Hemer,told the New York Daily News,externalMs Kornak was ""passionate about all wildlife, but her dream and her primary focus was to work with grizzly bears"". At the time of the attack, she had been working on a study gathering bear hair to analyse their DNA,the Associated Press reports,external. Ms Kornak was collecting samples near a stream when she was set upon. Wildlife officials believe the noise of running water may have allowed the bear to sneak up on her from behind. On Wednesday, Ms Hemer shared a small note about Ms Kornak's status: ""I have no new updates on her condition other than the fact that she can't wait to eat pizza.""

Last year, Yellowstone National Park removed its protection for grizzlies, though they remain protected elsewhere in the state.

Earlier this week, the US National Park Service proposed to reverse Obama-era rules against using bait to lure and kill bears in Alaska.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri site before the detonations North Korea appears to have blown up tunnels at its only nuclear test site, in a move to reduce regional tensions. Foreign reporters at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east said they had witnessed a huge blast. Pyongyang later said the site had been dismantled. The move by the North was seen as part of a diplomatic rapprochement with South Korea and the US. But scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable. It came ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June, which has now been cancelled by Mr Trump. Independent inspectors were not allowed to witness the process of the dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in the mountainous region of the country, and some worry it could be easily reversible, the BBC's Laura Bicker reports. What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? North Korea crisis in 300 words What not to say to North Korea Three tunnels were collapsed in a series of explosions in front of about 20 handpicked international journalists. Two blasts were reportedly carried out in the morning, and four in the afternoon. Tom Cheshire of Sky News was among the journalists present. He said the doors to the tunnels were ""theatrically rigged"" with ""wires everywhere"". ""We hiked up into the mountains and watched the detonation from about 500 metres [550 yards] away,"" he said. ""They counted it down: three, two, one. There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud."" North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Institute later said in a statement that the dismantling of the site ""was done in such a way as to make all the tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion and completely close the tunnel entrances"", NK News website says. ""It has been confirmed that there were neither leakage of radioactive materials nor any adverse impact on the surrounding ecological environment."" The South Korean government welcomed the news. ""[We] expect it to serve as a chance for complete denuclearisation going forward,"" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency. Analysis by Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director, International Institute for Strategic Studies-Americas Destruction of the nuclear testing tunnels at Punggye-ri is a demonstrable, tangible step toward the denuclearisation goal that leader Kim Jong-un agreed to at the 27 April Panmunjom Summit. However, North Korea should have allowed experts from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization to observe the tunnel collapse. Not doing so signalled disinterest in verification standards that will be required for any denuclearisation agreement with the US. This harks back to the situation in mid-2008, when, with cameras rolling, North Korea destroyed the cooling tower of its plutonium-production reactor in Yongbyon, but a few months later refused to accept verification requirements to prove that its declaration of plutonium production was complete and correct. Negotiations collapsed and North Korea went on to re-use the reactor after installing a different cooling system. Similarly, North Korea could easily construct new tunnels to resume nuclear testing. Still, the collapse of three existing tunnels, two of which appeared to still be operable, is a welcome first move. It will undoubtedly want something in exchange before it takes more steps. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap. It is thought to have been the North's main nuclear facility and until now the only active nuclear testing site in the world. It is located about 370km (230 miles) north-east of Pyongyang. Test devices are buried deep at the end of the tunnels, which end in a hook. The tunnel gets backfilled to prevent radioactive leakage and then the device is detonated. Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Pyongyang's reported dismantling of the site is seen by analysts as a first step. But it could indicate that it believes its nuclear programme has made sufficient progress and full testing is no longer needed, Catherine Dill from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) says. She says North Korea's nuclear weapons programme also goes far beyond the existence of one site. This video can not be played Viewpoint: Why Trump's summit strategy was so unusual Satellite imagery will be used by governments and independent experts to monitor for activity, new buildings and equipment, which might indicate that North Korea plans to resume testing. Satellite imagery may not help if North Korea clandestinely opens a new nuclear test site, Ms Dill says, as it has many other mountains that could be used. But if that were the case, it would be unable to hide any new underground tests, as the resulting seismic tremors would be detected. Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme Earlier on Thursday - ahead of the cancelled of the planned US-North Korea summit - North Korean official Choe Son-hui dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"". Ms Choe, who has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade, said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. Mike Pence is a ""political dummy"", says North Korea Her comments came after Mr Pence warned that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - where then-leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after renouncing nuclear weapons eight years earlier.

"This video can not be played The attack on the family's house in Salford was captured on CCTV Two men who murdered four children by torching their home with petrol bombs have been given life sentences. Zak Bolland, 23, and David Worrall, 26, were convicted of murdering Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson in Walkden, Salford in December. Courtney Brierley, 20, was cleared of their murders but found guilty of four counts of manslaughter following the blaze. Bolland was jailed for a minimum of 40 years and Worrall for 37 years. A judge at Manchester Crown Court also sentenced Brierley to 21 years in a young offenders institution. Mr Justice William Davis said the four children ""died a terrible death"". Sandra Lever, the children's grandmother, said the offenders were ""evil"". ""To think and do anything like this with four babies in the house, and a woman, and two other children, it's just beyond me."" Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma The jury heard Bolland, who lived 300 yards from the Pearsons, was high on drink and drugs when he launched the fatal attack, which was motivated by a petty feud with the victims' 17-year-old brother Kyle Pearson. Along with Worrall, he filled two glass bottles with Â£1.50 of petrol bought from a local garage, stuffing the tops with tissue paper as they prepared the attack shortly before 05:00 GMT. They removed a fence panel from the garden of the family's home in Jackson Street, smashed a kitchen window and threw in the two lit petrol bombs. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Zak Bolland (left) and David Worrall were found guilty of the murders of four siblings Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, all died in the blaze. Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 36, was rescued, severely injured, along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Neighbour Karen Kormoss told the jury during the murder trial Mrs Pearson screamed ""not the kids"" as the flames took hold. She said she saw the windows blown out and flames coming from upstairs and downstairs within two minutes. Bolland and Worrall threw two lit petrol bombs at the family's home Mrs Pearson dialled 999 but she was overcome with heat and smoke before completing the call. She spent four months in a coma and still suffers with dreadful burns and has had several infections. She has been told about the deaths of her children but ""it's questionable how much she's absorbed and is aware of what she's been told"", the court heard. Bolland was found guilty of three counts of the attempted murder of Mrs Pearson, Kyle, and his friend Bobby Harris who was staying at their house. Worrall, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Bolland's then-girlfriend Courtney Brierley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter Worrall and Brierley broke down in tears as the verdicts were read out in court. Bolland blinked and looked down to the floor. The court heard Bolland was friends with Kyle until the defendant's car was set on fire and his house windows smashed and he blamed the teenager. Mrs Pearson had called police on at least five occasions in the two weeks before her children died, saying Bolland was threatening to use fire to harm her family. He set their wheelie bin on fire two days before the fatal fire and threatened to ""kill 'em all"" four hours before he torched the house, the court heard. CCTV shown to the jury showed Bolland and Worrall at the address at 04:55 for one minute and five seconds. The cameras recorded a flash then a larger second one from the petrol bombs, before they fled. Bolland, who admitted throwing the second petrol bomb but denied all other charges said he intended only to damage the house which he thought was not occupied. ""I heard like a big whoosh. I didn't look back,"" he told the jury. Zak Bolland lived 300 yards from the Pearsons Worrall, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, said he thought they were only going to set fire to wheelie bins and denied throwing a petrol bomb. Brierley, from Walkden, said she did not know the two men had petrol bombs and claims Bolland had a ""controlling influence"" over her during their ""toxic"" relationship. Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said it was one of the ""most heartbreaking cases"" he had ever dealt with. ""I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children,"" he said.

However scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable. Independent inspectors were not allowed to witness the process of the dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in the mountainous region of the country, and some worry it could be easily reversible, the BBC's Laura Bicker reports.

The note begins by thanking Kim for his 'time and patience', then the president's pen turns poison. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has urged the US and North Korean leaders to hold direct talks, Yonhap news agency reports. He said the denculearisation of the Korean should not be delayed. ""Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,"" the president said in an emergency meeting with his top security officials at his office. Vipin Narang, a professor of political science at MIT in Massachussetts, has given his take on the day's events. He says North Korea and China are the winners in this situation, and the US, Japan and ""pretty much everyone else"" are the losers. That's because, he says, North Korea gets to keep its nuclear weapons and ""baited"" the US into pulling out of talks, making it look like the ""bad guy"". Allow Twitter content?

Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who serves as the top Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee, has just passed us this statement. He says Trump had no choice but to cancel the meeting, and that it's unfortunate that this comes just after Trump cancelled a nuclear deal with Iran. ""While it is regrettable that we are back to comparing
the size of our nuclear arsenals, the decision to call off the summit was the
necessary result of a poor negotiating strategy in which the President made it
all too clear to North Korea that he needed the summit more than the North
Korean dictator. He says that he hopes for renewed negotiations in the future, but says that Trump has essentially created a double problem for the US today. ""Having created an
increased nuclear threat from Iran with his abandonment of that deal, the last
thing the United States needs is two nuclear problems at the same time."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9973162
"A woman and her child are the main characters in the TV advert Britain's secret service will air its first recruitment advert on national TV later in a bid to encourage more women and ethnic minorities to join MI6. The intelligence officers would help find new secret agents and check information gathered is legitimate. The poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury resulted in a surge of applications, officials say. But they want to broaden their reach, and say they want people who ""challenge the status quo"". The latest official figures from March 2016 showed 24.1% of senior staff and 37.8% of non-senior staff were women. There were also no British, Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) members among the senior ranks and they accounted for just 6.8% of the non-senior staff. The advert, which will be shown in a break during Channel 4 News at around 19:30 BST, begins with an image of a shark - stereotypically a depiction of ""evil"" in James Bond films. But later it turns to a mother comforting a child and tells viewers MI6 wants people who have understanding and emotional skills. ""Secretly, we're just like you"" is the tagline of the campaign. MI6 wants people who can pick up on ""the silent cues that matter"" MI6 has long had a deeply ambivalent relationship with its fictional portrayal in the James Bond films. Last year,the Secret Intelligence Service broadcast adverts at the cinemato attract a different type of candidate. The image of a ruthless spy with a licence to kill who saves the world has done wonders for the MI6 brand, but it does not reflect the reality of work inside the organisation and the concern is that it may have put some people off joining. I wish mum's phone was never invented Saudi women's rights crackdown widens Forgetful couple find 'lost' parked car Chief of the service, Alex Younger, said MI6 needs to have the diverse workforce ""to meet the challenges we face"" and avoid having a groupthink approach. ""We want people who have never thought of joining MI6 to join MI6"", he says. ""People who challenge the status quo - in a respectful way - are valued,"" he added. The average starting salary is around Â£35,000 to Â£37,000 for the intelligence officer positions and all applicants must pass a vetting process. James Bond doesn't really reflect the work MI6 does, officials say Intelligence officers perform three different functions. Targeters identify individuals who may have access to secret information who MI6 might be able to recruit as agents. Case officers cultivate, build and manage the relationships with those agents. ""R"" or requirements officers make sure the intelligence that is produced by agents is valid and also relevant to the customers in government who receive it. This latter function was boosted in the aftermath of MI6's performance over Iraq's weapons of mass destruction when erroneous intelligence was used to justify military action. Previously, applicants would have had to prove their parents had been born in the UK, but this requirement is now being looked at. ""We are making our nationality rules slightly more flexible, to support our diversity agenda and enable a wider selection of candidates to join us,"" a recruitment official for MI6 said.

"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri site before the detonations North Korea appears to have blown up tunnels at its only nuclear test site, in a move to reduce regional tensions. Foreign reporters at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east said they had witnessed a huge blast. Pyongyang later said the site had been dismantled. The move by the North was seen as part of a diplomatic rapprochement with South Korea and the US. But scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017, rendering it unusable. It came ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June, which has now been cancelled by Mr Trump. Independent inspectors were not allowed to witness the process of the dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in the mountainous region of the country, and some worry it could be easily reversible, the BBC's Laura Bicker reports. What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? North Korea crisis in 300 words What not to say to North Korea Three tunnels were collapsed in a series of explosions in front of about 20 handpicked international journalists. Two blasts were reportedly carried out in the morning, and four in the afternoon. Tom Cheshire of Sky News was among the journalists present. He said the doors to the tunnels were ""theatrically rigged"" with ""wires everywhere"". ""We hiked up into the mountains and watched the detonation from about 500 metres [550 yards] away,"" he said. ""They counted it down: three, two, one. There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud."" North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Institute later said in a statement that the dismantling of the site ""was done in such a way as to make all the tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion and completely close the tunnel entrances"", NK News website says. ""It has been confirmed that there were neither leakage of radioactive materials nor any adverse impact on the surrounding ecological environment."" The South Korean government welcomed the news. ""[We] expect it to serve as a chance for complete denuclearisation going forward,"" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency. Analysis by Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director, International Institute for Strategic Studies-Americas Destruction of the nuclear testing tunnels at Punggye-ri is a demonstrable, tangible step toward the denuclearisation goal that leader Kim Jong-un agreed to at the 27 April Panmunjom Summit. However, North Korea should have allowed experts from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization to observe the tunnel collapse. Not doing so signalled disinterest in verification standards that will be required for any denuclearisation agreement with the US. This harks back to the situation in mid-2008, when, with cameras rolling, North Korea destroyed the cooling tower of its plutonium-production reactor in Yongbyon, but a few months later refused to accept verification requirements to prove that its declaration of plutonium production was complete and correct. Negotiations collapsed and North Korea went on to re-use the reactor after installing a different cooling system. Similarly, North Korea could easily construct new tunnels to resume nuclear testing. Still, the collapse of three existing tunnels, two of which appeared to still be operable, is a welcome first move. It will undoubtedly want something in exchange before it takes more steps. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap. It is thought to have been the North's main nuclear facility and until now the only active nuclear testing site in the world. It is located about 370km (230 miles) north-east of Pyongyang. Test devices are buried deep at the end of the tunnels, which end in a hook. The tunnel gets backfilled to prevent radioactive leakage and then the device is detonated. Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Pyongyang's reported dismantling of the site is seen by analysts as a first step. But it could indicate that it believes its nuclear programme has made sufficient progress and full testing is no longer needed, Catherine Dill from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) says. She says North Korea's nuclear weapons programme also goes far beyond the existence of one site. This video can not be played Viewpoint: Why Trump's summit strategy was so unusual Satellite imagery will be used by governments and independent experts to monitor for activity, new buildings and equipment, which might indicate that North Korea plans to resume testing. Satellite imagery may not help if North Korea clandestinely opens a new nuclear test site, Ms Dill says, as it has many other mountains that could be used. But if that were the case, it would be unable to hide any new underground tests, as the resulting seismic tremors would be detected. Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme Earlier on Thursday - ahead of the cancelled of the planned US-North Korea summit - North Korean official Choe Son-hui dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"". Ms Choe, who has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade, said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. Mike Pence is a ""political dummy"", says North Korea Her comments came after Mr Pence warned that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - where then-leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after renouncing nuclear weapons eight years earlier.

"This video can not be played The attack on the family's house in Salford was captured on CCTV Two men who murdered four children by torching their home with petrol bombs have been given life sentences. Zak Bolland, 23, and David Worrall, 26, were convicted of murdering Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson in Walkden, Salford in December. Courtney Brierley, 20, was cleared of their murders but found guilty of four counts of manslaughter following the blaze. Bolland was jailed for a minimum of 40 years and Worrall for 37 years. A judge at Manchester Crown Court also sentenced Brierley to 21 years in a young offenders institution. Mr Justice William Davis said the four children ""died a terrible death"". Sandra Lever, the children's grandmother, said the offenders were ""evil"". ""To think and do anything like this with four babies in the house, and a woman, and two other children, it's just beyond me."" Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma The jury heard Bolland, who lived 300 yards from the Pearsons, was high on drink and drugs when he launched the fatal attack, which was motivated by a petty feud with the victims' 17-year-old brother Kyle Pearson. Along with Worrall, he filled two glass bottles with Â£1.50 of petrol bought from a local garage, stuffing the tops with tissue paper as they prepared the attack shortly before 05:00 GMT. They removed a fence panel from the garden of the family's home in Jackson Street, smashed a kitchen window and threw in the two lit petrol bombs. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Zak Bolland (left) and David Worrall were found guilty of the murders of four siblings Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, all died in the blaze. Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 36, was rescued, severely injured, along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Neighbour Karen Kormoss told the jury during the murder trial Mrs Pearson screamed ""not the kids"" as the flames took hold. She said she saw the windows blown out and flames coming from upstairs and downstairs within two minutes. Bolland and Worrall threw two lit petrol bombs at the family's home Mrs Pearson dialled 999 but she was overcome with heat and smoke before completing the call. She spent four months in a coma and still suffers with dreadful burns and has had several infections. She has been told about the deaths of her children but ""it's questionable how much she's absorbed and is aware of what she's been told"", the court heard. Bolland was found guilty of three counts of the attempted murder of Mrs Pearson, Kyle, and his friend Bobby Harris who was staying at their house. Worrall, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Bolland's then-girlfriend Courtney Brierley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter Worrall and Brierley broke down in tears as the verdicts were read out in court. Bolland blinked and looked down to the floor. The court heard Bolland was friends with Kyle until the defendant's car was set on fire and his house windows smashed and he blamed the teenager. Mrs Pearson had called police on at least five occasions in the two weeks before her children died, saying Bolland was threatening to use fire to harm her family. He set their wheelie bin on fire two days before the fatal fire and threatened to ""kill 'em all"" four hours before he torched the house, the court heard. CCTV shown to the jury showed Bolland and Worrall at the address at 04:55 for one minute and five seconds. The cameras recorded a flash then a larger second one from the petrol bombs, before they fled. Bolland, who admitted throwing the second petrol bomb but denied all other charges said he intended only to damage the house which he thought was not occupied. ""I heard like a big whoosh. I didn't look back,"" he told the jury. Zak Bolland lived 300 yards from the Pearsons Worrall, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, said he thought they were only going to set fire to wheelie bins and denied throwing a petrol bomb. Brierley, from Walkden, said she did not know the two men had petrol bombs and claims Bolland had a ""controlling influence"" over her during their ""toxic"" relationship. Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said it was one of the ""most heartbreaking cases"" he had ever dealt with. ""I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children,"" he said.

"The Hwasong-18 missile uses solid fuel North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet President Putin this month about potentially providing Moscow with weapons for its war in Ukraine, according to a US official. There are concerns that in return, North Korea may seek advanced weapons technology from Russia. North Korea has continued regular tests of its missiles this year, after a significant increase in tests carried out in 2022. North Korea has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years. It's also tested hypersonic missiles, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude to escape radar detection, as well as others launched from submarines. In April, North Korea tested what it called ""its most powerful"" missile to date - the Hwasong-18. It's a solid-fuel missile, which are generally quicker to launch than liquid-fuel ones. It reportedly flew about 1,000km on its maiden flight, but its true range is estimated to be in excess of 15,000km, according to the US-based CSIS Missile Defense Project. A second test launch in July 2023 saw a Hwasong-18 reach a claimed altitude of over 6,600km, with a flight time of 74 minutes. In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missilewas tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government. Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it. The missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one. Several earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, althoughit may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.,external In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range. North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York. And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in 2022, including ones capable of reaching US territory. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or ""yield"", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device- the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon. However, North Korea may be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. ""It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles"" he says. North Korea says it simulated nuclear strike on South Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea saidit would shut the site down, because it had ""verified"" its nuclear capabilities. Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use. In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trumpthat North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities. However, the UN's atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea has restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium. In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a test site at Punggye-ri was open again.  And in March this year, Mr Grossi said that activity thereas well as at Yongbyon was ""deeply regrettable."",external The IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea's nuclear facilities since April 2009.

"Sophie Lionnet moved to London from her home in north-east France in January 2016 A couple who tortured their French au pair before burning her body in their garden have been convicted of her murder. Why did Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni kill 21-year-old Sophie Lionnet? As a motive for murder, it is bizarre beyond belief. Kouider, 35, suspected her former boyfriend Mark Walton, a founding member of the Irish pop group Boyzone, was having an affair with her young au pair. The Old Bailey heard how she and 40-year-old Medouni applied ""pressure and relentless intimidation"" on Miss Lionnet to admit being in a sexual relationship with Mr Walton. They insisted their young au pair had helped him come to the couple's home in the London suburb of Southfields to drug and sexually abuse the occupants. Hours of footage recorded by Kouider and Medouni over several months showed a terrified Miss Lionnet also being accused of being a paedophile and a spy. Threatened with rape, prison and more violence, she eventually made a confession to having an affair with Mr Walton - a man who told the couple's trial that she'd never even met. Soon after she was dead. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider had been in an on-off relationship since meeting in 2001 Miss Lionnet, from Troyes in north-east France, had moved to the UK in January 2016 in order to improve her English. ""She was a pearl. Kind, gentle. She loved everyone, she loved making people happy,"" her aunt said, speaking about her niece at a march held a month after Miss Lionnet's death. During the au pair's employment by the couple, she became known to various people in the Southfields community. Local restaurant owner Michael Cromer, who had been in talks with Kouider and Medouni to go into business together, said Miss Lionnet would join them when they went to meet him. Miss Lionnet's mother Catherine Devallonne and stepfather Stephane Devallonne have attended much of the trial She would sometimes also visit his fish and chip restaurant alone. ""She was always very quiet. She didn't want to communicate much,"" Mr Cromer said. The business owner could sense the au pair was struggling but never imagined what was happening at the couple's home. ""Her body language showed there was something wrong... there were times when she had tears in her eyes so I asked her why and she said her mum was not well. ""Once she said Sabrina beat her... I asked why, and she said she had dropped the butter."" Michael Cromer said he never saw anything amiss when he visited the couple's home In reality, the abuse had been going on for some time. The videos of the couple's interrogations of her showed the 21-year-old becoming thinner over the months. It was only after it was too late that the alarm would be raised, albeit inadvertently, by neighbours who called 999 over a foul-smelling fire in the garden. Thomas Hunt, one of the first firefighters on the scene, soon realised a body had been burnt when he spotted a nose and fingers in the remnants of the fire, as well as clothes and jewellery. Nanny murder trial 'stranger than fiction' Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Blue singer Duncan James denies crowbar claim Boyzone founder 'never heard' of French nanny He told the jury that when he turned to Medouni, the defendant told him it was the carcass of a sheep. Miss Lionnet's body was so badly burnt the exact cause of her death has never been established, although post-mortem tests showed she had suffered fractures to her sternum, four ribs and her jawbone in the days before her death in September of last year. In court, the couple blamed each other for the violence suffered by their au pair. Summing up the prosecution's case, Richard Howell QC described the ""odd couple"" as a ""truly toxic combination"". The court heard fashion designer Kouider was ""obsessed"" with her former partner Mark Walton Faced with such torment, why did the 21-year-old not abandon the couple's home on Wimbledon Park Road? Ruth Bowskill, a chief prosecutor at the CPS, said Miss Lionnet had wanted to leave and had written to her family in France telling them this. However, she believes Kouider and Medouni manipulated the ""particularly shy"" au pair, who knew little English, gaining control over her. ""Given the intimidation, the bullying and the behaviour towards her... it's likely that she didn't feel able to leave,"" Ms Bowskill said. Investigators also never found the au pair's passport and a plane ticket her mother had bought her to return to France and believe the couple may have confiscated them. A thin-looking Miss Lionnet was filmed during a visit to a boxing gym in London a year before her death The court was told about Kouider's erratic behaviour, including during her two-year relationship with Mr Walton. She was accused of making up ""dreadful stories about people, often of a sexual nature"" and picking on those she saw as ""weak"". The jury heard on one occasion she called police and accused Mr Walton of sexually abusing her cat - even though she did not have one. She also accused him and his friends of flying helicopters over her home. The court was told that in May 2017 Kouider was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder. Sunil Patel said he experienced Kouider's ""volatile"" side when she visited his shop While they would never have believed Kouider was capable of murder, some within the community had experienced how volatile the fashion designer could be. ""Sabrina was quirky, she had a bit of a temper,"" said Sunil Patel, who runs the local newsagent. Mr Patel was aware of Kouider's fixation with Mr Walton. ""She was obsessed with this guy... she said 'have you seen this person', and she showed me this photo of a blond-haired man on her phone."" The couple denied murder, but admitted burning Miss Lionnet's body in the garden of their home Mr Patel said that when he asked what had happened, she explained that he was ""a very dangerous person"" who had hurt her family. ""I said 'why didn't your nanny say anything about it?', and she said the nanny was complicit."" Mr Patel said although he thought Kouider's behaviour was ""weird"" he never imagined that her au pair, who also regularly visited the shop, was in any danger. Sadly, he was wrong. Speaking in October, Miss Lionnet's aunt described Kouider and Medouni as ""utterly contemptible"". ""I hope they pay a very high price.""

"Sophie Lionnet's body was found on a bonfire in her employers' garden in September 2017 The trial over the alleged torture and murder of a nanny by her employers is ""stranger than fiction"", a jury heard. Prosecutor Richard Howell QC told the Old Bailey Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni treated French national Sophie Lionnet as ""less than human"". The couple blame each other for killing Ms Lionnet, whose body was burnt in the garden of their Wimbledon flat. The pair admit perverting the course of justice by disposing of the 21-year-old's body but deny murder. In his summing up speech, Mr Howell said the accused were driven by a ""preposterous"" obsession with Ms Kouider's ex-boyfriend, and former Boyzone pop star, Mark Walton. Boyzone founder 'never heard' of French nanny Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Blue's Duncan James denies crowbar claim at murder trial Sophie Lionnet murder accused 'claimed Donald Trump connection' ""Of all the cases this historic building has heard, this must without hesitation enter the category of the more bizarre,"" Mr Howell said. ""Expressions such as 'you really could not make it up' and 'truth is stranger than fiction' come readily to mind. ""The defendants made a truly odd couple. There is a unique bond between them that has kept them together on and off for many years, a bond based partly in love and something close to it. ""But, as far as this trial is concerned, the point that really matters is that together they were a truly toxic combination."" Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder but admit perverting the course of justice During the trial, Ms Kouider, 35, and Mr Medouni, 40, were accused of torturing Ms Lionnet in the lead-up to her death. Mr Horwell said they regarded ""submissive"" Miss Lionnet as ""expendable"" and killed her out of ""revenge and punishment"". Mr Walton, a founder member of Boyzone, was praised by Mr Horwell for his ""integrity and honesty"" in giving evidence to the court. He added: ""Walton is a wealthy man - and good luck to him for that - but it is of course a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune will often be parted from it.""

"The court heard Sophie Lionnet's body showed signs of ""significant violence"" A couple accused of killing a French nanny put her under ""relentless"" pressure to admit claims that a former Boyzone member had drugged and sexually abused occupants of their home. Sophie Lionnet, 21, was allegedly murdered and thrown on a bonfire by her employers Sabrina Kouider and partner Ouissem Medouni last September. They accused Ms Lionnet of being ""in league"" with Ms Kouider's ex and founding Boyzone member Mark Walton. Both defendants deny murder. Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC told the Old Bailey the couple applied ""pressure and relentless intimidation"" to get her to admit Mr Walton had come to the house, and drugged and sexually abused the occupants with the help of an accomplice. Mr Horwell told the court the defendants interrogated Miss Lionnet for hours about their ""perverted suspicions"" involving Ms Kouider's ex-partner. Jurors were shown ""harrowing"" video footage of an emaciated Miss Lionnet making an apparent confession naming Mark Walton. Mr Horwell: ""You will have seen the state of Sophie when she uttered the words that can be heard on that video clip and whatever may be said about that final confession it is anything but voluntary. ""Sophie had been subjected to violence and a relentless inquisition. Those are her very last words. Within hours, Sophie's life was taken from her."" He suggested one motive for killing her was ""punishment and revenge"". Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder Mr Medouni also had a ""prurient interest"" in whether Miss Lionnet was having sex with Los Angeles-based Mr Walton, jurors heard. Ms Kouider, 35, and Mr Medouni, 40, deny murdering her at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London. Her body was found on a bonfire in the couple's back garden. Sophie Lionnet's body was found after neighbours raised concerns about a fire in a back garden Mr Horwell played snippets of more than eight hours of mobile phone recordings made by the defendants. In extracts made in the weeks before Miss Lionnet's death, designer Kouider accused Miss Lionnet of being a paedophile and a spy and later said she could ""smell sex"" on her. Miss Lionnet was almost inaudible as she denied it, telling the defendants she was ""scared"". Her mother wept and fled the court as Ms Kouider was heard shouting at her daughter in a mixture of French and English. In a recording on 11 September, Ms Kouider screamed: ""You destroy everything. I was trying to find myself again. ""I pray to god not to make me touch you. I don't want to make my hands dirty."" The following day, the defendants accused Miss Lionnet of helping a ""devil"".

"Items including petrol, a bag of screws and a balaclava were found in an abandoned shed Two teenage boys have been found guilty of plotting a Columbine-style shooting at a school in North Yorkshire. The two boys, both 15, planned to shoot and kill pupils and teachers at the school in Northallerton. A jury heard they were motivated by their ""hero worship"" of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The boys, who were 14 at the time, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder. More stories from across Yorkshire The two boys were found guilty of conspiracy to murder after a trial at Leeds Crown Court The teenagers sat motionless alongside their tearful mothers as the verdicts were delivered. The older of the two boys was also convicted of unlawful wounding after jurors heard he carved his name into his girlfriend's back, but cleared of a count of aggravated burglary. During a trial at Leeds Crown Court lasting three weeks the jury heard the boys had become ""fascinated"" with Harris and Klebold, which was the catalyst for their deadly plot. ""They intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance,"" prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said. ""They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end."" Police searched a number of locations in Northallerton when the teenagers were arrested in November He said petrol and a bag of screws were found in an abandoned shack used as a hideout by the older boy, and they both downloaded a bomb-making manual from the internet. The jury was also shown a conversation between the boys from May 2017, in which one told the other: ""I can't be bothered anymore."" His accomplice replied: ""Why not take some others out as well?"" and added: ""If you're gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school."" The older defendant was also said to have kept a ""kill list"" underneath his bed and a diary in which he discussed his motivations for wanting to carry out an attack. The court heard he described his then girlfriend as ""his Dylan Klebold"" and encouraged her to give him access to her father's shotguns. The older boy wrote in his diary about his desire to carry out an attack The plot was uncovered when the younger boy told a schoolgirl via Snapchat they were planning to carry out a shooting. When she asked if he was joking, he responded: ""No. No one innocent will die. We promise."" He later told a teacher he needed to ""eliminate"" people at the school as they were ""infecting the gene pool"". Neither boy gave evidence during the trial. The judge, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, adjourned the sentencing to a later date. Det Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the boys had shown a ""very real interest in violence"" and a ""desire to act out their fascinations"". He said: ""Disturbingly, they had gone beyond the fantasy and had begun to take very real steps towards making it a reality. ""Whatever their motivation, the intent of the defendants and the direction of their actions, placed others at risk. ""Thankfully, we'll never know if they'd have followed through with their plan.""

"This video can not be played Investigators said in 2018 they had evidence of the route taken by a Russian missile convoy The missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade, international investigators say. For the first time, the Dutch-led team said the missile had come from a unit based in western Russia. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It was hit by a missile fired from rebel-held territory in Ukraine. Russia says none of its weapons was used. But on Thursday Wilbert Paulissen, a Dutch official from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), told reporters: ""All the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces."" He restated the JIT's conclusion that the plane had been destroyed by a Russian-made Buk missile, adding that it had been supplied by the country's 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk. At a news conference in the Dutch city of Utrecht, the investigators also showed social media pictures which they said traced the route the missile convoy had taken to reach eastern Ukraine. The incident occurred at the height of the conflict between government troops and pro-Russian separatists. The plane left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on 17 July 2014 and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on the following day. Malaysia plane crash: What we know MH17: Our special report Who were the victims? The plane lost contact with air traffic control about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. This video can not be played The Dutch Safety Board released an animated video showing the flight path of the plane It crashed in the Donetsk area, in territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Footage was later released by the Ukrainian government suggesting that a Buk missile had been brought in from Russia on the day of the crash, and then taken back across the border the next day. In October 2015 the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the plane had indeed been hit by a Buk missile. This video can not be played How does a Buk missile system work? In September 2016, the JIT - which includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - reached a similar conclusion in a preliminary report. It said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the missile had been brought in from Russian territory and fired from a field controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The investigators simulated various trajectories of the warhead. They showed it had exploded metres above the aeroplane's nose, showering the aircraft with fragments. On Thursday Russia restated its position that none of its forces had been involved. ""Not a single anti-aircraft missile system from the Russian Federation has ever crossed the Russia-Ukraine border,"" the defence ministry in Moscow said. MeanwhileUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko promised in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian) that he would ""spare no effort to ensure that the actions of the Russian Federation as a state which supports terrorism get an appropriate assessment"",externalin the International Court of Justice.

"People with Romanian nationality have become the second most common non-British population living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics says the total number of Romanian nationals rose by 25% from 2016 to 2017, reaching 411,000. Of the 65,176,000 residents in the UK, 6.2 million were non-UK nationals - up by 4%. The number of people living in the UK but born abroad was up by 3% from 2016 - 9.4 million of the total population. Net migration falls to 248,000 in 2016 A problem with the collection of statistics means there is no overall net migration figure. The government has committed to a target to reduce net migration to below 100,000 in its manifestos of 2010, 2015 and 2017. The figures show that 61% of the non-UK nationals number - or 3.8 million - are from the EU. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Wading through the vast amount of immigration data published by the Office for National Statistics, the Home Office, and the Department for Work and Pensions, one thing becomes clear: Britain remains an attractive destination for visitors and migrants. The overall population is up, the number of visas is up, and citizenship applications are up. For the growing number of Romanians coming to Britain, the attraction is mainly the ability to work and earn more than they would do in their home country. There are signs however that the number of EU nationals seeking employment may have plateaued, with registrations for national insurance numbers in the 12 months to the end of March down 20% on the previous year. The next set of figures, in August, will confirm whether that's a blip or a trend. Poland remains the most common non-UK nationality, with an estimated one million Polish people living in the UK. After Romania, third place goes to the Republic of Ireland, with 350,000 nationals in the UK. India falls to fourth with 346,000 nationals in the UK - a place formerly held by Romania. The non-UK population - both those who are born abroad or are not British nationals - has increased every year since reporting began in 2004. The number of applications by EU nationals for UK citizenship doubled to over 40,000 in the 12 months leading to March 2018. The number of EU nationals issued permanent residence cards - available to those who have lived in the UK for five years - also rose to 168,000. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it highlighted ""the Brexit effect"", as people from the EU sought certainty that they could live in the UK after it leaves the union.

"Taxes are going to have to rise to pay for the NHS if the UK is to avoid ""a decade of misery"" in which the old, sick and vulnerable are let down, say experts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Health Foundation said the NHS would need an extra 4% a year - or Â£2,000 per UK household - for the next 15 years. It said the only realistic way this could be paid for was by tax rises. It comes as ministers are arguing behind the scenes about NHS funding. NHS at 70: Share your memories and stories Why the Treasury is no fan of a ring-fenced 'NHS tax' NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff May backs long-term funding plan for NHS Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff Join our Facebook group on the NHS and share your views.,external The prime minister has promised a long-term funding plan for the NHS. This is expected to cover the next decade and could be announced as soon as next month, in time for the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS. It has been announced that an 'NHS assembly' will be set up where national and local stakeholders can discuss progress on achieving plans for the NHS's future. The Treasury is believed to want to keep average rises at about 2% a year, but other ministers are arguing for more, the BBC understands. Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to want at least 3% a year.

As those discussions continue, the IFS and Health Foundation have revealed the findings of their review, commissioned by the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts. It warned the ageing population and rising number of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, meant the health service needed more than it had been getting in the past decade. In recent years the annual rises once inflation is taken into account have been limited to just over 2%. But continuing in this vein would lead to a continued deterioration in performance, the report warned. Instead, it said, 5% extra was needed in the next five years, and then just under 4% for the following decade if it was going to improve. That would work out at an average of 4% a year over the period, while 3.3% would simply maintain services. On top of that, extra money would also be needed to fund council-run social care for the elderly. That would mean spending as a proportion of national income rising from 8.4% currently to 11.4%. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May is grappling with ministers over NHS funding There's no coincidence at all that the independent number crunchers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation, have come forward with calls for significantly more cash for NHS England today. It matters right now because behind closed doors in Whitehall, the Department of Health, Downing Street and the Treasury are grappling to agree, not just how much the NHS really needs, but also what the government can really afford. Any eventual long term settlement involves extra billions of taxpayers' money - but if the government falls short, there's a heavy potential cost. What to do next is an intensely political choice. Read more of Laura's blog here. The report said it was ""hard to imagine"" raising that sort of money without increases in taxes. NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson urged ministers not to rush into a quick fix, but warned any attempts to limit rises to 2% would backfire and lead to a ""decade of misery"". ""It is now undeniable that the current system and funding levels are not sustainable,"" he said. The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were being put in place to agree a multi-year settlement. The extra Â£2,000 in tax per household seems an eye-watering amount. But there is some context. That is the amount that would be needed by 2033 - and the economists were quick to point out that this has to be seen in the context that households will become richer. The forecast is that household wealth will rise by over Â£8,000 a year. So paying for the NHS would gobble up just under a quarter of that. Add in social care and it will be over a quarter. To increase tax income by that amount, it would require rises of 3p in the pound on each of income tax, VAT and National Insurance. Although the report said other options, including taxes on property and businesses, could be explored too. Even so, that would leave the UK as a relatively low-tax country. In terms of what that buys in the health service, Â£2,000 does not go very far. It will pay for a month of a staff nurse's salary, or cover 16 visits to A&E or eight ambulance journeys to hospital.

"A woman and her child are the main characters in the TV advert Britain's secret service will air its first recruitment advert on national TV later in a bid to encourage more women and ethnic minorities to join MI6. The intelligence officers would help find new secret agents and check information gathered is legitimate. The poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury resulted in a surge of applications, officials say. But they want to broaden their reach, and say they want people who ""challenge the status quo"". The latest official figures from March 2016 showed 24.1% of senior staff and 37.8% of non-senior staff were women. There were also no British, Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) members among the senior ranks and they accounted for just 6.8% of the non-senior staff. The advert, which will be shown in a break during Channel 4 News at around 19:30 BST, begins with an image of a shark - stereotypically a depiction of ""evil"" in James Bond films. But later it turns to a mother comforting a child and tells viewers MI6 wants people who have understanding and emotional skills. ""Secretly, we're just like you"" is the tagline of the campaign. MI6 wants people who can pick up on ""the silent cues that matter"" MI6 has long had a deeply ambivalent relationship with its fictional portrayal in the James Bond films. Last year,the Secret Intelligence Service broadcast adverts at the cinemato attract a different type of candidate. The image of a ruthless spy with a licence to kill who saves the world has done wonders for the MI6 brand, but it does not reflect the reality of work inside the organisation and the concern is that it may have put some people off joining. I wish mum's phone was never invented Saudi women's rights crackdown widens Forgetful couple find 'lost' parked car Chief of the service, Alex Younger, said MI6 needs to have the diverse workforce ""to meet the challenges we face"" and avoid having a groupthink approach. ""We want people who have never thought of joining MI6 to join MI6"", he says. ""People who challenge the status quo - in a respectful way - are valued,"" he added. The average starting salary is around Â£35,000 to Â£37,000 for the intelligence officer positions and all applicants must pass a vetting process. James Bond doesn't really reflect the work MI6 does, officials say Intelligence officers perform three different functions. Targeters identify individuals who may have access to secret information who MI6 might be able to recruit as agents. Case officers cultivate, build and manage the relationships with those agents. ""R"" or requirements officers make sure the intelligence that is produced by agents is valid and also relevant to the customers in government who receive it. This latter function was boosted in the aftermath of MI6's performance over Iraq's weapons of mass destruction when erroneous intelligence was used to justify military action. Previously, applicants would have had to prove their parents had been born in the UK, but this requirement is now being looked at. ""We are making our nationality rules slightly more flexible, to support our diversity agenda and enable a wider selection of candidates to join us,"" a recruitment official for MI6 said.

"Adam George enjoys an active lifestyle A severely disabled boy is suing a theme park for failing to provide a suitable ""changing places"" lavatory. Adam George, 11, claims Flambards Theme Park, in Cornwall, discriminated and failed to make reasonable adjustments for him under the Equality Act. Changing places toilets are required by an estimated 250,000 people in the UK who need extra specialist equipment. Flambards says it takes inclusion of all visitors seriously and has made adjustments to its toilets. The company says a permanent changing places toilet would cost over Â£40,000 - an expense that could affect jobs. Adam, from Redruth in Cornwall, was born with a genetic condition that weakens his muscles, affects his speech and makes him a full-time wheelchair user.  He also has autism. But none of this has held him back and he loves outdoor activities. His favourite place for a day out is the nearby Flambards Theme Park in Helston. Adam loves a day out at Flambards Theme Park His mother, Rachel, says: ""He loves rides. He loves things that go up and down and move him suddenly. ""He can't climb, he can't walk, he can't jump, he can't run, so all of the physical sensations that are well known to be vital to a child's developments are out of Adam's bounds, so a theme park enables him to have so many of those vital experiences."" In order to use the toilet Adam has to be hoisted on to a table, then on to the loo. He then needs to be hoisted back on to a large changing table. Rachel is a member of the groupChanging Places,external, which aims to increase access for those who need the extra space, hoists and changing tables provided in these toilet facilities. In the past 11 years, the group has successfully seen more than 1,000 of the toilets installed across the country. Flambards, though, doesn't have a toilet with changing facilities suitable for Adam's needs, so when the family visit, they need to hire a Mobiloo. This is a large converted horse-box with the space and equipment Adam requires, but it can cost up to Â£350. The Mobiloo has toilet facilities that mean Adam's mother Rachel can help her son Under the Equality Act 2010, all service providers are under a duty to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure that, as far as possible, disabled people enjoy the same experience as the non-disabled. Rachel recognises that it is not reasonable to expect small cafes and shops to provide changing places toilets. But she says: ""A place like Flambards, a theme park, where they expect people to arrive in the morning, stay all day, eat, drink, stay late for the fireworks show, I personally think it reasonable that I can use the toilet when I go there. ""So why shouldn't Adam? Why shouldn't all disabled people be able to have their toileting needs met with dignity and safety?"" Adam's case claims that Flambards has discriminated against him and failed to make ""reasonable adjustments"" for his needs. It is believed to be the first case brought on whether the provision of a changing places toilet is ""reasonable"". It raises the question of what is ""reasonable"" in terms of cost for a business to incur in order to comply with the Equality Act. Richard Smith, general manager at Flambards, says there are limits. ""Inclusivity is important to us to make sure that everyone has access to our park and the rides,"" says Mr Smith. ""However, there is an overall cost to put in a full-on changing places unit, and we've been quoted in excess of Â£40,000.  That would have an effect on jobs possibly."" As an interim measure, Flambards has installed a mobile hoist and a changing bed in an existing disabled toilet. Flambards has installed a mobile hoist and a changing bed in an existing disabled toilet ""We're getting feedback from the disabled community on what's working and what's not, so we can carry on developing the structures we have in place,"" Mr Smith adds. But Mrs George  says the size of the toilet at Flambards and the equipment do not meet Adam's needs, and that she was not consulted when the park put in the new equipment. She also disputes the Â£40,000 cost of a changing places loo, claiming one could be put in for closer to Â£10,000. The Georges' solicitor, Chris Fry, of Fry Law, sees their legal challenge as part of a shift in society's understanding of disability. ""This case is part of an evolution in awareness of disability rights and how to enforce them,"" says Mr Fry. ""Adam's growing up in a more inclusive culture where disabled people quite rightly expect more for their money - if a venue advertises itself as accessible then it really should be fully accessible. ""This is a more inclusive world than it was,  where a business can afford to provide the same service to everyone, society should expect them to do it."" Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of charity Muscular Dystrophy UK, said:  ""Access to toilets is something that a lot of people take for granted, and it is shocking that families need to bring cases like this forward just to safeguard their children's dignity. ""We need to see building regulations changed so that all new buildings over a certain size - including theme parks - include changing places facilities."" Adam just wants to spend days out with his friends, but whether he can depends in part on what the law decides is ""reasonable"" for others to provide in enabling him to go to the toilet.

"People with Romanian nationality have become the second most common non-British population living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics says the total number of Romanian nationals rose by 25% from 2016 to 2017, reaching 411,000. Of the 65,176,000 residents in the UK, 6.2 million were non-UK nationals - up by 4%. The number of people living in the UK but born abroad was up by 3% from 2016 - 9.4 million of the total population. Net migration falls to 248,000 in 2016 A problem with the collection of statistics means there is no overall net migration figure. The government has committed to a target to reduce net migration to below 100,000 in its manifestos of 2010, 2015 and 2017. The figures show that 61% of the non-UK nationals number - or 3.8 million - are from the EU. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Wading through the vast amount of immigration data published by the Office for National Statistics, the Home Office, and the Department for Work and Pensions, one thing becomes clear: Britain remains an attractive destination for visitors and migrants. The overall population is up, the number of visas is up, and citizenship applications are up. For the growing number of Romanians coming to Britain, the attraction is mainly the ability to work and earn more than they would do in their home country. There are signs however that the number of EU nationals seeking employment may have plateaued, with registrations for national insurance numbers in the 12 months to the end of March down 20% on the previous year. The next set of figures, in August, will confirm whether that's a blip or a trend. Poland remains the most common non-UK nationality, with an estimated one million Polish people living in the UK. After Romania, third place goes to the Republic of Ireland, with 350,000 nationals in the UK. India falls to fourth with 346,000 nationals in the UK - a place formerly held by Romania. The non-UK population - both those who are born abroad or are not British nationals - has increased every year since reporting began in 2004. The number of applications by EU nationals for UK citizenship doubled to over 40,000 in the 12 months leading to March 2018. The number of EU nationals issued permanent residence cards - available to those who have lived in the UK for five years - also rose to 168,000. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it highlighted ""the Brexit effect"", as people from the EU sought certainty that they could live in the UK after it leaves the union.

"Deutsche Bank has said it will cut more than 7,000 jobs as Germany's biggest lender attempts to return to profit. The bank said,externalit would reduce global staffing levels from just over 97,000 to ""well below 90,000"". Following a review of the business, the number of jobs in Deutsche's equities sales and trading business is being cut by a quarter. The bank - which employs 8,500 people in the UK - did not say which countries would be affected by the job cuts. Deutsche Bank employs about 66,000 people in Europe - including 42,000 in Germany, 21,000 in Asia and about 10,000 in North America. The bank had already flagged up that job cuts were on the way last month, with chief executive Christian Sewing saying at the time that they would be ""painful but regrettably unavoidable"". On Thursday, Mr Sewing said: ""We remain committed to our Corporate & Investment Bank and our international presence - we are unwavering in that. ""We are Europe's alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well."" The job cuts are the first major move by Mr Sewing, who took up the role last month afterhis predecessor, John Cryan, was sacked. The search for his replacement is understood to have begunafter the bank reported an annual loss of â¬500m (Â£438m),externalat the end of February. That followed losses of â¬1.4bn in 2016, and â¬6.8bn in 2015 after restructuring and litigation costs. The job cut announcement came ahead of Deutsche Bank's annual shareholder meeting. At the meeting, the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, said that while Mr Cryan had ""set the ball rolling"" on reform, he had displayed ""shortcomings in decision-making and implementation"". ""You are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,"" he said. ""If there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively."" Deutsche Bank's share price is currently trading at just below â¬11, down more than a third from 2017's high of â¬17.57.

"This video can not be played Investigators said in 2018 they had evidence of the route taken by a Russian missile convoy The missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade, international investigators say. For the first time, the Dutch-led team said the missile had come from a unit based in western Russia. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It was hit by a missile fired from rebel-held territory in Ukraine. Russia says none of its weapons was used. But on Thursday Wilbert Paulissen, a Dutch official from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), told reporters: ""All the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces."" He restated the JIT's conclusion that the plane had been destroyed by a Russian-made Buk missile, adding that it had been supplied by the country's 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk. At a news conference in the Dutch city of Utrecht, the investigators also showed social media pictures which they said traced the route the missile convoy had taken to reach eastern Ukraine. The incident occurred at the height of the conflict between government troops and pro-Russian separatists. The plane left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on 17 July 2014 and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on the following day. Malaysia plane crash: What we know MH17: Our special report Who were the victims? The plane lost contact with air traffic control about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. This video can not be played The Dutch Safety Board released an animated video showing the flight path of the plane It crashed in the Donetsk area, in territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Footage was later released by the Ukrainian government suggesting that a Buk missile had been brought in from Russia on the day of the crash, and then taken back across the border the next day. In October 2015 the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the plane had indeed been hit by a Buk missile. This video can not be played How does a Buk missile system work? In September 2016, the JIT - which includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - reached a similar conclusion in a preliminary report. It said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the missile had been brought in from Russian territory and fired from a field controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The investigators simulated various trajectories of the warhead. They showed it had exploded metres above the aeroplane's nose, showering the aircraft with fragments.

"The pound is taking a turn in a new direction with vertical notes. What will be the only sterling bank notes of upright orientation in circulation are being printed by Ulster Bank. The polymer Â£5 and Â£10 notes will enter circulation in Northern Ireland next year. All four of Northern Ireland's banks print their own money, a tradition which dates back to the 19th century Ulster Bank, which is part of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), has released the designs of its new notes, which will replace its paper currency. They are based on the theme ""living in nature"". The Â£5 note features Strangford Lough in County Down and Brent Geese. Its Â£10 denomination shows Lough Erne in County Fermanagh, the Irish hare and Guelder-rose shrubs. The bank announced last year that it would be following the Bank of England by printing plastic money. However, Ulster Bank is going a step further with the new format. Switzerland and Canada (who will introduce a vertical $10 note later this year), are among the few countries that have notes which are vertical in orientation.

"This video can not be played The attack on the family's house in Salford was captured on CCTV Two men who murdered four children by torching their home with petrol bombs have been given life sentences. Zak Bolland, 23, and David Worrall, 26, were convicted of murdering Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson in Walkden, Salford in December. Courtney Brierley, 20, was cleared of their murders but found guilty of four counts of manslaughter following the blaze. Bolland was jailed for a minimum of 40 years and Worrall for 37 years. A judge at Manchester Crown Court also sentenced Brierley to 21 years in a young offenders institution. Mr Justice William Davis said the four children ""died a terrible death"". Sandra Lever, the children's grandmother, said the offenders were ""evil"". ""To think and do anything like this with four babies in the house, and a woman, and two other children, it's just beyond me."" Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma The jury heard Bolland, who lived 300 yards from the Pearsons, was high on drink and drugs when he launched the fatal attack, which was motivated by a petty feud with the victims' 17-year-old brother Kyle Pearson. Along with Worrall, he filled two glass bottles with Â£1.50 of petrol bought from a local garage, stuffing the tops with tissue paper as they prepared the attack shortly before 05:00 GMT. They removed a fence panel from the garden of the family's home in Jackson Street, smashed a kitchen window and threw in the two lit petrol bombs. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Zak Bolland (left) and David Worrall were found guilty of the murders of four siblings Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, all died in the blaze. Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 36, was rescued, severely injured, along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Neighbour Karen Kormoss told the jury during the murder trial Mrs Pearson screamed ""not the kids"" as the flames took hold. She said she saw the windows blown out and flames coming from upstairs and downstairs within two minutes. Bolland and Worrall threw two lit petrol bombs at the family's home Mrs Pearson dialled 999 but she was overcome with heat and smoke before completing the call. She spent four months in a coma and still suffers with dreadful burns and has had several infections. She has been told about the deaths of her children but ""it's questionable how much she's absorbed and is aware of what she's been told"", the court heard. Bolland was found guilty of three counts of the attempted murder of Mrs Pearson, Kyle, and his friend Bobby Harris who was staying at their house. Worrall, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Bolland's then-girlfriend Courtney Brierley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter Worrall and Brierley broke down in tears as the verdicts were read out in court. Bolland blinked and looked down to the floor. The court heard Bolland was friends with Kyle until the defendant's car was set on fire and his house windows smashed and he blamed the teenager. Mrs Pearson had called police on at least five occasions in the two weeks before her children died, saying Bolland was threatening to use fire to harm her family. He set their wheelie bin on fire two days before the fatal fire and threatened to ""kill 'em all"" four hours before he torched the house, the court heard. CCTV shown to the jury showed Bolland and Worrall at the address at 04:55 for one minute and five seconds. The cameras recorded a flash then a larger second one from the petrol bombs, before they fled. Bolland, who admitted throwing the second petrol bomb but denied all other charges said he intended only to damage the house which he thought was not occupied. ""I heard like a big whoosh. I didn't look back,"" he told the jury. Zak Bolland lived 300 yards from the Pearsons Worrall, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, said he thought they were only going to set fire to wheelie bins and denied throwing a petrol bomb. Brierley, from Walkden, said she did not know the two men had petrol bombs and claims Bolland had a ""controlling influence"" over her during their ""toxic"" relationship. Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said it was one of the ""most heartbreaking cases"" he had ever dealt with. ""I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children,"" he said.

"Simon, not his real name, was forced to hand over hundreds of pounds after being blackmailed by an international criminal gang There's been a big rise in the number of victims of sextortion being reported to the National Crime Agency (NCA). There were 1,304 cases reported in 2017, up from 428 in 2015 - although the real number of victims is thought to be much higher. Sextortion is when people, mainly men in their teens and twenties, are talked into letting themselves be filmed carrying out sex acts. Victims are secretly recorded and then blackmailed by criminal gangs. Warning: Contains graphic sexual references. NCA investigators say ""tens of thousands"" of people are putting themselves at risk. It happened to one man, who we agreed to call Simon to help try to protect his identity. ""What happened was the computer screen I was looking at flipped - and I was then watching a video of myself back on a loop,"" he told Newsbeat. Simon, who is in his twenties, had met a woman online he thought was interested in getting into a relationship with him. Before long they were making video calls, shortly after that he was getting intimate with her and that's when he agreed to let himself be filmed masturbating. ""As soon as I saw the screen flip, I knew what was coming,"" Simon told us. ""I know this sort of stuff happens but you never expect it to happen to you. ""They said: 'We want Â£600 or we're going to send this video to all of your friends and family.'"" This video can not be played The National Crime Agency released this video to show how easy it is to be caught out by blackmailers Simon had just become the victim of an international criminal gang, most likely based in the Philippines. They'd recorded the footage and were playing it back at him. ""I don't know how but they'd got the names and contact details of my friends and family and work colleagues. ""It certainly felt a lot more sinister at that point. It felt more real as opposed to just a scam where someone's trying to rip you off. That's when it got really serious."" Simon initially transferred Â£150 to an account in the Philippines hoping his blackmailers would leave him alone. But they didn't. Three days later they came back for more. He paid them another Â£150 and hasn't heard from them since. ""I was just...not devastated, but more disappointed. That someone would think to do this to someone else. ""I was angry at the person for doing this. I was angry at myself for letting that happen. Being so stupid basically. ""I was worried. It just shocked me."" Simon has since gone to the police and has been given advice on how to help try to catch his blackmailers if they get back in contact. ""Tens of thousands of people, mainly young men, are putting themselves at risk of sextortion,"" according to the National Crime Agency The National Crime Agency says if anyone ever finds themselves being blackmailed in this way the advice is simple. Don't panic, don't pay andcall the police,external. By its very nature sextortion is an under-reported crime and the few victims that do come forward to police often have no way of knowing who blackmailed them or how to get their money back. That's one of the reasons the true number of victims is thought to be much higher than the figures reported to the NCA. Investigators at the agency believe millions of pounds is blackmailed from victims in the UK each year. Roy Sinclair from the National Crime Agency told Newsbeat: ""Tens of thousands of people, mainly young men, are putting themselves at risk of sextortion. ""Some people have paid the ultimate price and we know of at least five people who've taken their own life because they felt there was no other way out."" Joanne Bocko is a Cyber Protect Officer for Avon and Somerset Police and says there are serious risks to getting naked on camera. ""People need to be aware - once that footage is made, it's gone and it's out of your hands what happens next,"" she says. ""Most likely it's organised crime groups in the Philippines, Morocco. And their job will be to bring cash in from victims all around the world."" As for how serious the problem can get, Joanne is blunt. ""People have killed themselves over this kind of thing in the UK. So it can be very, very serious. ""Just imagine - indecent or naked images of yourself going to your boss, your friends, your family. It can be absolutely devastating and horrendous for those people involved. ""Ultimately we'd advise people not to get naked on webcam - but we understand it happens.""

"Some schools rated outstanding may no longer be as good as their rating suggests, Ofsted has said amid official criticism of its work in England. A National Audit Office report found 1,620 schools, mostly outstanding, had not been inspected for six years or more, and 290 for a decade or more. Outstanding schools were decreed exempt from routine inspections in 2011. Ofsted bosses said there was no way of telling if these schools had since fallen into a ""mediocre"" category. Although, inspections can be triggered at any school if a safeguarding concern is raised, or if there is a significant drop in results. It no longer goes into these top-rated schools on a regular basis. Ofsted's director of corporate strategy, Luke Tryl, said: ""What we can't tell is if the levels of education in those schools judged outstanding 10 years ago are the same or whether it has changed to become middling, or mediocre or coasting."" When asked by reporters if he was saying that some ""outstanding schools aren't really outstanding"", he replied: ""Yes."" However, many schools will have their ""outstanding"" label highlighted on their websites and on banners outside their premises. And many parents base at least their initial views of such schools on these Ofsted rankings. The NAO found the inspectorate's ""effectiveness has reduced"" as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and Ofsted to end routine inspections for outstanding and good schools. Ofsted said it had since been lobbying the DfE to reinstate routine inspections every six years for a primary schools and every five or seven years for a secondary. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""If Ofsted has reason to believe a school is no longer meeting its previous high standards, we would expect it to use its powers to carry out a full inspection -  this has always been the case - and remains so."" He added that the inspectorate was given Â£40m a year to provide a school inspection regime that is focused on the schools that need the most improvement. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said most parents were ""savvy enough"" to look at a range of evidence on school effectiveness and did not just rely on Ofsted rankings. His organisation has also been arguing for inspections of outstanding schools to be reinstated, calling for one every five years or so. The schools inspectorate was also found to have missed its own targets on the re-inspection of the weakest schools - those rated inadequate. The target of 24 months for such a re-inspection had been missed in 6% of cases, 78 schools, between 2012 and 2016, the NAO said. These schools would have weak teaching, weak leadership and possibly some behaviour issues, Ofsted said. The NAO report said: ""Ofsted has extended some of the targets to allow schools more time to improve. ""This has also allowed Ofsted to spread re-inspections over a longer period."" But Ofsted told the NAO it had found it difficult to meet its inspection targets because of cuts to its budget and because it did not have enough inspectors. In 2015, ittook a decision to bring all its inspectors in houseafter a string of complaints about inspections that had been contracted out to private companies. This had left it with a shortfall of inspectors, although this had improved in 2016-17, the NAO said. Matthew Coffey, Ofsted's chief operations officer, defended the decision to effectively reduce the number of inspectors, saying it was taken on quality grounds. But he added that some of its most senior inspectors, HMIs (her majesty's inspectors), had left to run some of the numerous multi-academy trust chains being formed at the time. He said: ""Becoming an HMI used to be a traditional end of career role, and it's not like that any more."" ""It was a challenge"", he said, to compete with academy trusts able to pay salaries of Â£100,000 or more. HMIs were paid about Â£70,000, he said. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: ""The fact that Ofsted has been subject to constant cuts over more than a decade, and regular shifts in focus, speaks volumes. ""It indicates a lack of clarity about how best to obtain assurance about the quality of schools. ""The department needs to be mindful that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection. ""To demonstrate its commitment, the department needs a clear vision for school inspection and to resource it accordingly."" Nick Brook, NAHT deputy general secretary, said it was essential to hold schools to account, but the current system was muddled. ""Schools and parents alike will be concerned to read that the NAO has concluded that the level of independent assurance about schools' effectiveness has reduced. Confidence in the quality and reliability of inspection is of paramount importance to all.""

"Deutsche Bank has said it will cut more than 7,000 jobs as Germany's biggest lender attempts to return to profit. The bank said,externalit would reduce global staffing levels from just over 97,000 to ""well below 90,000"". Following a review of the business, the number of jobs in Deutsche's equities sales and trading business is being cut by a quarter. The bank - which employs 8,500 people in the UK - did not say which countries would be affected by the job cuts. Deutsche Bank employs about 66,000 people in Europe - including 42,000 in Germany, 21,000 in Asia and about 10,000 in North America. The bank had already flagged up that job cuts were on the way last month, with chief executive Christian Sewing saying at the time that they would be ""painful but regrettably unavoidable"". On Thursday, Mr Sewing said: ""We remain committed to our Corporate & Investment Bank and our international presence - we are unwavering in that. ""We are Europe's alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well."" The job cuts are the first major move by Mr Sewing, who took up the role last month afterhis predecessor, John Cryan, was sacked. The search for his replacement is understood to have begunafter the bank reported an annual loss of â¬500m (Â£438m),externalat the end of February. That followed losses of â¬1.4bn in 2016, and â¬6.8bn in 2015 after restructuring and litigation costs. The job cut announcement came ahead of Deutsche Bank's annual shareholder meeting. At the meeting, the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, said that while Mr Cryan had ""set the ball rolling"" on reform, he had displayed ""shortcomings in decision-making and implementation"". ""You are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,"" he said. ""If there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively."" Deutsche Bank's share price is currently trading at just below â¬11, down more than a third from 2017's high of â¬17.57.

"The court heard Sophie Lionnet's body showed signs of ""significant violence"" A former member of Boyzone embroiled in the murder case of his ex-girlfriend's French nanny told jurors he ""never, ever"" had any contact with the victim. Mark Walton was allegedly a focal point of his former partner's campaign of torture against Sophie Lionnet. Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, beat the 21-year-old au pair into a confessionthat she was in league with Mr Walton to spy on the family, the Old Bailey heard. They deny killing her hours later. Ms Lionnet's body wasthrown on to a bonfire in their garden in Southfields, south-west London, the court heard. Sophie Lionnet's body was found after neighbours raised concerns about a fire in a back garden Giving evidence, Mr Walton, who is based in Los Angeles, told jurors his ex-partner, Ms Kouider, would ""flip"" during their two-year turbulent relationship. He would support the fashion designer with thousands of pounds every month, even paying her rent long after she left him, he told the court. On their relationship, he said: ""It was turbulent, probably the most turbulent relationship I had ever been in. ""She would go from a softly spoken French accent, then she would flip, get very angry, very loud and just not care where we were. ""She would just go crazy over something trivial."" The first he heard about Miss Lionnet was on 21 September last year when he was contacted by murder detectives, he said. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder Referring to accusations levelled at him by Ms Kouider, prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: ""Have you ever been party to a plot to drug the people in the Wimbledon flat and, whilst unconscious, sexually abuse the occupants?"" Mr Walton said: ""Absolutely not."" He said the last time he was in the UK was when he went to a meeting in October 2015 and he told jurors he had ""never, ever"" heard of Ms Lionnet or ever been in contact with her. Mr Walton told jurors he ""created"" Boyzone in 1993 and was in the band for about a year before going on to be involved in Fifth Avenue. 1993:Auditions take place for a new Irish boyband. Mark Walton, along with Keith Duffy, Ronan Keating, Shane Lynch and Richie Rock form Boyzone and are later managed by Louis Walsh 1994:Mark Walton and Richie Rock leave the band 2000s:After Boyzone, Mr Walton sets up a band called Fifth Avenue, and also gets involved with the management of Irish girlband B*Witched 2015:Mr Walton appears as a judge on Vietnam's Pop Idol 2017:Mr Walton named during the murder case of his ex-girlfriend's French nanny By the time he met Ms Kouider in 2011 he was doing well financially in the music business, he said.

"The Galileo system was conceived to give Europe an independent sat-nav capability The UK wants the EU to repay Â£1bn if it is excluded from the Galileo satellite navigation system after Brexit. David Davis's Brexit department is also warning the scheme could cost the EU an extra â¬1bn (Â£876m) without the UK's continued involvement. The row could harm wider post-Brexit security co-operation,the department says in a new paper,external. UK ministers are angry about the EU's decision to limit access to Galileo, an alternative to the US GPS system. The UK played a major role in developing satellites for Galileo, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026. But Brussels has cited legal issues about sharing sensitive information with a non-member state for its decision to shut British firms out of the project. Brussels has also said it will restrict access to encrypted signals from Galileo. In its position paper, the UK government repeats its threat to build its own satellite navigation system - which has been estimated would cost up to Â£5bn - as a rival to Galileo. UK ups the ante on Galileo project Can the UK really go it alone with a new sat-nav scheme? Brexit customs plan 'could cost Â£20bn' The paper registers the UK's ""strong objection to its ongoing exclusion from security-related discussions"" about Galileo, which it says ""risks being interpreted as a lack of trust in the United Kingdom"". Downing Street said the UK has held ""constructive discussions"" with the European Commission on staying in the Galileo satellite navigation project. But the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU had not accepted UK proposals for continued participation in the technology behind Galileo, nor co-operation on security and data protection. Asked if the EU would repay the Â£1bn already invested in Galileo if the UK was excluded from work on the project, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: ""This issue is being discussed with our British partners, negotiations are ongoing, these are precisely the sort of issues we need to address."" The UK government has also threatened to block Galileo satellites from using ground tracking stations in British overseas territories, such as the Falklands. The European Commission says the UK will have to apply to use the Public Regulated Service (PRS), a key element of the Galileo system, like any other non-EU country after its March 2019 departure. A navigation and timing signal intended for use by government agencies, armed forces and ""blue light"" services, PRS is designed to be available and robust even in times of crisis. This video can not be played Why is there a row about Galileo? Brussels says the UK cannot immediately have access to it when it leaves the European bloc because it will become a foreign entity and PRS is for EU member states only. In the Department for Exiting the EU position paper, UK officials warn that excluding the UK from Galileo contravenes the withdrawal deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU in December. It says: ""Excluding industrial participation by UK industry in security-related areas risks delays of up to three years and additional costs of up to â¬1 billion. ""It will not be straightforward to effectively fulfil all Galileo security work elsewhere."" Sir Ivan Rogers, who quit as the UK's ambassador to the EU last year in protest at the ""muddled"" Brexit negotiations, suggested the EU was partly motivated by a desire to transfer work on Galileo to firms based in the EU. In a speech on Wednesday, Sir Ivan said: ""The UK genuinely wants to remain a major player in the project, with privileged ongoing access from outside the EU, and views its capabilities and contribution to date as giving it the right to that ticket. ""For the EU, the decision to leave inevitably entails relegation to a different role and status in the project, and, let's be candid, offers scope for EU-located firms to take contractual business away from UK ones."" Artwork: Galileo satellites are now launching on Europe's premier rocket, the Ariane 5 A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will also have six spares in orbit 22 spacecraft are in orbit today; the 30 figure is likely to be reached in 2021 Original budget was â¬3bn but will now cost more than three times that Spacecraft have been launched in batches of two, but now go up four at a time Will work alongside the US-owned GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less Sir Ivan also suggested in his speech that some in Brussels might also recall that the British government, under pro-EU Tony Blair, tried to prevent Galileo getting off the ground 18 years ago. He said it was ironic that ""a much more Eurosceptic set of politicians"" were now ""complaining bitterly"" that ""post Brexit, the field might be somehow tilted more against the depth of participation we now are enthusiasts for"". Separately, the UK has outlined the extent of existing law enforcement capabilities which would be lost if a bespoke security deal is not agreed after Brexit. According to details of a presentation seen by the BBC, the UK says there will be ""significant gaps"" in a wide range of areas including prisoner transfers, asset recovery, sharing of financial intelligence, victim compensation and access to criminal records for child protection vetting.

"The pound is taking a turn in a new direction with vertical notes. What will be the only sterling bank notes of upright orientation in circulation are being printed by Ulster Bank. The polymer Â£5 and Â£10 notes will enter circulation in Northern Ireland next year. All four of Northern Ireland's banks print their own money, a tradition which dates back to the 19th century Ulster Bank, which is part of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), has released the designs of its new notes, which will replace its paper currency. They are based on the theme ""living in nature"". The Â£5 note features Strangford Lough in County Down and Brent Geese. Its Â£10 denomination shows Lough Erne in County Fermanagh, the Irish hare and Guelder-rose shrubs. The bank announced last year that it would be following the Bank of England by printing plastic money. However, Ulster Bank is going a step further with the new format. Switzerland and Canada (who will introduce a vertical $10 note later this year), are among the few countries that have notes which are vertical in orientation.

"Sophie Lionnet moved to London from her home in north-east France in January 2016 A couple who tortured their French au pair before burning her body in their garden have been convicted of her murder. Why did Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni kill 21-year-old Sophie Lionnet? As a motive for murder, it is bizarre beyond belief. Kouider, 35, suspected her former boyfriend Mark Walton, a founding member of the Irish pop group Boyzone, was having an affair with her young au pair. The Old Bailey heard how she and 40-year-old Medouni applied ""pressure and relentless intimidation"" on Miss Lionnet to admit being in a sexual relationship with Mr Walton. They insisted their young au pair had helped him come to the couple's home in the London suburb of Southfields to drug and sexually abuse the occupants. Hours of footage recorded by Kouider and Medouni over several months showed a terrified Miss Lionnet also being accused of being a paedophile and a spy. Threatened with rape, prison and more violence, she eventually made a confession to having an affair with Mr Walton - a man who told the couple's trial that she'd never even met. Soon after she was dead. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider had been in an on-off relationship since meeting in 2001 Miss Lionnet, from Troyes in north-east France, had moved to the UK in January 2016 in order to improve her English. ""She was a pearl. Kind, gentle. She loved everyone, she loved making people happy,"" her aunt said, speaking about her niece at a march held a month after Miss Lionnet's death. During the au pair's employment by the couple, she became known to various people in the Southfields community. Local restaurant owner Michael Cromer, who had been in talks with Kouider and Medouni to go into business together, said Miss Lionnet would join them when they went to meet him. Miss Lionnet's mother Catherine Devallonne and stepfather Stephane Devallonne have attended much of the trial She would sometimes also visit his fish and chip restaurant alone. ""She was always very quiet. She didn't want to communicate much,"" Mr Cromer said. The business owner could sense the au pair was struggling but never imagined what was happening at the couple's home. ""Her body language showed there was something wrong... there were times when she had tears in her eyes so I asked her why and she said her mum was not well. ""Once she said Sabrina beat her... I asked why, and she said she had dropped the butter."" Michael Cromer said he never saw anything amiss when he visited the couple's home In reality, the abuse had been going on for some time. The videos of the couple's interrogations of her showed the 21-year-old becoming thinner over the months. It was only after it was too late that the alarm would be raised, albeit inadvertently, by neighbours who called 999 over a foul-smelling fire in the garden. Thomas Hunt, one of the first firefighters on the scene, soon realised a body had been burnt when he spotted a nose and fingers in the remnants of the fire, as well as clothes and jewellery. Nanny murder trial 'stranger than fiction' Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Blue singer Duncan James denies crowbar claim Boyzone founder 'never heard' of French nanny He told the jury that when he turned to Medouni, the defendant told him it was the carcass of a sheep. Miss Lionnet's body was so badly burnt the exact cause of her death has never been established, although post-mortem tests showed she had suffered fractures to her sternum, four ribs and her jawbone in the days before her death in September of last year. In court, the couple blamed each other for the violence suffered by their au pair. Summing up the prosecution's case, Richard Howell QC described the ""odd couple"" as a ""truly toxic combination"". The court heard fashion designer Kouider was ""obsessed"" with her former partner Mark Walton Faced with such torment, why did the 21-year-old not abandon the couple's home on Wimbledon Park Road? Ruth Bowskill, a chief prosecutor at the CPS, said Miss Lionnet had wanted to leave and had written to her family in France telling them this. However, she believes Kouider and Medouni manipulated the ""particularly shy"" au pair, who knew little English, gaining control over her. ""Given the intimidation, the bullying and the behaviour towards her... it's likely that she didn't feel able to leave,"" Ms Bowskill said. Investigators also never found the au pair's passport and a plane ticket her mother had bought her to return to France and believe the couple may have confiscated them. A thin-looking Miss Lionnet was filmed during a visit to a boxing gym in London a year before her death The court was told about Kouider's erratic behaviour, including during her two-year relationship with Mr Walton. She was accused of making up ""dreadful stories about people, often of a sexual nature"" and picking on those she saw as ""weak"". The jury heard on one occasion she called police and accused Mr Walton of sexually abusing her cat - even though she did not have one. She also accused him and his friends of flying helicopters over her home. The court was told that in May 2017 Kouider was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder. Sunil Patel said he experienced Kouider's ""volatile"" side when she visited his shop While they would never have believed Kouider was capable of murder, some within the community had experienced how volatile the fashion designer could be. ""Sabrina was quirky, she had a bit of a temper,"" said Sunil Patel, who runs the local newsagent. Mr Patel was aware of Kouider's fixation with Mr Walton. ""She was obsessed with this guy... she said 'have you seen this person', and she showed me this photo of a blond-haired man on her phone."" The couple denied murder, but admitted burning Miss Lionnet's body in the garden of their home Mr Patel said that when he asked what had happened, she explained that he was ""a very dangerous person"" who had hurt her family. ""I said 'why didn't your nanny say anything about it?', and she said the nanny was complicit."" Mr Patel said although he thought Kouider's behaviour was ""weird"" he never imagined that her au pair, who also regularly visited the shop, was in any danger. Sadly, he was wrong. Speaking in October, Miss Lionnet's aunt described Kouider and Medouni as ""utterly contemptible"". ""I hope they pay a very high price.""

"Cast your mind back to the first week of the year and it looked like the NHS was heading for Armageddon. Ambulances were queuing outside A&E units unable to handover their patients, trolleys were stacking up in corridors and there was hardly a bed free anywhere. Just five weeks on and it looks as if the ship has been steadied. On Thursday, NHS bosses were heralding the improvement in performance seen during January.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Is this true? Yes. But as with all statistics it depends which ones you choose and how you present them. The flagship target for A&E is the four-hour waiting time target. During January 85.3% of patients were seen in four hours, up from the 85.1% recorded in December. But does this represent a success? The target, after all, is 95% and has now been missed for 30 months in a row. Failed NHS trust caused 'unnecessary harm' to patients A&E stats don't tell full story of a difficult winter 10 charts illustrating the troubles in the NHS There are plenty in the health service - particularly those in the corridors of power - who argue it does, pointing out the health service has one of the toughest A&E targets in the world. Performance this winter is on a par with the last one. This has come despite rising numbers of people coming to A&E - and more of those needing to be admitted on to wards amid the worst flu season since 2011. This deserves recognition especially at a time when money is so tight. Talking to doctors, nurses and managers this winter, it is clear more work than ever has gone into planning. There are now closer relationships between council care teams and hospitals, helping ensure frailer, older patients can be discharged back into the community when they are medically ready. Placing GPs in A&Es - a government initiative which has been funded this winter - has also helped as they have been able to deal with some of the more minor cases. This has meant that the rise in patients coming to A&E - up 5% this January compared with the previous one - has been absorbed without any deterioration in performance. But you have to ask at what cost? Routine treatments, including hip and knee replacements, have been cancelled en masse. The figures for those are not yet available, but it is likely the waiting list has grown substantially. And none of this gets away from the fact it has still been incredibly difficult. You only need to watch this video of Scarborough A&E doctor Dr Adrian Harrop close to tears to realise that staff feel they are being pushed too far. This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" NHS England's A&E supremo Keith Willett has said he hasn't experienced anything like this since the 1990s. And what about the impact on patients? We learnt on Thursday thatone in five patients who needed to be admitted to hospital in January experienced long delays for a bed. These are the sickest patients and yet hospitals are under so much pressure they are left waiting in corridors and side rooms for hours because beds are not available. Doctors are adamant this puts them at risk. A&E leads made that much clear when half of them put their names to a letter sent to the prime minister last monthwarning patients were dying because of the delays. What is clear is that no matter what measure you look at, the NHS is in a worse state than it has been for quite some time. In terms of A&E waits, this winter and last winter have seen a marked deterioration in performance compared with the previous two. In fact, nothing like this has been seen since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. Those working on the front line are pretty unanimous about what has caused this - a lack of money. Since 2010 health has been getting between 1% to 2% extra a year once inflation is taken into account. That compares with the more than 4% it has traditionally received. It is by far the tightest period of funding the NHS has ever experienced - and at the moment there is little sign that will end. In July the NHS turns 70. It will be a time for celebration, but also concern.

"There's no coincidence at all that the independent number crunchers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation, have come forward with calls for significantly more cash for NHS England today. Their report says 3.3% extra every year would be required to keep the service as it is, and 4% a year if the health service is to get any better - and around the same to care for the elderly too. It matters right now because behind closed doors in Whitehall, the Department of Health, Downing Street and the Treasury are grappling to agree not just how much the NHS really needs but also what the government can really afford. Government could scrap some NHS reforms May backs long-term funding plan for NHS The prime minister promised at Easter that there would be a long-term, fully-funded deal for the NHS with more resources, after years of historically low spending rises. But insiders say the final settlement could be as low as 2% a year, still billions of pounds, even though the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is understood to be asking for at least 3%. Despite a series of fraught meetings between him, the prime minister and the chancellor, there is no agreement yet on how much the service might receive, for how many years the funding will be guaranteed or how it would be paid for. And I'm told there is no certainty that a deal will be reached in time for the health service's 70th anniversary in July. Any eventual long term settlement involves extra billions of taxpayers money. But if the government falls short there's a heavy potential cost. What to do next is an intensely political choice.

"Mike Pence is a ""political dummy"", says North Korea A senior North Korean official has dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"", casting further uncertainty about a planned meeting between the two countries' leaders. Choe Son-hui said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. In recent days, both sides have said that the 12 June Trump-Kim summit could be delayed or even called off. North Korea insists it will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.

"This video can not be played Sterling Brown: ""You didn't have to touch me"" Milwaukee police have released video of officers using a stun-gun on a basketball player over a parking violation. NBA player Sterling Brown was arrested and stunned in January after parking in a disabled space. Until now, the police had refused to release the 30-minute video to the public; it shows that Mr Brown does not seem to physically resist the arrest. Police chief Alfonso Morales apologised for his officers' behaviour after an internal investigation. Speaking shortly after the release of the body cam footage, Mr Morales said he was sorry the incident ""escalated to this level"", declaring certain officers had ""acted inappropriately"" and had been disciplined.

"Mike Pence is a ""political dummy"", says North Korea A senior North Korean official has dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"", casting further uncertainty about a planned meeting between the two countries' leaders. Choe Son-hui said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. In recent days, both sides have said that the 12 June Trump-Kim summit could be delayed or even called off. North Korea insists it will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. What not to say to North Korea Pence warns N Korea not to 'play' Trump North Korea crisis in 300 words Why Choe's statement matters Choe Son-hui has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade.

"Water-resistant sunscreen products work much less well after they have been worn in the sea, a consumer group has warned ahead of the summer holiday season. Which? tested two products claiming to be water resistant and found the sun protection factor (SPF) dropped by up to 59% after 40 minutes in salt water. Cancer Research UK welcomed the study, warning no sunscreen is 100% effective. But a group representing sunscreen makers called the research alarmist. Current UK tests allow manufacturers to claim a sunscreen is water resistant if the SPF drops by as much as 50% after two 20-minute periods of immersion. The tests are carried out using tap water. However, Which? said its more rigorous tests in salt water, chlorinated water and fast moving water - conditions typically found on holidays - exposed ""serious flaws"" in the testing regime. It said the SPF of one well-known international sunscreen dived by 59% after 40 minutes of immersion. Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? How do sunscreens and lotions protect us? And a popular own-branded product fell by 34%. ""In reality, sun protection is likely to drop even further - factors such as reflection from water, heat, light, sweat, towelling and rubbing all reduce the protection of sunscreens,"" Which? said. Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight is the main preventable cause of skin cancer, according to the charity Cancer Research UK. However, the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) said Which?'s findings were flawed and consumers should have confidence in water-resistant sunscreens. Its director-general Dr Chris Flower, a chartered biologist, said current testing methods worked well. ""In fact an SPF 30 product will stop approximately 96% of UV rays reaching the skin and after robust water resistance testing the product will still filter out at least 93% of the sun's UV rays,"" he said. ""This is clearly not the dramatic reduction in efficacy that Which? implies."" Which? called for tougher regulations like those in the US and Australia, where the SPF on a product's label must be the SPF it provides after immersion. It added that UK water-resistance tests were ""unrealistic to the point of being meaningless"". Cancer Research UK says it is essential when using sunscreen to put plenty of it on ""to get the protection listed on the bottle"". It advises holidaymakers to: Reapply creams regularly Cool off in the shade rather than rely on sunscreen alone Protect skin with a T-shirt and a hat How does sunscreen work?

"The use of force was equivalent to once for every 50 black people in Greater London and once for every 200 of the white population Metropolitan Police officers are four times more likely to use force against black people compared with the white population, new figures suggest. The Metused force 62,000 times in 2017-18,externalwith more than a third of incidents involving black people. Techniques such as verbal instructions and using firearms were recorded. The Met Police said: ""The proportionate use of force is essential in some circumstances to protect the public and often themselves from violence."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the ""disproportionate use of force is discriminatory"". Police forces in Britain have been required keep a detailed record of each time an officer used force since 1 April 2017. According to the data, a black person in London is four times more likely than a white person to have force used against them by a Met Police officer, as a proportion of the population. Terrell Jones-Burton suffered seizures after being knocked off his bike by a police officer Terrell Jones-Burtonsuffered seizures after being knocked off his bikein November by a Met Police officer. ""It was horrific. I thought I had lost him,"" Terell's mother Shereen Jones said. The Met said the 15-year-old ""came off his bicycle"" and suffered facial injuries when he was stopped and arrested in Bermondsey. Ms Jones believes her son was targeted because he is black. She said: ""If you're a black boy walking around with nice clothes you're automatically deemed a drug dealer. ""Why should I feel like, because I'm a particular colour, I'm going to be a target, like we have a mark on our head? ""It's disgusting."" The case is currently with the Independent Office for Police Conduct. London's black population at the last census was 1,088,447. In 2017-18 the Met used force 22,989 times against black people. Based on population figures, the use of force was equivalent to once for every 50 black people in Greater London and once for every 200 of the white population.

"This video can not be played Sterling Brown: ""You didn't have to touch me"" Milwaukee police have released video of officers using a stun-gun on a basketball player over a parking violation. NBA player Sterling Brown was arrested and stunned in January after parking in a disabled space. Until now, the police had refused to release the 30-minute video to the public; it shows that Mr Brown does not seem to physically resist the arrest. Police chief Alfonso Morales apologised for his officers' behaviour after an internal investigation. Speaking shortly after the release of the body cam footage, Mr Morales said he was sorry the incident ""escalated to this level"", declaring certain officers had ""acted inappropriately"" and had been disciplined.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn is on his first trip to NI since becoming Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC that if he is prime minister the UK government would take a neutral position in any border poll campaign. He said he was not asking for or advocating a border poll, but would ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented ""to the letter"". Mr Corbyn is on his first trip to NI since becoming Labour leader. He also used his speech at Queen's University in Belfast to argue that Brexit must not lead to a hard border. The leader of the opposition told his audience he was not asking for a border poll, but in an interview with the BBC he was asked how a Corbyn government would handle such a campaign if it happened on his watch. ""It's within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement that such a poll could be held if there was a willingness to do so, at that point you don't stand in its way, but it is within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and I think the UK government should be neutral in that respect,"" he replied. David Cameron campaigned for the union in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum David Cameron's Conservative government campaigned for Scotland to remain in the UK ahead of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, but Mr Corbyn said he would not take that approach. ""I think there has to be a decision within terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we're dealing with conjectures here, we're quite a long way off from any of this. ""We would be ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is carried out to the letter."" Much of his speech at Queen's University focused on Brexit, arguing that it must not be allowed to damage the fragile political settlement in Northern Ireland. He also said there should not be a border in the Irish Sea. ""Let me be clear, Labour will not support any Brexit deal that includes the return of a hard border to this island,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""We are also clear there must be no effective border created in the Irish Sea either. ""That is why Labour has put forward a plan that would go a long way to solving this issue, a plan for which I believe there is a majority in Westminster."" TheUK and EU have agreed that there will be no hard border, but are at odds on how to achieve that. A major sticking point is what arrangement will be put in place if the border cannot be solved in an overall deal. The two sides accept the need for a 'backstop', but differ on how it should work. Mr Corbyn suggested that Labour's proposal for a new comprehensive EU-UK customs union has the potential to prevent communities in Northern Ireland being divided. The Labour leader also argued that maintaining an open border is not just about avoiding paperwork or tariffs. It also has symbolic significance, he said. ""An open border is a symbol of peace, two communities living and working together after years of conflict, communities who no longer feel that their traditions are under threat,"" Mr Corbyn said. Mr Corbyn also said a solution must be found to end the deadlock at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, whenpower-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. He called for the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIC) to be revived in order to help make progress. ""The British and Irish governments met many times during the last impasse - it seems to me a sensible way forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We must step up to find a creative solution in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement that avoids a return to direct Westminster rule,"" Mr Corbyn commented. What is the BIIC? Conveningthe  BIIC is favoured by nationalists, but opposed by the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) who regard it as a ""talking shop"". During Mr Corbyn's two-day visit to Northern Ireland, he will also meet business leaders in Belfast and Londonderry to discuss their concerns around Brexit. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Politics Reporter The welcome Jeremy Corbyn received at Queen's University was almost as warm as the weather. His speech was interrupted by rounds of applause from the audience several times, notably when he paid tribute to Mo Mowlam - the late Northern Ireland secretary - for her role in the Northern Ireland peace process. The speech did not make reference to a border poll, but afterwards Mr Corbyn was asked if he would support such a move if elected prime minister, by an A-Level student sitting her politics exam this afternoon. Mr Corbyn wished the student good luck and said if that was the desire of the majority of people, then it would happen under the terms set out in the Good Friday Agreement, but that he was not asking or advocating for it. His trip so far has not been without criticism as the DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell accused Mr Corbyn of snubbing a request to meet with IRA victims. Labour said it hadn't received enough notice, but that the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary of State Tony Lloyd has taken up the invite on behalf of his party leader. Jeremy Corbyn arrives at Queen's University Earlier this week, the Labour Party in Northern Ireland said it was disappointed thatMr Corbyn had not made plans to meet themduring his visit. A Labour source said the party was in communication with Labour NI and would ""be in touch to arrange a future meeting"". People in Northern Ireland have been allowed to join Labour since 2003, and they have had their own constituency branch since 2008. Whether they can contest elections is currently subject to an internal review, which is understood to be in its final stages, but any decision to change the current policy would need to be taken by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC).

"Simon, not his real name, was forced to hand over hundreds of pounds after being blackmailed by an international criminal gang There's been a big rise in the number of victims of sextortion being reported to the National Crime Agency (NCA). There were 1,304 cases reported in 2017, up from 428 in 2015 - although the real number of victims is thought to be much higher. Sextortion is when people, mainly men in their teens and twenties, are talked into letting themselves be filmed carrying out sex acts. Victims are secretly recorded and then blackmailed by criminal gangs. Warning: Contains graphic sexual references. NCA investigators say ""tens of thousands"" of people are putting themselves at risk. It happened to one man, who we agreed to call Simon to help try to protect his identity. ""What happened was the computer screen I was looking at flipped - and I was then watching a video of myself back on a loop,"" he told Newsbeat. Simon, who is in his twenties, had met a woman online he thought was interested in getting into a relationship with him. Before long they were making video calls, shortly after that he was getting intimate with her and that's when he agreed to let himself be filmed masturbating. ""As soon as I saw the screen flip, I knew what was coming,"" Simon told us. ""I know this sort of stuff happens but you never expect it to happen to you. ""They said: 'We want Â£600 or we're going to send this video to all of your friends and family.'"" This video can not be played The National Crime Agency released this video to show how easy it is to be caught out by blackmailers Simon had just become the victim of an international criminal gang, most likely based in the Philippines. They'd recorded the footage and were playing it back at him. ""I don't know how but they'd got the names and contact details of my friends and family and work colleagues. ""It certainly felt a lot more sinister at that point. It felt more real as opposed to just a scam where someone's trying to rip you off. That's when it got really serious."" Simon initially transferred Â£150 to an account in the Philippines hoping his blackmailers would leave him alone. But they didn't. Three days later they came back for more. He paid them another Â£150 and hasn't heard from them since. ""I was just...not devastated, but more disappointed. That someone would think to do this to someone else. ""I was angry at the person for doing this. I was angry at myself for letting that happen. Being so stupid basically. ""I was worried. It just shocked me."" Simon has since gone to the police and has been given advice on how to help try to catch his blackmailers if they get back in contact. ""Tens of thousands of people, mainly young men, are putting themselves at risk of sextortion,"" according to the National Crime Agency The National Crime Agency says if anyone ever finds themselves being blackmailed in this way the advice is simple. Don't panic, don't pay andcall the police,external. By its very nature sextortion is an under-reported crime and the few victims that do come forward to police often have no way of knowing who blackmailed them or how to get their money back. That's one of the reasons the true number of victims is thought to be much higher than the figures reported to the NCA. Investigators at the agency believe millions of pounds is blackmailed from victims in the UK each year. Roy Sinclair from the National Crime Agency told Newsbeat: ""Tens of thousands of people, mainly young men, are putting themselves at risk of sextortion. ""Some people have paid the ultimate price and we know of at least five people who've taken their own life because they felt there was no other way out."" Joanne Bocko is a Cyber Protect Officer for Avon and Somerset Police and says there are serious risks to getting naked on camera. ""People need to be aware - once that footage is made, it's gone and it's out of your hands what happens next,"" she says. ""Most likely it's organised crime groups in the Philippines, Morocco. And their job will be to bring cash in from victims all around the world."" As for how serious the problem can get, Joanne is blunt. ""People have killed themselves over this kind of thing in the UK. So it can be very, very serious. ""Just imagine - indecent or naked images of yourself going to your boss, your friends, your family. It can be absolutely devastating and horrendous for those people involved. ""Ultimately we'd advise people not to get naked on webcam - but we understand it happens.""

"Mike Pence is a ""political dummy"", says North Korea A senior North Korean official has dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"", casting further uncertainty about a planned meeting between the two countries' leaders. Choe Son-hui said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. In recent days, both sides have said that the 12 June Trump-Kim summit could be delayed or even called off. North Korea insists it will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. What not to say to North Korea Pence warns N Korea not to 'play' Trump North Korea crisis in 300 words Why Choe's statement matters Choe Son-hui has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade. She is one of Kim Jong-un's top aides and analysts say her statement will have been sanctioned by the leader himself. It came days after Mr Pence warned that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - where then-leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after renouncing nuclear weapons eight years earlier. This video can not be played Viewpoint: Why Trump's summit strategy was so unusual Ms Choe, in an article carried by the state news agency KCNA on Thursday, said Mr Pence had made ""unbridled and impudent remarks"". Only deal with US will save Kim - Trump Could defectors affect North Korea talks? She added: ""As a person involved in US affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing from the mouth of the US vice-president. ""Whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behaviour of the United States."" This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man: John Bolton Meanwhile North Korea is pressing ahead with plans to dismantle its only nuclear testing facility later this week. The Punggye-ri site is located in a remote part of the north-west of the country. A group of international journalists, who have been invited to observe the event, are on their way there. - 10 May: Trump says he will meet Kim in Singapore on 12 June - 12 May: North Korea announces dismantling of test site - 16 May: North threatens to scrap summit over comments by US National Security John Bolton about ""Libyan model"" - 18 May: Trump distances himself from Bolton, saying US is not pushing for Libya-style denuclearisation - 22 May: Trump insists that unless the US gets ""certain conditions... we won't have the meeting"" Analysis from Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul So we are back to name calling and threats of nuclear war - just weeks before the planned summit. Some may say this is a typical Pyongyang power play. But it was also so avoidable. North Korea had made it clear last week that mentioning the Libyan model of denuclearisation touched a nerve. Firstly because the Gaddafi regime collapsed and he was killed, but also because the North believe its weapons programme is far more advanced than Libya's ever was. So to even mention the two countries in the same context will be a grave insult and Pyongyang may feel that Washington is not showing it the respect it deserves. The US had been warned, and yet Mr Pence decided to repeat the comparison anyway. Careful diplomacy requires careful messaging and careful language, and North Korea clearly feels the Trump administration has shown a lack of discipline in this regard. It is interesting that Pyongyang decided not to target Donald Trump, who also made similar remarks. Aiming the insults at those around the president rather than Mr Trump himself may suggest North Korea is not ready to throw away the prospect of a summit quite yet. 'Dotard' Trump?

"The post-Brexit customs system favoured by Boris Johnson and other leading Brexiteers could cost businesses up to Â£20bn a year, officials have suggested. The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs told MPs firms would have to pay Â£32.50 for each customs declaration under the so-called ""max fac"" solution. Jon Thompson said any system may take between three and five years to bed in. No 10 said the Â£20bn figure was ""speculation"" but ""issues"" remained with both options being considered. The figure is higher than the Â£13bn UK contribution to the EU in 2016. Leading Tory Brexiteer John Redwood said he did not accept what he described as the HMRC's ""general figures"" but told the BBC that ""if it is going to cost this much it is the wrong system"". The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, which is currently expected to be followed by a 21 month transition phase before the longer term post-Brexit system kicks in. Reality Check: The government's customs options Tory MPs warned over 'botched' Brexit Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Ministers are currently considering two options to replace the existing customs union with the EU, which involves minimal checks, and which the government is committed to leaving. Brexiteers are sceptical about what is believed to be Theresa May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", under which the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the country. Their proposed alternative ""maximum facilitation"" proposal would rely on technology and advance verification to minimise, rather than remove, customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. During questioning by the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Thompson said that if ministers opted for the ""max fac"" solution this could cost UK and European businesses between Â£17bn and Â£20bn each year, reflecting the cost of customs declarations and complying with rules of origin requirements. At the moment, UK firms exporting to other EU countries or importing goods from the continent are not routinely required to complete goods declaration forms. Those doing business outside the EU must provide information about the type and value of goods, their destination and their tariff classification so that the right amount of VAT, duty or excise is paid. May defends customs Brexit 'backstop' Brexit customs plan has 'flaws' - Gove HMRC: No need for new border checkpoints Mr Thompson said there were about 200 million exports to the EU each year that could require customs declarations  - and a similar number of imports. Citing research by the University of Nottingham business school and by KPMG, he said the likely cost of individual declarations was between Â£20 and Â£55 - and while an average could not be authoritatively calculated, ministers had been advised a figure of Â£32.50 was plausible. Payments on either side of the border could cost Â£13bn a year in total while it was ""reasonable"" to assume any rules of origin requirements demanded by the EU could add ""several billion pounds"". ""You need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between Â£17bn and Â£20bn,"" he said. ""And the primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations."" In contrast, he said the customs partnership option - which has been described as ""crazy"" by Boris Johnson and ""flawed"" by Michael Gove - would cost business a maximum of Â£3.4bn a year - depending on how much firms chose to claim back in differential tariffs. It would, he said, take between three to five years to fully implement any new system after Brexit. A ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. While a ""functioning border"" was possible by the end of the transition period it would not be, in his opinion, be ""fully optimal"". But he said no new customs infrastructure would be needed in Northern Ireland. Mr Thompson declined to answer when it was suggested it would be easier if the UK just remained in the customs union - a solution favoured by business but rejected by ministers. Former Conservative cabinet minister John Redwood said the starting point for any new customs system should be existing arrangements for importing goods from outside the EU. ""We have a perfectly good functioning trade system with the rest of the world at the moment,"" he said. ""It does not cost anything like these figures."" The UK, he said, already had a VAT, excise and currency border with the EU based on pre-registration and electronic declarations which, if necessary, could be extended. ""None of these happen physically at the border any more with a man or a woman in a kiosk having to work it out with the lorry waiting. ""It is all done electronically away from the border with electronic manifests and computer registration... If we have to do customs dues as well it is not a greater increase in the complexity.""

Jon Thompson said any system may take between three and five years to bed in. No 10 said the Â£20bn figure was ""speculation"" but ""issues"" remained with both options being considered. The figure is higher than the Â£13bn UK contribution to the EU in 2016. Leading Tory Brexiteer John Redwood said he did not accept what he described as the HMRC's ""general figures"" but told the BBC that ""if it is going to cost this much it is the wrong system"". The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, which is currently expected to be followed by a 21 month transition phase before the longer term post-Brexit system kicks in. Reality Check: The government's customs options Tory MPs warned over 'botched' Brexit Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Ministers are currently considering two options to replace the existing customs union with the EU, which involves minimal checks, and which the government is committed to leaving. Brexiteers are sceptical about what is believed to be Theresa May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", under which the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the country. Their proposed alternative ""maximum facilitation"" proposal would rely on technology and advance verification to minimise, rather than remove, customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. During questioning by the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Thompson said that if ministers opted for the ""max fac"" solution this could cost UK and European businesses between Â£17bn and Â£20bn each year, reflecting the cost of customs declarations and complying with rules of origin requirements. At the moment, UK firms exporting to other EU countries or importing goods from the continent are not routinely required to complete goods declaration forms. Those doing business outside the EU must provide information about the type and value of goods, their destination and their tariff classification so that the right amount of VAT, duty or excise is paid. May defends customs Brexit 'backstop' Brexit customs plan has 'flaws' - Gove HMRC: No need for new border checkpoints Mr Thompson said there were about 200 million exports to the EU each year that could require customs declarations  - and a similar number of imports. Citing research by the University of Nottingham business school and by KPMG, he said the likely cost of individual declarations was between Â£20 and Â£55 - and while an average could not be authoritatively calculated, ministers had been advised a figure of Â£32.50 was plausible. Payments on either side of the border could cost Â£13bn a year in total while it was ""reasonable"" to assume any rules of origin requirements demanded by the EU could add ""several billion pounds"". ""You need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between Â£17bn and Â£20bn,"" he said. ""And the primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations."" In contrast, he said the customs partnership option - which has been described as ""crazy"" by Boris Johnson and ""flawed"" by Michael Gove - would cost business a maximum of Â£3.4bn a year - depending on how much firms chose to claim back in differential tariffs. It would, he said, take between three to five years to fully implement any new system after Brexit. A ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. While a ""functioning border"" was possible by the end of the transition period it would not be, in his opinion, be ""fully optimal"". But he said no new customs infrastructure would be needed in Northern Ireland. Mr Thompson declined to answer when it was suggested it would be easier if the UK just remained in the customs union - a solution favoured by business but rejected by ministers. Former Conservative cabinet minister John Redwood said the starting point for any new customs system should be existing arrangements for importing goods from outside the EU. ""We have a perfectly good functioning trade system with the rest of the world at the moment,"" he said. ""It does not cost anything like these figures."" The UK, he said, already had a VAT, excise and currency border with the EU based on pre-registration and electronic declarations which, if necessary, could be extended. ""None of these happen physically at the border any more with a man or a woman in a kiosk having to work it out with the lorry waiting. ""It is all done electronically away from the border with electronic manifests and computer registration... If we have to do customs dues as well it is not a greater increase in the complexity.""

"This video can not be played Michael Rotondo: ""They said you need to get a job"" A New York couple have won their legal battle to evict their 30-year-old son from home after he refused to leave. During a hearing at the state's highest court in Syracuse, a judge praised Michael Rotondo's legal research, but ordered him to leave the house anyway. Justice Donald Greenwood told the son his bid to remain in his parents' home another six months was ""outrageous"". But Mr Rotondo, who legally represented himself, said it was the eviction notice that was outrageous. ""I don't see why they can't just, you know, wait a little bit for me to leave the house,"" Mr Rotondo argued, as his parents looked on, sitting with their lawyer. He said six months was ""a reasonable amount of time for someone who has been depending on persons for support"". Christina and Mark Rotondo were in court The smiling judge urged him to speak to his parents, and to voluntarily leave the house, but Mr Rotondo refused. ""I want you out of that household,"" Judge Greenwood told him, according to ABC News. In a court filing last week, Christina and Mark Rotondo described issuing several orders for their son to move out, starting on 2 February 2018. ""There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you,"" they wrote in one note, dated 18 February. ""Get one - you have to work!"" Mr Rotondo says his parents told him he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job They also gave him $1,100 (Â£819) to leave, according to one letter, which suggested he sell some of his belongings including a broken-down Volkswagen Passat. ""I was originally hoping to give it back,"" he later told CBS outside the family home.

In court he acknowledged he has never contributed to household chores. After Tuesday's hearing, Mr Rotondo summoned news cameras into a hallway for an impromptu press conference. He told reporters he would appeal against the ruling, and that he had planned to move out of the home in Camillius, New York within three months anyway. The home near Syracuse, New York that is at the centre of the family dispute He said that his relationship with his parents has grown very strained, with the three of them never speaking or interacting inside the home. ""After a while it just kind of beats itself down to where there's nothing left,"" he said. When asked how he can manage to avoid them, and whether he lives in a basement, he replied that he lives in a bedroom but did not want to provide more detail. Mr Rotondo said that his parents said he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job. He added that he has a job, but refused to answer questions about it, telling reporters that ""my business is my business"". Mr Rotondo also complained the judge had not properly read his case. He left court, presumably heading back to his parents' home.

"Water-resistant sunscreen products work much less well after they have been worn in the sea, a consumer group has warned ahead of the summer holiday season. Which? tested two products claiming to be water resistant and found the sun protection factor (SPF) dropped by up to 59% after 40 minutes in salt water. Cancer Research UK welcomed the study, warning no sunscreen is 100% effective. But a group representing sunscreen makers called the research alarmist. Current UK tests allow manufacturers to claim a sunscreen is water resistant if the SPF drops by as much as 50% after two 20-minute periods of immersion. The tests are carried out using tap water. However, Which? said its more rigorous tests in salt water, chlorinated water and fast moving water - conditions typically found on holidays - exposed ""serious flaws"" in the testing regime. It said the SPF of one well-known international sunscreen dived by 59% after 40 minutes of immersion. Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? How do sunscreens and lotions protect us? And a popular own-branded product fell by 34%. ""In reality, sun protection is likely to drop even further - factors such as reflection from water, heat, light, sweat, towelling and rubbing all reduce the protection of sunscreens,"" Which? said. Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight is the main preventable cause of skin cancer, according to the charity Cancer Research UK. However, the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) said Which?'s findings were flawed and consumers should have confidence in water-resistant sunscreens. Its director-general Dr Chris Flower, a chartered biologist, said current testing methods worked well. ""In fact an SPF 30 product will stop approximately 96% of UV rays reaching the skin and after robust water resistance testing the product will still filter out at least 93% of the sun's UV rays,"" he said. ""This is clearly not the dramatic reduction in efficacy that Which? implies."" Which? called for tougher regulations like those in the US and Australia, where the SPF on a product's label must be the SPF it provides after immersion. It added that UK water-resistance tests were ""unrealistic to the point of being meaningless"". Cancer Research UK says it is essential when using sunscreen to put plenty of it on ""to get the protection listed on the bottle"". It advises holidaymakers to: Reapply creams regularly Cool off in the shade rather than rely on sunscreen alone Protect skin with a T-shirt and a hat How does sunscreen work?

"Northern said the strike meant any services that ran would be ""extremely busy"" Rail passengers face disruption as Northern staff stage a 24-hour strike, days after travel chaos when new timetables were introduced. RMT union members at Northern are striking for 24 hours on Thursday in an ongoing dispute about safety involving driver-only operated trains. The union said Northern had declared ""war on passengers"". Northern called for ""meaningful"" talks and said the majority of trains running would be between 07:00 and 19:00 BST. The firm faced widespread criticism over cancellations, delays and the implementation of a new timetable on Monday. The government announced urgent plans to deal with Northern's ""poor performance"", which the transport secretary Chris Grayling will discuss with leaders from the north of England later. Northern rail 'number one priority' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes More strike dates in train guard row The meeting comes as Thursday's strike from 00:01 to 23:59 BST is set to be followed by similar action on Saturday. A spokesman for Northern said it expected the ""trains and any replacement buses we operate to be extremely busy"". Passengers have been told to allow extra time for journeys, ""plan carefully and consider whether travel is necessary"". The majority of available trains would run between 07:00 and 19:00 to get people ""into work and home again"", Northern said. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said Northern's passengers ""have had a torrid time recently and these strikes will mean yet more cancelled plans and disrupted journeys"". ""It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to resolve this matter without bringing the railway to a standstill,"" he added. RMT members have staged several previous walkouts over the driver-only issue The latest strikes are going ahead as Northern ""refuse point blank to engage in talks"", according to RMT general secretary Mick Cash. He said the operator had shown it was ""not capable of running a railway"" and had declared ""war on passengers and staff in the drive for increased profits"". The union said passenger safety would be put at risk by getting rid of guards and extending driver-only services and has been in dispute with five operators for more than two years. Northern's deputy manager director Richard Allan said it was ""disappointing"" the union had targeted the bank holiday weekend and ""the first week of the new timetable"". ""We urge RMT to move away from its nationally co-ordinated strikes and allow its local representatives to engage in meaningful discussions with us on how we better serve customers.""
