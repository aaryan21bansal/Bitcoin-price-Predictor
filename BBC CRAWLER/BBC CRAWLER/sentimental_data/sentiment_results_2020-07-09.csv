"The vast majority of emissions cuts from electric cars will be wiped out by new road-building, a report says. The government says vehicle emissions per mile will fall as zero-emissions cars take over Britainâs roads. But the report says the 80% of the CO2 savings from clean cars will be negated by the Â£27bn planned roads programme. It adds that if ministers want a âgreen recoveryâ the cash would be better spent on public transport, walking, cycling, and remote-working hubs. And they point out that the electric cars will continue to increase local air pollution throughparticles eroding from brakes and tyres.,external The calculations have been made by an environmental consultancy, Transport for Quality of Life, using data collected by Highways England. Get Britain building, says Sunak on infrastructure Electric car emissions myth 'busted' The paper estimates that a third of the predicted increase in emissions would come from construction - including energy for making steel, concrete and asphalt. A third would be created by increased vehicle speeds on faster roads. And a further third would be caused by extra traffic generated by new roads stimulating more car-dependent housing, retail parks and business parks. Its authors say history shows that building roads almost always generates more traffic. The report says even with the governmentâs most optimistic estimate of the adoption rate for electric vehicles, emissions from trunk roads and motorways in England are not on track to meet ânet zeroâ by 2050. A government spokesperson told BBC News the report is based on old data. âThis assessment is wholly incorrect and doesnât take into account the benefits from the massive surge in electric vehicles,"" he said. ""The Road Investment Strategy is consistent with our ambition to improve air quality and decarbonise transport."" The reportâs lead author, Lynn Sloman, said the electric car revolution would happen too slowly for transport to achieve the UK's carbon-cutting goals. âIf we are to meet the legally-binding carbon budgets, we need to make big cuts in carbon emissions over the next decade,"" she said. ""That will require faster adoption of electric cars - but it will also require us to reduce vehicle mileage by existing cars. âUnfortunately, the Governmentâs Â£27 billion road programme will make things worse, not better.â The government acceptsthat overall mileage should be cut. But it says the impact of the new roads programme on emissions will be a fraction of the reportâs predicted figure. The AA president, Edmund King, supports some road-building. He told BBC News said: âWe believe post-lockdown that more people will continue to work from home,drive less and cycle and walk more. âBut even with investment in broadband and active travel, we will still need road investment - particularly to overcome the congestion hotspots to help get our goods to market.â Ms Sloman, who works regularly as a consultant for the Department for Transport, responded: âMore roads just mean more cars. Decades of road investment have not solved congestion. âSustained lobbying for more money for roads, leaving less for public transport, cycling and walking, is one of the reasons we now face a climate emergency. We canât afford any more to indulge this Toad of Toad Hall model of mindless road-building.â She also says the government can't ignore the continuing air pollution that will be caused by particles from the brakes and tyres of electric cars. This pollution could actually be increased if the fashion for heavy battery-powered SUVs continues. Ms Sloman said: ""This is an institutional problem. There are people in the Department for Transport and Highways England who have built their careers on big road building budgets, and they won't easily give them up. âBut there are also some officials - and perhaps some politicians - who are starting to recognise that the climate emergency means we need a radically different approach to transport."" The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a decarbonisation strategy, and will publish its plan later in the year.

"Armed police arrived on the scene within two minutes The man who was the first stabbing victim of the Glasgow hotel knife attacker has told the BBC he thought he was going to die. Max Aubin was among six people stabbed by asylum seeker Badreddin Abadlla Adam at the city's Park Inn in West George Street on 26 June. He said he had seen Adam before but had never spoken to him until he called him over and then knifed him twice. But although he came close to death, Mr Aubin says he has already forgiven him. Speaking to the BBC, the 20-year-old, who would like to become a criminal lawyer, said that Friday started like any other day. He said: ""I was in my room when my friend Dante messaged me saying he needs tobacco. I said I would meet him outside. Badreddin Abadlla Adam carried out multiple stabbings in Glasgow ""I was late to meet him so he had started to returned to his hotel. I saw him and shouted him to come back. ""Then I heard the guy (Adam) say 'hey you' and I was surprised because it was the first time he had talked to me. He didn't talk to anyone. He said 'Can I see you?'"". Concerns over asylum hotel plan ahead of incident Glasgow stabbings: What we know Suspect family 'shocked and saddened' Mr Aubin said he thought he might need his help. He put his hand out to shake Adam's hand but he blocked it and he slapped him on the head. He said: ""It was real quick, he slapped me, I started to panic and he started to stab me - two seconds, so quick. ""I felt something on my body but I didn't see the knife. I went to go to the ground but he grabbed my t-shirt and tried to stab me again. When I went to run, my t-shirt ripped and I looked to find Dante. ""He stabbed me on both sides. I didn't feel pain but when I saw the blood I realised he had stabbed me."" The incident sparked a major police operation in the city centre After Mr Aubin was attacked, he said he heard someone screaming, in a stairwell, but he did not see it. He remembers looking down and seeing that he was bleeding. ""When I saw my blood I thought I would die. ""My eyes wanted to close. But in my mind I thought, if I close my eyes I will die, so I fought to stay awake."" Both men were among 100 asylum seekers moved to the hotel during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Aubin, from the Ivory Coast, had been in Scotland for just 20 days when he found himself at the centre of one of the city's biggest police operations, sparked by reports of ""armed attacks"" at the city centre hotel. The 28-year-old Sudanese attacker was shot dead by police, but not before he stabbedPC David Whyteand five other casualties, including two members of hotel staff and three asylum seekers. PC David Whyte was treated in hospital for serious injuries Mr Aubin says he was well looked after in hospital and although he still feels pain, he says it is improving every day. But he keeps reliving the attack in his mind. He said: ""When I remember, I take my bible and I start to pray. I am a Christian."" Mr Aubin said he feels very lucky to be alive and he does not blame Adam for what happened to him. ""I thank the Lord every morning that I am alive. It was just a bad day. ""He is dead but I prayed for him. It wasn't him, I think maybe he was sick. ""We have to forgive him. I am alive and once the doctor said I would be okay, I prayed for him. ""I forgave him already. I was just worried for the police officer."" Despite going through such a traumatic event, Mr Aubin still believes Glasgow is a ""nice city"". He said: ""It is not the city, it was the one man. I was unlucky.""

"The government's LGBT Action Plan promised in 2018 it would ban 'conversion therapy' Instagram and parent company Facebook will block the promotion of ""conversion therapy"", which tries to change a person's sexuality or gender identity, the social media firm has told the BBC. Campaigners are urging the government to act now on a two-year-old promise to make the practice illegal. This year, 200,000 people have signed an online petition calling for action. All major UK therapy professional bodies and the NHS oppose it on logical, ethical and moral grounds. Luke, 23, is gay and a youth worker who was raised in a strict Christian family in north-west England. ""In school I had quite a feminine voice, and feminine behaviour, and I was bullied because of it,"" he told  the BBC. ""I guess my dad knew the potential gay signs before I did, because he would force me to do stereotypically boyish things, which I hated. He knew I hated sports, but he didn't care, as long as his boy seemed less gay."" At 13, Luke's dad saw his internet search history on the family computer, which included forums for gay teens and gay pornography. ""When my dad scrolled through, he was physically sick. He took me to my youth pastor's house. I had been attending his church since birth, and he had always been so nice to me, which probably made this worse, because I completely trusted him."" Luke says he was made to feel dirty and disgusting for liking boys. His deeply religious family was determined to use him as an example for his wider community. ""Over a couple of years, my family and the church team totally damaged me. Beatings, exorcisms, fasting, online courses, everything."" ""They told me I was born straight but I had been damaged by my parents divorcing. They would put their hands on my head and tell me how evil I am. They would ask me to describe how I felt when I saw a guy I fancied on TV. I said I felt excited but a bit naughty, and they'd say that they were feelings from the Devil."" ""The worst thing is, I was grateful for their torture. My only goal was to be straight like everyone else in the world. I would say thank you to them after they abused me."" The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or to suppress a person's gender identity. While some violent practices which may be classed as conversion therapy, such as ""corrective rape"", are already covered by existing criminal offences, many religious practices, such as those experienced by Luke, are not. Puberty eventually made Luke's voice lower and he became more reserved, but inside, he still ""felt gay"". After attempting to take his life, another of Luke's pastors encouraged a more lenient approach. Luke was told that ""gay temptation"" is not in his control, but ""gay behaviour"" is, so as long as he didn't act on his urges, he could ""live a normal life"". Luke eventually fled to London. He has never returned to his hometown, but his family has since apologised over Facebook. Crying, Luke said that speaking to the BBC about his experiences made him realise how awful his teenage years were. In 2018, the government announced that ""gay conversion therapies"" were to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people, but activists are still waiting for action. The government has since said it will ""consider all options for ending the practice"". The new president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Adrian James, said: ""Any intervention purporting to 'treat' something which is not a disorder is wholly unethical and should be banned."" Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Tara Hopkins, EMEA public policy director, Instagram, said the company is changing the way it handles conversion therapy content. ""We don't allow attacks against people based on sexual orientation or gender identity and are updating our policies to ban the promotion of conversion therapy services."" She continued: ""We are always reviewing our policies and will continue to consult with experts and people with personal experiences to inform our approach."" Earlier this year, Facebook and Instagram banned the promotion of conversion therapy in ads, where people don't choose what they see. From Friday, any content linked to it will now be banned across both it and Facebook. The company stresses that it will take time to update all of its policies to reflect this blanket ban, so while some content that users flag may not immediately be removed, overtime that should change. In a letter to the government, seen by the BBC and signed by celebrities and charities, Ban Conversion Therapy calls for conversion therapy ""finally"" to be made illegal. Signatories include Dua Lipa, Elton John, Stephen Fry and Jade Thirlwall. The new organisation, started by friends Harry Hitchens and Matthew Hyndman, has already attracted thousands of views on social media and has been backed by Stonewall, Europe's largest LGBT charity. Since posting a now-viral post on Instagram about conversion therapy still being legal in the UK, Harry received personal threats and hate messages from groups who found his address. ""So many people didn't know that conversion therapy is still legal in the UK, and every time a celebrity shared my post, there was another 24 hours of hate."" ""I received messages like 'you should've hid your address better, [expletive], we're coming to get you'. I haven't had the energy to report any of it to the police yet. I just wanted to hide from it all."" Ban Conversion Therapy is a new organisation set up by Matthew Hyndman (left) and Harry Hitchens (right) Matthew says the motivations for starting his organisation stemmed from his own religious experiences and a near miss with ""conversion therapy"". ""I grew up in rural Northern Ireland. There was a great sense of community, and it was very religious. I was in complete denial that I was gay."" While working as a missionary, Matthew was outed as gay. After refusing to publicly confess his ""sins"" and go through ""counselling"" he was eventually told he could no longer be a member of his church. ""The church can be a wonderful place. They support people to do a lot of good in the world. No matter whether the reason is religious or otherwise, to counsel someone to change their sexuality or gender identity is wrong. The UN has declared conversion therapy as torture. Are we happy to condone torture?"" ""We are writing to urge you to introduce a truly effective ban on conversion therapy for all lesbian, gay, bi, trans and gender diverse people in the UK,"" Ban Conversion's letter states. ""Any form of counselling or persuading someone to change their sexual orientation or gender identity should be illegal, no matter the reason, religious or otherwise - whatever the person's age."" Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner wants conversion therapy banned immediately However, some people who counsel LGBT people in a supportive environment are concerned that a blanket ban of conversion therapy could lead to issues. One therapist who spoke to the BBC is concerned that if the government does ban conversion therapy, they will not be able to treat their trans clients without fear of being arrested. The therapist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of ""losing"" their career, said their work helping trans individuals come to terms with their acquired gender is legal and encouraged them to get Gender Recognition Certificates but it could be classed by critics as ""conversion therapy"". ""Where do we draw the line? Everybody agrees that conversion therapy is bad, but nobody knows how to define it,"" said the therapist. Senior faith leader Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner ""completely disagrees."" ""It's a lie to call it therapy. It's not - what we're talking about banning is brainwashing."" ""There is a clear distinction between a therapist saying 'let's work together to see what's best for you' and them saying: 'I think you should be this.'"" Rabbi Janner-Klausner is a member of the newly formed Inter-religious Advisory Board on LGBT for the Ozanne Foundation, which works with religious organisations around the world to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender. ""From where I stand as a religious leader, conversion therapy needs to be banned immediately. Anyone within my religion practicing this is wrong, and needs to be stopped. I don't want a state that starts restricting people's prayer, that's frightening, but if someone misuses their authority to get someone else to change, that's an abuse of power.""

"The BBC is to go ahead with a plan to end free TV licences for most over-75s, after a two-month delay because of the coronavirus pandemic. That means more than three million households will be asked to start paying the Â£157.50 fee from 1 August. Only those who receive the Pension Credit benefit will be exempt. The BBC said the new scheme is ""the fairest decision"", but the government said it was ""the wrong decision"" and Age UK called it ""a kick in the teeth"". The controversial change was originally due to be made on 1 June, and the BBC said the delay had cost Â£35m a month. The cost of continuing to provide free licences to all over-75s could have reached Â£1bn a year over time with an ageing population, according to the corporation. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? BBC Chairman Sir David Clementi said the decision had ""not been easy"", but the broadcaster is under ""under severe financial pressure"" and a further delay would have had an impact on programmes. Actor Ricky Tomlinson led a protest outside the BBC's MediaCity in Salford last June BBC delays over-75 TV licence fee changes The BBC has previously warned that making no changes would have led to ""unprecedented closures"" of services. It has also previously saidit must make an extra Â£125m savings this year as a result of the pandemic, including the cost of delaying the over-75s changes. Free TV licences for the over-75s have been provided by the government since 2000, but responsibility for the provision was passed to the BBC as part of its last licence fee settlement. The Age UK charity said it was ""bitterly disappointed"", describing the move as ""a kick in the teeth for millions of over-75s who have had a torrid time during this crisis"". More than 630,000 people signed an Age UK petition when the BBC first announced the plan in 2019. The charity has now urged the BBC and the government to ""urgently sit down and agree on a solution to keep TV licences free"". Allow Twitter content?

Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said many older people would either have to give up their TV, which is ""more of a lifeline than ever"", or other essential purchases. ""Everyone needs to understand that under the BBC's scheme many hundreds of thousands of the poorest pensioners will be facing a bill they will simply be unable to afford to pay,"" she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the BBC had made the ""wrong decision"", and the government believes the licence fees in question ""should be funded by the BBC"".

For the government to blame the BBC who are having to contend with huge cuts is simply passing the buck.""

Broadcaster and Labour peer Dame Joan Bakewell said some older people could and should pay - but there is a ""suffering middle"" who will struggle. ""The rich old have lots of savings and investments, and they can well afford it,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. But she added: ""Not enough will get it free. There are layers of people above the earning [level] that gets you the benefit who also should be allowed to have a free licence fee... It's the suffering middle who perhaps find life expensive but are not reduced to needing state benefits."" She added that she had hoped incoming director general Tim Davie could have brought ""some original thinking"" to find a better solution. The BBC said there would be a ""Covid-safe"" payment system, meaning people can apply online, and there will be a dedicated phone line and support staff. ""No-one needs to take any immediate action, or leave their home, to claim for a free TV licence or pay for one,"" a statement said. TV Licensing will write to all licence holders aged over 75 with clear guidance about how to pay, it said.

"Leisure facilities and beauty services in England will be allowed to reopen, the government has announced. Pools, gyms, nail bars and tattooists will be able to open their doors again, and team sports - starting with cricket - will be allowed to resume. Announcing the changes at a briefing at No 10, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged people to ""work out to help out"". Outdoor performances will also be able to resume with limited audiences. It came as the UK reported the deaths of a further 85 people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 44,602. Mr Dowden said ""all the data"" was continuing to ""move in the right direction"" despite the reopening of pubs and restaurants last weekend. Outdoor concerts, plays and opera get government go-ahead Why haven't nail bars, gyms and pools been open? 'It's a great feeling to have gyms back again' He said normal life was ""slowly returning"" and that this was an important milestone for the country's performers and artists, who had been ""waiting in the wings since March"". ""I'm really urging people to get out there and to play their part,"" he said. ""Buy the tickets for outdoor plays and musical recitals, get to your local gallery and support your local businesses."" But the culture secretary warned the measures were conditional and reversible, adding that the government would impose local lockdowns if cases started to spike. This video can not be played Dowden: 'We need to get the nation match fit to defeat this disease' What will reopen when? Outdoor pools and outdoor theatres will be able to reopen from Saturday 11 July Grassroots sport will be able to return from this coming weekend, beginning with cricket Beauticians, tattooists, spas, tanning salons and other close-contact services can reopen""subject to some restrictions on particularly high-risk services""from 13 July Indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities can reopen from 25 July Singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments will be allowed in professional environments and Mr Dowden said specific scientific studies on the risks had been commissioned Small pilots of indoor performances, with socially distanced audiences, will also take place to help work out the best way for them to restart Not all forms of beauty treatment will be able to go ahead, assome are deemed too high-risk. These include face waxing, sugaring or threading services, facial treatments, make-up application and eyebrow treatments. Vanita Parti, chief executive of walk-in beauty chain Blink Brow Bar, said that at first she had welcomed the news but then she received an email from the British Beauty Council telling herno treatments to the face would be allowed. ""I'm furious. We can't reopen,"" she said. ""This will kill so many businesses."" Guidance for the reopening of sports facilities,externalhas been published, including on cleaning regimes, social distancing and protection for staff. Measures include limiting the number of people using a facility at one time, reducing class sizes and spacing out equipment. Face coverings will not be mandatory in gyms. Small numbers of supporters will be able to watch outdoor sports, provided social distancing measures and group size rules are followed. Each sport will have to submit an action plan to the government of how it will operate safely, with sports where a single ball is used having to show how they can reduce the risk of it transmitting the virus. The government said a team led by England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam had been visiting sports sites to see the sector's preparations to reopen safely. When put to him that the restrictions would make exercise ""less fun"", Mr Dowden said people would get used to the new measures. He said: ""The judgment we've taken with this [pubs] and swimming pools and elsewhere is it is better to reopen with those restrictions than not reopen at all.""

"The Welsh Government said the Â£29m would target disadvantaged pupils and those studying for exams Nine-hundred extra teaching posts are to be created as part of a Â£29m support package to help pupils catch up when they return to school. The Welsh Government said it would pay for the equivalent of 600 teachers and 300 teaching assistants for a year. It will target disadvantaged pupils and those taking exams, and could include extra coaching and learning resources. Head teachers' union NAHT welcomed the announcement, saying it was vital to invest in the next generation. Education Minister Kirsty Williams will later reveal whether pupils will return to full-time education in September. The Welsh Government said newly qualified teachers and supply teachers would take up the majority of the posts, and will be on one-year contracts. Thousands want September full-time school return School reopening plans needed, union says What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales? In secondary schools, support will be focused on pupils studying for exams in Years 11, 12 and 13, as well as pupils of all ages who receive free schools meals, have additional learning needs or who are identified as being vulnerable. Learning resources are promised to help new and current teachers deliver support to pupils studying for exams, which could include personalised learning programmes and additional lessons. A range of teaching approaches will be used, the government said, including ""blended learning"" - a mix of learning from home and limited face-to-face teaching. Schools reopened in a limited capacity on 29 June Details are to follow about how the money will be shared between schools, it added. Ms Williams said the government was supporting schools in the ""recovery phase"" and would continue to raise standards. ""This extra investment and targeted support will ensure that the impact of time away from school over recent months is minimised,"" she said. ""This is not a short-term fix. I am guaranteeing this money, extra staff and support for the whole of next year."" The announcement comes as Ms Williams is due to set out plans for how schools will operate in the new term. Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she wants to ""maximise"" face-to-face contact between pupils and teachers She told a Senedd committee on Tuesday that her goal was to ""maximise"" face-to-face contact between pupils and teachers. It suggests the minister could adopt similar plans to those proposed in other parts of the UK planning for the full-time return of pupils after the summer.

"Two of the UK's biggest High Street retailers, John Lewis and Boots, have announced 5,300 job cuts. Boots has said 4,000 jobs will go, while John Lewis is shutting down eight stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. The moves come amid warnings thatnew economic support from Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill not be enough to stop millions of workers losing their jobs. Mr Sunak admitted thathe would not be able to protect ""every single job""as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". Boots is consulting on plans to cut head office and store teams and shut 48 of its more than 600 Boots Opticians practices. It has not yet said which outlets will close, but about 7% of its workforce will lose their jobs. John Lewis said department stores in Birmingham and Watford will not reopen as the coronavirus lockdown eases. It also plans to shut down its At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth and travel sites at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras. Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' How is furlough changing? Mr Sunak unveiled a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at saving jobs, including a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee retained to the end of January 2021. He also announced measures to benefit the hospitality sector, includinggiving diners 50% off eating out from Monday to Wednesday in August. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves to support restaurants, pubs and cafes could also help retail. ""We very much hope that when people go to their local pub or their restaurant to eat out, those are often in the centre of towns, hopefully that will encourage the footfall to those areas so we get more people going to our shops as well,"" Mr Dowden said, speaking after announcing the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and outdoor theatres. John Lewis says some of its stores were in trouble before the virus struck, while Boots already had plans for a shake-up. The crisis has forced them to speed up efforts to deal with the rise of internet shopping. And just now they face the phasing out of the government-supported furlough scheme, starting next month. One by one, retailers are revealing how many staff they will bring back into stores as the job subsidy is withdrawn. Most Boots outlets remained open throughout the lockdown to provide pharmacy and healthcare services, but the firm said footfall had ""dramatically reduced"". The firm said sales across all Boots UK outlets were down 50% in the third quarter, and some 70% at Boots Opticians. ""Restrictions are beginning to lift, but with an uncertain economic outlook, it is anticipated that the High Street will take considerable time to recover,"" it said. Boots said last year that it was reviewing the size of its UK operationswith the possibility that up to 200 stores could be closed. The managing director of Boots UK, Sebastian James, described the latest cuts as ""decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan"". John Lewis said the eight stores affected were already ""financially challenged"" even before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 had caused customers to move more quickly towards online shopping and away from stores. John Lewis Partnership chairwoman Sharon White said: ""Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today's announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners. ""However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership - and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop."" Ms White said John Lewis would do everything it could to keep on as many people as possible. John Lewis had warned in March it could close shopsas a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. Former John Lewis boss Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands, said the closure of the chain's flagship Birmingham store was ""deeply disappointing"". ""At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one which I believe risks being a dreadful mistake,""he tweeted,external. He added that his belief in its potential was ""unwavering"" and that he would be making the case for it to stay open. The planned closure of John Lewis's Watford store has prompteda petition to save it,external, which has been signed by 4,400 people so far. Other John Lewis customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""With no modification to the jobs retention scheme, that dreaded October cliff-edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. ""Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace."" Vivienne King, chief executive at Revo, which represents the retail property sector, warned that three million retail jobs remained in jeopardy unless the government undertook ""a fundamental review of business rates and direct financial support to underwrite rents"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak himself told BBC Breakfast: ""Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs? Yes, and the scale of this is significant. ""We are entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen. That is of course going to have a significant impact on unemployment and on job losses."" Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said the job cuts were ""deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots"" and described Mr Sunak's statement as ""a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it"".

"This video can not be played Trump: Supreme Court ruling a 'witch hunt' and 'hoax' The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump's financial records can be examined by prosecutors in New York. In a related case, the court ruled that this information did not have to be shared with Congress. Mr Trump has come under fire for not making his tax returns public like his predecessors. His lawyers had argued that he enjoyed total immunity while in office and that Congress had no valid justification to seek the records. How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book Two Democratic-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - had demanded Mr Trump's tax documents over several years in order to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were tough enough. Mr Trump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"". ""The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution,""he wrote in a series of tweets following the court rulings.,external In the case regarding the request from the New York prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled by a majority of seven to two that the president did not have absolute immunity from criminal investigation. ""Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,"" the court said. ""We reaffirm that principle today."" But the two cases regarding Congressional committees were closely watched, as they could have had implications on how far US lawmakers could scrutinise the activities of a sitting president. The court ruled that Congress had significant, but not limitless, power to request the president's personal information. In this case, the court returned the case to the lower courts. Those wanting to see President Donald Trump's tax returns before the November presidential election shouldn't hold their breath. In a series of high-stakes rulings on Thursday, the US Supreme Court swatted down the president's defence that, by dint of his high office, he was somehow above the law when it came to state-level criminal subpoenas. That's good news for the president's critics, advocates of limited executive power, and New York prosecutors seeking to investigate Trump's personal finances. The opinion is not-so-good news for anyone wanting a quick resolution to this case, however. Chief Justice John Roberts sent the lawsuit back down to the lower courts and offered a few new legal avenues for Mr Trump's lawyers to pursue that could continue to put off a day when the president's accounting firm ultimately hands over the documents. And if that day comes, there's still no guarantee that the request, by a secret grand jury, will ever lead to a public disclosure. In the other case, involving a request by congressional Democrats for Mr Trump's financial records, the court was even more circumspect. It simply punted the case down to the lower court with instructions to further balance presidential privileges with legislative power. The gears of justice will grind even more slowly there. While legally these decisions may have been, at best, a draw for the president, by pushing the final day of reckoning further down the road, it's a political win. Two of the cases centred on the ability of the House intelligence, oversight and financial services committees to compel Deutsche Bank and Mazars USA, Mr Trump's long-time accounting firm, to turn over his tax and financial documents. The committees argued that they needed this information to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were sufficiently rigorous. The case of Trump v Vance was based on on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's criminal subpoena - an order to hand over evidence. Mr Vance argued Mr Trump's documents were needed to determine if financial records had been doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Following the ruling Mr Vance said the investigation into Mr Trump's financial affairs would resume. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she would continue to campaign for Mr Trump's financial records to be handed over to Congress. ""Congress will continue to conduct oversight for the people, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our constitution,"" she told reporters. It is not clear whether this will happen. Even if Mr Trump's financial records are turned over to prosecutors, they may remain hidden from public view until charges are filed.

"There are 11 hectares of workshop space at the Nantgarw site - enough to cover 16 football pitches General Electric is to cut 369 jobs at its aircraft engine maintenance plant in south Wales. GE has been consulting with 1,400 staff at its site in Nantgarw, near Caerphilly, as the firm suffers from the drop of numbers in air travel. The company, which makes jet engines for Boeing and Airbus, blamed the ""unprecedented impact of Covid-19"". It said it remained focused on ""preserving our capability to respond as the industry recovers"". The announcement comes on top of 180 posts already lost at the site since the coronavirus crisis began through voluntary redundancies. Airbus job losses a 'hammer blow' to whole area Hundreds of British Airways jobs under threat Welsh aviation sector needs 'major intervention' ""Today's news from GE is further devastating news for Welsh workers, Welsh manufacturing and the Welsh economy,"" said union leader Peter Hughes, the regional secretary for Unite Wales. ""Our members at GE and their families will be extremely worried about their futures today. ""Unite will stand completely behind our members and will not move an inch from our position that compulsory redundancies must be ruled out."" The union called on GE to pause their plans and ""work with us to seek an urgent UK government sector deal for aerospace that could save these jobs"". Welsh economy minister Ken Skates said his officials would be working to help those affected, but said there needed to be ""immediate and radical action"" from the UK government. ""We have already called for measures to be taken and I am repeating that once again today. Without action from the UK government, the future of the aerospace sector is at serious risk,"" said Mr Skates. ""Other central governments have moved rapidly to protect their industries, the UK government must do the same to safeguard a sector which is vital to our economy."" The UK government has been approached for comment. GE Aviation employs 1,400 at its aircraft engine maintenance plant in Nantgarw The Labour MP for Pontypridd Alex Davies-Jones and her Senedd counterpart Mick Antoniw said it was an ""absolutely devastating"" announcement. They said it was ""particularly distressing"" that the majority of GE's UK job cuts would fall on the Nantgarw site.Â ""These are highly-skilled, highly-paid jobs and will be extremely difficult to replace,"" they said. It follows job cuts atBritish Airways in south Walesand the announcement of1,435 redundancies at Airbusin Broughton in Flintshire. Ms Davies-Jones and Mr Antoniw added: ""The UK aerospace industry is in crisis and it is not acceptable for the UK government to simply sit back and shrug its shoulders. ""We will continue to work with Unite the union and GE management locally to do everything we can to ensure that as many jobs as possible are retained for the future and to support those who have lost their jobs in any way we can."" The Conservative's business spokesman in the Senedd, Russell George, said: ""If these reports are accurate, then it is clearly going to be very worrying news for the employees at the GE Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in south Wales, during what are already very uncertain times, and it follows similar recent announcements by aviation firms with operations in Wales."" He said his party would do ""all we can"" to deal with the impact, including working cross-party with the Welsh Government. Plaid Cymru's South East Wales Senedd member Delyth Jewell called on the Welsh Government to look at investing in the ""green economy"". ""I fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg, we will see with job losses over the coming weeks and months, which is why I urge the Welsh Government to heed Plaid Cymru's call for an All-Wales Renewal Fund to help boost sectors that are hardest hit by the crisis,"" she said.

"Leisure facilities and beauty services in England will be allowed to reopen, the government has announced. Pools, gyms, nail bars and tattooists will be able to open their doors again, and team sports - starting with cricket - will be allowed to resume. Announcing the changes at a briefing at No 10, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged people to ""work out to help out"". Outdoor performances will also be able to resume with limited audiences. It came as the UK reported the deaths of a further 85 people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 44,602. Mr Dowden said ""all the data"" was continuing to ""move in the right direction"" despite the reopening of pubs and restaurants last weekend. Outdoor concerts, plays and opera get government go-ahead Why haven't nail bars, gyms and pools been open? 'It's a great feeling to have gyms back again' He said normal life was ""slowly returning"" and that this was an important milestone for the country's performers and artists, who had been ""waiting in the wings since March"". ""I'm really urging people to get out there and to play their part,"" he said. ""Buy the tickets for outdoor plays and musical recitals, get to your local gallery and support your local businesses."" But the culture secretary warned the measures were conditional and reversible, adding that the government would impose local lockdowns if cases started to spike.

These include face waxing, sugaring or threading services, facial treatments, make-up application and eyebrow treatments. Vanita Parti, chief executive of walk-in beauty chain Blink Brow Bar, said that at first she had welcomed the news but then she received an email from the British Beauty Council telling herno treatments to the face would be allowed. ""I'm furious. We can't reopen,"" she said. ""This will kill so many businesses."" Guidance for the reopening of sports facilities,externalhas been published, including on cleaning regimes, social distancing and protection for staff. Measures include limiting the number of people using a facility at one time, reducing class sizes and spacing out equipment. Face coverings will not be mandatory in gyms. Small numbers of supporters will be able to watch outdoor sports, provided social distancing measures and group size rules are followed. Each sport will have to submit an action plan to the government of how it will operate safely, with sports where a single ball is used having to show how they can reduce the risk of it transmitting the virus. The government said a team led by England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam had been visiting sports sites to see the sector's preparations to reopen safely. When put to him that the restrictions would make exercise ""less fun"", Mr Dowden said people would get used to the new measures.

NO Premier League games tomorrow, if you can believe such a thing. But five games on Saturday, spread over four kick-offs from lunchtime until bedtime. As busy as you like. Saturday looks like: Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Robbie SavageEx-Wales midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Jack Grealish is good enough for a top-six side but if you look at the way Manchester United play now - that one-touch passing, the movement, the pace - the big question about Jack is: does he hold on to the ball too long to draw fouls? When you play with better players. you probably move the ball quicker because at Aston Villa, he probably feels like everything here centres around 'Jack Grealish.' He loves the club, he's a supporter, everything is on his shoulders being captain trying to get the club to safety. So, if he moved to a bigger club with better players, he would probably feel the responsibility wouldn't be as great.

That's all from us here on BBC Scotland's live page on Thursday 9 July. Here's a reminder of today's headlines: Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney has vowed to get to the bottom of advice being given to remedial massage therapists. One therapist told Drivetime earlier that she had reopened for business this week on account of advice from the Scottish government only to be told to close last night by national clinical director Jason Leitch. ""I don't know the detail about that but will go away and find out about it,"" Mr Swinney tells host John Beattie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Opening pubs and restaurants has left the Scottish government more nervous now than at any time in its process of easing lockdown, Deputy First Minister John Swinney admits. Asked by Drivetime if he has concerns about pubs, he replies: ""I do. This is the most nervous part of the process we've been in so far because we're opening up parts of society we know have the potential to spread the virus quite significantly simply by the nature of their structure and the interaction between individuals. ""The country has done very well in reducing the incidence of the virus, but a lot of that has been down to the absence of social interaction."" Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News correspondent The first minister is to give the go-ahead for a limited
number of fans to return to sports venues within weeks. Itâs unlikely the new
SPFL Premiership season will kick off at the start of August with gates open to
supporters but test events are likely to be allowed in a bid to get fans back
much quicker than anticipated. The move comes just over a week after government
advisors said it was unlikely fans would be back before October. It is
subject to no resurgence in Corona virus cases and social-distancing measures
being in place. The number of fans allowed for each venue has yet to be
determined. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney has expressed surprise that some private dentists ""are open and drilling"" despite the Scottish government saying that only non-aerosol treatments can move forward in the current phase of lockdown easing. Host John Beattie explains that private dentists claim they can carry out such work because they have appropriate PPE and are not government by NHS restrictions. Promising to ""make sure that is properly examined"", Mr Swinney replies that: ""You are asking me about a level of detail that I can't answer, so I am not going to make any attempt to do so. ""The first minister said today that non-aerosol routine care was able to be taken forward, but essentially the treatment requiring aerosol treatment could not be taken forward, so I am more than a bit surprised to hear that."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland In My Father's Words, a Dundee Rep production went to New York The news that outdoor live events will not be permitted and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres and music venues will remain shut until at least the end of July will have come as no surprise. Liam
Sinclair, co-chair of the
Federation of Scottish Theatre, says the organisation ""broadly welcomes the clarity"" and had been asking for a not-before date. Mr Sinclair, also the joint CEO of Dundee Rep Theatre, says the coming weeks afford ""a window to make sure we get it right"" both in terms of public health and the economics. ""We need a significant number of people in our venues to make them viable,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stricter restrictions were eventually lifted in Annan (pictured), Gretna, Dumfries, Lockerbie, Langholm and Canonbie An assurance has been given that people asked to self-isolate by Scotland's Test and Protect system are doing so following scepticism expressed by a member of the independent SAGE scientific committee. Responding on BBC Radio Scotland to earlier remarks from Prof Allyson Pollock, Deputy First Minister John Swinney refers to the seemingly successful action taken in light of a cluster of infections in Dumfries & Galloway. ""The contract tracers really did a superb job in contacting individuals, they identified who they were, they interviewed them about their contacts and they then went to the contacts and asked those individuals to isolate,"" he says. ""What we then saw from the incident management team that looked at that example was that the were able to confidently assure us that the cluster in Dumfries and Galloway had been contained because they had got to the end of the contract trails of all the individuals involved and all the individuals were complying."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Ducks Inn in Aberlady Hospitality businesses need more clarity about what the requirements will be now that the social distancing rules will be reduced to 1m, the owner of the Ducks Inn Hotel in Aberlady, East Lothian, tells BBC Radio Scotland. Malcolm Duck says he has received conflicting advice from the local council's environmental health department and the police. ""I can't find anything on any website to tell us what we are doing,"" he says. ""We have a lot of work to do to get ready and we need to know the messaging.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney is on Drivetime shortly People in Scotland will be able to visit other households indoors and stay overnightas the country enters the next phase of easing the lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said coronavirus had been suppressed to a ""low level"" andannounced a raft of changes in the coming days. Deputy First Minister John Swinney will be on Drivetime after the news, you can listen with us here on this live page. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Massage therapy continues with PPE in the United States Sports and remedial massage therapist Beth Vance feels let down by the Scottish government after initially being told she could start her business this week only to receive an email last night from national clinical director Jason Leitch saying she had to stop again. She tells BBC Radio Scotland that her parent body, the Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation, had quoted the government saying she could restart because her treatment was for people with chronic pain. ""So I spent the entire weekend getting everything ready,"" she says. That included gathering PPE, infrared thermometers, a risk assessment of her work space, followed by a ""test run on Monday with a friend"". Ms Vance saw paying clients on Tuesday and Wednesday but had to cancel appointments today following Prof Leitch's email. She admits she had originally resigned herself to being allowed to open at the end of this month or start of August along with others like beauty therapists but says: ""I just want the government to be clear about what is happening."" Ms Vance finds it strange that therapists such as herself, who treat patients with conditions like cerebral palsy and multiple scleroris, are unable to work while the government has eased the lockdown for ""people to sit in pubs for up to two hours socialising for the sake having a pint or two"". The Scottish government has been asked to respond. The first minister revealed earlier there were some activities included in phase three of the route map to which we are not yet able to attach a specific date. It should be assumed at this stage
that these other activities will not restart before 31 July, although this will be kept under review: Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Are people self-isolating when being told they have been in contact with someone testing positive for Covid-19? Well, we don't know because we don't have any information on it, argues Allyson Pollock, Professor of Public Health at Newcastle
University and a member of the Independent SAGE committee. Professor Pollock is delighted to see the rate of infections drop in Scotland but says: ""The concern now will be around whether there are enough systems in place to identify cases and outbreaks and to act on them properly. ""We still don't have any information on contacts and if they are isolating when contacted. Or if any of these contacts are becoming cases. The Test and Protect data appears to stop as soon as they've asked people to self-quarantine."" Professor Pollock tells John: ""Staying at home for 14 days is a really big call on people when financial livelihoods are at stake. ""We need to know if people are doing as they've been asked and they are being financially supported and their housing is supported. Some countries go as far as putting people into hotels. ""This is the vital bit of the Test and Protect policy. It's no good finding the contacts and then not quarantining because then they are just spreading the virus.""

Face coverings are becoming more fashionable Don't rely on just one mask or face covering, NHS Grampian's divisional general manager of public health told BBC Radio Scotland earlier today. Face coverings are already mandatory on public transport in Scotland and the same becomes true tomorrow in shops and other enclosed indoor spaces. Jillian Evans pointed out that, as soon as you take off a face covering, you could potentially contaminate it and it should not be used again until it is washed. ""There's not a huge point in just having one mask in your bag that you take off and put on throughout the day,"" she says. ""My advice would be keep the mask on the whole time you are shopping. If you can remain two metres apart during your day, it reduces your need to wear a mask. ""So plan ahead, make sure you have enough masks, keep socially distant where you can, don't put the same mask on again twice."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us today, particularly if you're reading this from a country or city that's currently in lockdown. We'll be pausing this live page shortly - but before we go, here are the day's main global headlines. It's been a busy day, with further lockdown easing announced in England, Wales and Scotland. Here are the main stories: This video can not be played How stand-up comedians went online to survive lockdown With many theatres and live entertainment venues in the UK still closed because of coronavirus, comedians, performers and entertainers have taken to online platforms. In the video above, comedians tell the BBC how they're adjusting to this ""new normal"". It comes ascomedy clubs call for a slice of the government's Â£1.5bn emergency arts funding, with a warning that hundreds face closure within the next year. Comedy was not mentioned when the government announced its bailout package for the arts on Sunday. Chris EwokorBBC News, Abuja The lawsuit accuses China of failing to promptly inform the WHO about the virus An attempt by Nigerian lawyers to get compensation from China for the coronavirus pandemic has been described by Chinese authorities as ""frivolous."" The group of 11 lawyers is demanding $200bn (Â£158bn) in damages for the ""loss of lives, economic strangulation, trauma, hardship, social disorientation, mental torture and disruption of normal daily existence of people in Nigeria"". But the Chinese embassy in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, said the case lacked basis in international law. China has sent medical teams to Nigeria to assist with relief efforts ""Covid-19 has caught the whole world by surprise. China, like other countries, is a victim. Confronted by an unknown virus, we have acted responsibly to protect people's life and health and safeguard global public health,""it said in statement on Twitter,external. The lawyers are trying to persuade Nigeria's government to institute state action against China through the International Court of Justice. Their case is yet to be heard at Nigeria's High Court. Beauticians, nail salons and tattooists can reopen in England from Monday - but Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there will be restrictions on ""particularly high-risk services"". The government confirms those which willnotbe allowed include:  Read more on the detailshere. A 23-year-old man has been executed in China for killing two government workers at a health checkpoint in February. Ma Jianguo stabbed the pair to death at a village in Yunan province in February, after he tried to remove a roadblock set up by local authorities. In a statement, the Supreme People's Court of China said he had recently finished a five-year prison sentence for assault. It's the first confirmed death penalty in China related to the country's efforts to contain coronavirus. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg In an apocalyptic warning, a South African health official suggested that half a million graves were being dug in the province of Gauteng to help cemeteries cope with the wave of coronavirus deaths. Dr Bandile Masuku, head of the province's health authorities, made the announcement during a television interview, but his office quickly explained that the actual number was far smaller. So why mention that figure at all? The general assumption is that he was deliberately seeking to spread alarm in a country where the virus has been slow to spread, and where the public has, as a result, begun to drop its guard. In recent days, the infection rate around Johannesburg has been rising sharply, and hospitals here, and in other big municipalities, are already struggling - with reports of oxygen shortages, a lack of beds, and personal protective equipment. South Africa has had months to prepare for this storm. Those preparations are now being tested, and in some places, are being ruthlessly exposed. Sophie LongBBC News, Arizona Protesters marched against coronavirus restrictions in Phoenix on 4 July At a small vigil outside the state
capital in Phoenix, Kristin Urquiza arranges flowers around a picture of her
father Mark. He died last week after contracting coronavirus. Like so many
others, he died alone without his wife or daughter by his side. Kristin tells
me her grief is mixed with rage. She blames the Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey
for her dadâs death. Not only did he lift the lockdown too quickly, she says, but he
made people feel it was safe to go out. Others think individuals should
take responsibility. When the bars and clubs reopened here people partied
pre-pandemic style. Jimmy Flores was one of them - he says he thought he was an
invincible fit and healthy 30-year-old. That was before he spent eight days in
hospital on oxygen after contracting coronavirus at a party. During a brief break from an
overflowing ER, Dr Murtaza Akkter tells me how frustrating it was to watch
young people laughing, drinking and hugging outside bars as he drove home after
a busy shift. The bars and clubs are now closed again. The cases of coronavirus
are still climbing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged countries not to turn to fossil fuels while rebuilding their economies after the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking at a virtual summit for clean energy today, Guterres said some countries were using their economic recovery packages to support fossil fuel companies that were already struggling financially. Others are jump-starting coal-fired power plants, including developing countries who argue that coal is necessary for growth. ""Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans,"" Guterres said. The EU and South Korea have already pledged to make their recovery programmes environmentally-friendly.

Gyms, pools, nail bars and outdoor performances are set to return in England, after the government announced another easing of lockdown. Let's take a look at what is reopening and when: A man has pleaded guilty to selling fake coronavirus cure kits to people in France and the United States. Frank Ludlow, 59, was caught by City of London Police. He had been trying to send dozens of parcels of fake remedies in a post office near his West Sussex home. Judge William Mousley said father-of-two Ludlow contacted national governments and ""took advantage of an international crisis"". Read more here. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Slovakia's prime minister Igor Matovic has said his
country might have to reintroduce restrictions, after the country recorded the
single biggest daily increase in Covid-19 infections since 22 April. Matovic said epidemiologists would meet on Monday to discuss the matter. The number of new infections recorded on Wednesday was
53, bringing the total to 1,851. Some 1,477 people have recovered from the
virus, and 28 have died. Slovakia has so far been credited with some of the lowest
infection rates in Europe, as well as what were some of the strictest measures. BBC Radio 5 Live Helen Wong, owner of the
Sweet Mandarin restaurant in Manchester,  tells BBC Radio 5 Live that Rishi Sunak's support is ""highly welcome"". On the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, she says: ""Itâs going to change the
mindset. ""Itâs going to incentivise people to come out and break that
psychological fear of actually meeting people.â Helen has brought in booths and reduced the number of tables in her restaurant from 30 to 10 but says there are still other issues. ""Weâre literally masked up, visored up, we donât want to look
like a hospital but still we need to keep the team safe,"" she says. ""Itâs getting that
balance of enjoying your experience out and dining out but also keeping safety
at the forefront.â The secret to success, she adds, is adapting: ""If youâre not going
to adapt, youâre not going to survive, no matter what size you are.â Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The âun-lockdownâ goes on in England. And, yes, it will be
welcome news for those who run, as well as use places like gyms, swimming
pools and beauticians. But, as ever, the new normal means new complications.
Businesses obviously want to get customers through the door but government
guidance talks about limiting the numbers and spacing out equipment. Gym users
will be expected to play their part too, cleaning machines after use. Many, of
course, will be more than happy to do so. And for those who breach the rules, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden suggested officials would uphold the relevant
standards. But in truth can every leisure space in England really be policed? Common sense will prevail say ministers, with the majority ready to do
what is asked. Meanwhile, business owners will be examining the
guidance closely, hoping that the new normal will allow their firms to be
viable. Oxford University says it will run an in-house Covid-19 testing
service for students and staff from September. The university said its testing system - based at sites in the city centre and Headington - would ""protect our
local community"" and ease the burden on local NHS facilities. It also says research and teaching spaces will be ""adapted
to ensure social distancing and appropriate ventilation"" for the start of term. Libraries will operate social distancing, with a seat-finder app
planned to help students. Face coverings will be required during face-to-face teaching and
in indoor shared spaces - and cleaning will be ""significantly
enhanced"", it added. BBC OS The city of Bergamo in
northern Italy was one of the worst-hit areas by Covid-19 in the country. But now, after 137 days,
the intensive care unit in the city's main hospital, Papa Giovanni XXIII, has
no positive Covid-19 cases. Dr Luca Lorini is the
head of the intensive care unit and emergency department at the hospital. He's been speaking toBBC OS on
World Service radio. ""When we started,
in the first week, we didn't expect so many patients. But it was clear at the
end of the first week that a lot of patients in the region were infected with
Covid-19. ""We worked so hard
in March, April and May. We used more than 100% of our capability,
starting early in the morning trying to find materials, beds, ventilators. It
was three months of very hard work. ""But at the end of
April I observed a downward curve, so we have been expecting this."" Dr Lorini says that the
ICU now has just 72 patients, none of them Covid-positive, and looks like it
did before the coronavirus pandemic. ""It's incredible
because you don't have to use so much protection. So you feel free. You can
drink coffee... the atmosphere is much more comfortable."" However, he says they
still need to be alert for a possible second wave. ""We have to prepare
for the future, because we don't know what will happen. No science, no doctor,
nobody knows."" The Minack Theatre in Cornwall was cited as one venue that can reopen If you're just joining us, here's a reminder about open-air gigs, festivals and theatre shows in England. They can resume from this weekend, as long as they have ""a limited and socially distanced audience"", the government says. Outdoor performances can go ahead from Saturday 11 July. A number of small indoor test events will also take place to help plan how and when venues can begin to reopen. Read morehere.

"Two of the UK's biggest High Street retailers, John Lewis and Boots, have announced 5,300 job cuts. Boots has said 4,000 jobs will go, while John Lewis is shutting down eight stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. The moves come amid warnings thatnew economic support from Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill not be enough to stop millions of workers losing their jobs. Mr Sunak admitted thathe would not be able to protect ""every single job""as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". Boots is consulting on plans to cut head office and store teams and shut 48 of its more than 600 Boots Opticians practices. It has not yet said which outlets will close, but about 7% of its workforce will lose their jobs. John Lewis said department stores in Birmingham and Watford will not reopen as the coronavirus lockdown eases. It also plans to shut down its At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth and travel sites at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras. Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' How is furlough changing? Mr Sunak unveiled a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at saving jobs, including a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee retained to the end of January 2021. He also announced measures to benefit the hospitality sector, includinggiving diners 50% off eating out from Monday to Wednesday in August. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves to support restaurants, pubs and cafes could also help retail. ""We very much hope that when people go to their local pub or their restaurant to eat out, those are often in the centre of towns, hopefully that will encourage the footfall to those areas so we get more people going to our shops as well,"" Mr Dowden said, speaking after announcing the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and outdoor theatres. John Lewis says some of its stores were in trouble before the virus struck, while Boots already had plans for a shake-up. The crisis has forced them to speed up efforts to deal with the rise of internet shopping. And just now they face the phasing out of the government-supported furlough scheme, starting next month. One by one, retailers are revealing how many staff they will bring back into stores as the job subsidy is withdrawn. Most Boots outlets remained open throughout the lockdown to provide pharmacy and healthcare services, but the firm said footfall had ""dramatically reduced"". The firm said sales across all Boots UK outlets were down 50% in the third quarter, and some 70% at Boots Opticians. ""Restrictions are beginning to lift, but with an uncertain economic outlook, it is anticipated that the High Street will take considerable time to recover,"" it said. Boots said last year that it was reviewing the size of its UK operationswith the possibility that up to 200 stores could be closed. The managing director of Boots UK, Sebastian James, described the latest cuts as ""decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan"". John Lewis said the eight stores affected were already ""financially challenged"" even before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 had caused customers to move more quickly towards online shopping and away from stores. John Lewis Partnership chairwoman Sharon White said: ""Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today's announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners. ""However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership - and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop."" Ms White said John Lewis would do everything it could to keep on as many people as possible. John Lewis had warned in March it could close shopsas a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. Former John Lewis boss Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands, said the closure of the chain's flagship Birmingham store was ""deeply disappointing"". ""At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one which I believe risks being a dreadful mistake,""he tweeted,external. He added that his belief in its potential was ""unwavering"" and that he would be making the case for it to stay open. The planned closure of John Lewis's Watford store has prompteda petition to save it,external, which has been signed by 4,400 people so far. Other John Lewis customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""With no modification to the jobs retention scheme, that dreaded October cliff-edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. ""Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace."" Vivienne King, chief executive at Revo, which represents the retail property sector, warned that three million retail jobs remained in jeopardy unless the government undertook ""a fundamental review of business rates and direct financial support to underwrite rents"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak himself told BBC Breakfast: ""Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs? Yes, and the scale of this is significant. ""We are entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen. That is of course going to have a significant impact on unemployment and on job losses."" Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said the job cuts were ""deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots"" and described Mr Sunak's statement as ""a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it"".

"Armed police arrived on the scene within two minutes The man who was the first stabbing victim of the Glasgow hotel knife attacker has told the BBC he thought he was going to die. Max Aubin was among six people stabbed by asylum seeker Badreddin Abadlla Adam at the city's Park Inn in West George Street on 26 June. He said he had seen Adam before but had never spoken to him until he called him over and then knifed him twice. But although he came close to death, Mr Aubin says he has already forgiven him. Speaking to the BBC, the 20-year-old, who would like to become a criminal lawyer, said that Friday started like any other day. He said: ""I was in my room when my friend Dante messaged me saying he needs tobacco. I said I would meet him outside. Badreddin Abadlla Adam carried out multiple stabbings in Glasgow ""I was late to meet him so he had started to returned to his hotel. I saw him and shouted him to come back. ""Then I heard the guy (Adam) say 'hey you' and I was surprised because it was the first time he had talked to me. He didn't talk to anyone. He said 'Can I see you?'"". Concerns over asylum hotel plan ahead of incident Glasgow stabbings: What we know Suspect family 'shocked and saddened' Mr Aubin said he thought he might need his help. He put his hand out to shake Adam's hand but he blocked it and he slapped him on the head. He said: ""It was real quick, he slapped me, I started to panic and he started to stab me - two seconds, so quick. ""I felt something on my body but I didn't see the knife. I went to go to the ground but he grabbed my t-shirt and tried to stab me again. When I went to run, my t-shirt ripped and I looked to find Dante. ""He stabbed me on both sides. I didn't feel pain but when I saw the blood I realised he had stabbed me."" The incident sparked a major police operation in the city centre After Mr Aubin was attacked, he said he heard someone screaming, in a stairwell, but he did not see it. He remembers looking down and seeing that he was bleeding. ""When I saw my blood I thought I would die. ""My eyes wanted to close. But in my mind I thought, if I close my eyes I will die, so I fought to stay awake."" Both men were among 100 asylum seekers moved to the hotel during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Aubin, from the Ivory Coast, had been in Scotland for just 20 days when he found himself at the centre of one of the city's biggest police operations, sparked by reports of ""armed attacks"" at the city centre hotel. The 28-year-old Sudanese attacker was shot dead by police, but not before he stabbedPC David Whyteand five other casualties, including two members of hotel staff and three asylum seekers. PC David Whyte was treated in hospital for serious injuries Mr Aubin says he was well looked after in hospital and although he still feels pain, he says it is improving every day. But he keeps reliving the attack in his mind. He said: ""When I remember, I take my bible and I start to pray. I am a Christian."" Mr Aubin said he feels very lucky to be alive and he does not blame Adam for what happened to him. ""I thank the Lord every morning that I am alive. It was just a bad day. ""He is dead but I prayed for him. It wasn't him, I think maybe he was sick. ""We have to forgive him. I am alive and once the doctor said I would be okay, I prayed for him. ""I forgave him already. I was just worried for the police officer."" Despite going through such a traumatic event, Mr Aubin still believes Glasgow is a ""nice city"". He said: ""It is not the city, it was the one man.

NO Premier League games tomorrow, if you can believe such a thing. But five games on Saturday, spread over four kick-offs from lunchtime until bedtime. As busy as you like. Saturday looks like: Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Robbie SavageEx-Wales midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Jack Grealish is good enough for a top-six side but if you look at the way Manchester United play now - that one-touch passing, the movement, the pace - the big question about Jack is: does he hold on to the ball too long to draw fouls? When you play with better players. you probably move the ball quicker because at Aston Villa, he probably feels like everything here centres around 'Jack Grealish.' He loves the club, he's a supporter, everything is on his shoulders being captain trying to get the club to safety. So, if he moved to a bigger club with better players, he would probably feel the responsibility wouldn't be as great. Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Aston Villa Aston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to Sky Sports:""It unravelled with the first goal. We made a bright start, had some chances, they are always a threat on the counter but it all changed round on the penalty decision. ""I can understand Jon (Moss, referee) getting it wrong but I don't know what VAR are looking at - it's a disgraceful decision. They have a screen they can go and look at it but they don't seem to be bothered."" ""Fernandes is trying a double drag back - his first touch is on the ball his second touch is on Ezri Konsa's shin. I won't tell you what I think... ""Unfortunately they were too good for us in the second half with that lead. The second goal was the one, the reaction after the first goal wasn't great, the second goal was the one. If you go in at 1-0 you can gather the troops and go again. ""That's the first time we've had a going over since Project Restart. We are running out of games, the games will be tough but if we get back to the way we have been playing we'll win games."" Aston Villa manager Dean Smith has called the decision to give Manchester United the penalty for the opening goal 'disgraceful.' Full reaction to come. Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Manchester United Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, speaking to Sky Sports:""We are really pleased with ourselves because we know we have to carry on.

"Swimmers may have to arrive in their costumes and the number of people in lanes be limited when pools reopen, to allow for social distancing. For the time being indoor and outdoor pools must remain shut, despite theeasing of some lockdown restrictions,external, It's thought chlorine in swimming pools will kill coronavirus but Swim England has warned a ""stricter regime"" will still be needed when they do reopen. The body has warned 500 pools in England could close permanently. Pools in England cannot reopen before 4 July under the government's current plan for lifting lockdown restrictions and the advice also says people should not swim at the beach without a lifeguard present. In Scotland, indoor leisure facilities will not be able to openuntil the country moves to phase three of its plan for easing the lockdownand they will be subject to physical distancing and hygiene measures. A provisional date for reopening pools is also yet to be given in Wales and Northern Ireland, where indoor leisure centres will remain closed until step fourof its lockdown plan. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? But as the weather has warmed up, people have headed to beaches, with three people seriously injured whilejumping off a cliff into the sea at Durdle Door in Dorset on Saturday. In London, the Serpentine Lido in Hyde Park was forced to close after attempting to reopen last week because it became too crowded. Chlorinated water should kill the virus, but preventing it from spreading in changing rooms and other areas around pools remains a concern. Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said guidance was still being finalised but that people might be asked not to use changing rooms, and pools could be told to limit how many people could be in the water at a time. She toldThe Times,externalpeople might have to arrive ""beach ready"" in their costumes. Olympic gold-medallist Duncan Goodhew, who is president of the Swimathon charity, told Radio 4's Today programme there were 5,000 public pools in England, 10% of which might not be able to reopen with social-distancing measures as they were ""old, inefficient and expensive to run"". He said: ""A little like a restaurant, it becomes very difficult economically to make it work because you're just not getting the volume of people through."" Swim England has called for financial support from the government to help ensure pools are financially viable as the lockdown eases. Ms Nickerson said: ""We know there will be major financial challenges for pool operators, all of whom saw their income disappear overnight, and who will be faced with the dilemma of opening pools against the backdrop of less footfall and increased environmental costs."" Mr Goodhew, who won gold at 100m breaststroke in Moscow in 1980, added: ""It's really important the pools open because there are many, many people out there, some people who are disabled or have bad hips, etc, who cannot do any other exercise. ""From a point of view of quality of life, we've got to get them open."" Thea Paraskevaides, 33, is one of those who is desperate to get back in the pool. She started swimming 18 months ago after a bad ankle injury and relies on the activity as her main form of exercise. ""Aside from the fitness element, it's really important for mental health,"" she said. ""For me I feel like I need that exercise to help my wellbeing, especially now at such a difficult time."" While she feels confident she would be able to maintain social distancing while swimming, Thea said she would still have some concerns about hygiene around the pool. ""I would have to take hand sanitiser and wipes and clean everything before I touched it,"" she added. Louise Zecevic, who used to swim regularly with her children before the lockdown, said she would be happy to put up with any restrictions needed when pools are allowed to reopen. ""If numbers were restricted I would accept that and it might make the swimming experience more pleasant in some ways as the pools near me in London can be massively overcrowded,"" the 39-year-old said. ""We all love swimming and my kids are constantly asking when we can go back to the pool. ""We've had a paddling pool in the back garden but it's not an activity you can really replicate."" Louise and her family have been missing swimming during the lockdown Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said chlorine was ""very easily able to inactivate most viruses including Covid-19"", but ""the main problem will be the social distancing, mostly the changing rooms"". Swim England is working with Public Health England on advice for pools reopening, which will be published on 15 June. Among the issues which will be covered are water treatment, air circulation and social distancing. The Swimming Teachers' Association is also liaising with the government on measures for after the lockdown. Chief executive Dave Candler said there was no ""one-size fits all"" answer to personal hygiene and social distancing measures for the industry - which would ""most likely mean smaller classes in the interim"".

Saturday looks like: Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Robbie SavageEx-Wales midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Jack Grealish is good enough for a top-six side but if you look at the way Manchester United play now - that one-touch passing, the movement, the pace - the big question about Jack is: does he hold on to the ball too long to draw fouls? When you play with better players. you probably move the ball quicker because at Aston Villa, he probably feels like everything here centres around 'Jack Grealish.' He loves the club, he's a supporter, everything is on his shoulders being captain trying to get the club to safety. So, if he moved to a bigger club with better players, he would probably feel the responsibility wouldn't be as great. Aston Villa 0-3 Manchester United Aston Villa Aston Villa boss Dean Smith, speaking to Sky Sports:""It unravelled with the first goal. We made a bright start, had some chances, they are always a threat on the counter but it all changed round on the penalty decision. ""I can understand Jon (Moss, referee) getting it wrong but I don't know what VAR are looking at - it's a disgraceful decision. They have a screen they can go and look at it but they don't seem to be bothered."" ""Fernandes is trying a double drag back - his first touch is on the ball his second touch is on Ezri Konsa's shin. I won't tell you what I think... ""Unfortunately they were too good for us in the second half with that lead. The second goal was the one, the reaction after the first goal wasn't great, the second goal was the one. If you go in at 1-0 you can gather the troops and go again.

"The coronavirus took hold slowly in India, but six months after its first confirmed infection it has overtaken Russia to record the world's third largest caseload. With the world's second-largest population, much of which lives packed into cities, the country was perhaps always destined to become a global hotspot. But the data behind its case numbers is questionable, because India is not testing enough, and an unusually low death rate has baffled scientists. Here's five things we know about the spread of coronavirus in India. India has seen a series of record spikes recently, adding tens of thousands of cases daily. It recorded most of its confirmed cases in June, within weeks of reopening after a rigid lockdown. As of 8 July, India had 742,417 confirmed cases. But the true scale of infection rates in the population is unclear, according to virologist Shahid Jameel. The government conducted a random sample of 26,000 Indians in May, which showed that 0.73% had the virus. Some experts have reservations about the sample size, but others, such as Dr Jameel, say it's the only country-wide indicator they have to work with. ""If we extrapolate that to the whole population, we would have had 10 million infections in mid-May,"" Dr Jameel said. Given that confirmed cases in India have been doubling every 20 days, that would put the current total between 30 and 40 million. The gap between confirmed cases and actual infections exists in every country, but to different degrees. Testing is the only way to bridge it. ""If you test more, you will find more,"" Dr Jameel said. That's what has happened in India in recent weeks - as the government ramped up testing, case numbers suddenly increased. India has done more than 10 million tests since 13 March, but more than half of those happened after 1 June. India's official caseload is high in absolute numbers, but it's relatively low in per capita terms. The world, on average, has three times as many cases as India per capita - a fact pointed out by the government recently. But, according to Dr Jameel, India's per capita caseload is low simply because it tests so little. Compare India to countries that have a high per capita caseload and you will find those countries are testing far more. India's caseload is nearly invisible on this scale because its testing rate is so low. But it's not just about how much you test, it's also about who you test. India's emphasis on test and trace early on limited the pool of people it was testing to high-risk cases and their contacts - and kept it from expanding to the wider population. Test and trace is insufficient once the infection starts to spread rapidly, said Himanshu Tyagi and Aditya Gopalan, mathematicians who have studied Covid-19 testing strategies. It helps with containment, but it does not discover new cases that have emerged undetected in the community, Mr Tyagi and Mr Gopalan said. India has to test a broad swathe of people for that to happen. But how do we know who India is testing? Comparing testing numbers across countries is tricky because some count how many people they test, while others count how many tests they do. India does the latter and this number is slightly exaggerated because most people get tested more than once. So instead, scientists prefer to calculate how many tests it takes to find a single confirmed case. The more tests it takes, the wider you are casting your net. Here, India fares poorly compared to countries that have managed to control the spread of the virus. And the more widely you test, the lower your positive rate - that's why New Zealand and Taiwan have rates well below 1%. India's positive rate is now up from 3.8% in April to 6.4% in July. If it keeps rising, it's because testing is still limited to a narrow pool of high-risk people and their contacts. The data suggests that those in India who have been diagnosed with the virus are recovering from it faster than they are dying from it. This is crucial, Dr Jameel said, because it determines the strain on the health system. Currently, deaths are rising more slowly than confirmed cases or recoveries - but if that rate quickens, it would increase the pressure on hospitals, possibly driving up deaths. The caveat is that low testing rates means fewer new cases are recorded, and at a slower pace. That will quicken the recovery rate in comparison to that of confirmed cases. Globally, India's recovery curve appears steeper than other badly hit countries - in this instance, a steeper curve is a good thing. It means Covid-19 patients in India are recovering faster than those in the US or Brazil. India's share of recoveries - that is, the % of total confirmed cases in a given country that have made a full recovery - is also higher. At nearly 60%, it's far ahead of the US, where it is 27%. When it comes to recovery though, data is patchy and the definition varies. India defines as recovered anyone who tests positive for the virus and then, weeks later, tests negative. Some countries only count hospitalised cases that make a full recovery. What's important is that, irrespective of how many people are recovering within each of these countries, India's share of recoveries is higher. And that's because India's reported deaths are lower. India has so far recorded about 20,160 deaths from Covid-19. In absolute numbers, that is the eighth highest tally in the world. But per million of the population, it is low. ""It's a fraction of what you are seeing in Western Europe,"" said Shamika Ravi, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. There have been a lot of questions around India's Covid-19 death figures, and most experts agree that they are likely being underreported. But Dr Ravi said that did not explain the significant gap in death rates between India and Europe. ""If we were indeed having high death rates, no amount of data could have hidden that - that's 20-40 times as many deaths,"" she said. India's low death rate is also similar to other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia. Theories range from a higher prevalence of infections in the region to a less virulent strain of the virus circulating in these countries to younger populations on average than badly hit Western nations, given that Covid-19 predominantly kills the elderly. ""Every country cannot be fudging its data,"" Dr Jameel said. ""Maybe innate immunity in these populations is higher due to a high load of other infections. But we really do not know yet why their deaths rates are so low. Much like the US or the European Union, coronavirus statistics vary widely across India's states. Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country's caseload. And as case numbers have waned in some areas, they have surged in others. The latest surge is in Karnataka and Telangana, in the south. Another southern state, Andhra Pradesh, is also seeing consistent and intense spikes. India's response to the virus has so far been centralised, and that is part of what needs to change, experts said. India would have to be ""broken down into districts"" to implement a successful strategy against coronavirus, Dr Jameel said, ""because another national lockdown could be even less effective than the last one."" And rather than state-level snapshots, the authorities would need granular, localised data, according to Dr Ravi. ""Every block, we must know if you have symptoms,"" she said.

"Leisure facilities and beauty services in England will be allowed to reopen, the government has announced. Pools, gyms, nail bars and tattooists will be able to open their doors again, and team sports - starting with cricket - will be allowed to resume. Announcing the changes at a briefing at No 10, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged people to ""work out to help out"". Outdoor performances will also be able to resume with limited audiences. It came as the UK reported the deaths of a further 85 people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 44,602. Mr Dowden said ""all the data"" was continuing to ""move in the right direction"" despite the reopening of pubs and restaurants last weekend. Outdoor concerts, plays and opera get government go-ahead Why haven't nail bars, gyms and pools been open? 'It's a great feeling to have gyms back again' He said normal life was ""slowly returning"" and that this was an important milestone for the country's performers and artists, who had been ""waiting in the wings since March"". ""I'm really urging people to get out there and to play their part,"" he said. ""Buy the tickets for outdoor plays and musical recitals, get to your local gallery and support your local businesses."" But the culture secretary warned the measures were conditional and reversible, adding that the government would impose local lockdowns if cases started to spike. This video can not be played Dowden: 'We need to get the nation match fit to defeat this disease' What will reopen when? Outdoor pools and outdoor theatres will be able to reopen from Saturday 11 July Grassroots sport will be able to return from this coming weekend, beginning with cricket Beauticians, tattooists, spas, tanning salons and other close-contact services can reopen""subject to some restrictions on particularly high-risk services""from 13 July Indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities can reopen from 25 July Singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments will be allowed in professional environments and Mr Dowden said specific scientific studies on the risks had been commissioned Small pilots of indoor performances, with socially distanced audiences, will also take place to help work out the best way for them to restart Not all forms of beauty treatment will be able to go ahead, assome are deemed too high-risk. These include face waxing, sugaring or threading services, facial treatments, make-up application and eyebrow treatments. Vanita Parti, chief executive of walk-in beauty chain Blink Brow Bar, said that at first she had welcomed the news but then she received an email from the British Beauty Council telling herno treatments to the face would be allowed. ""I'm furious. We can't reopen,"" she said. ""This will kill so many businesses."" Guidance for the reopening of sports facilities,externalhas been published, including on cleaning regimes, social distancing and protection for staff. Measures include limiting the number of people using a facility at one time, reducing class sizes and spacing out equipment. Face coverings will not be mandatory in gyms. Small numbers of supporters will be able to watch outdoor sports, provided social distancing measures and group size rules are followed. Each sport will have to submit an action plan to the government of how it will operate safely, with sports where a single ball is used having to show how they can reduce the risk of it transmitting the virus. The government said a team led by England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam had been visiting sports sites to see the sector's preparations to reopen safely. When put to him that the restrictions would make exercise ""less fun"", Mr Dowden said people would get used to the new measures. He said: ""The judgment we've taken with this [pubs] and swimming pools and elsewhere is it is better to reopen with those restrictions than not reopen at all.""

"Taxpayers face a day of reckoning when the government's massive coronavirus support measures have to be paid off, experts warn. The Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank says the economy will remain in a ""support and recovery"" phase for some time, but higher taxes are inevitable. On Wednesday, the chancellor unveiled another Â£30bn of support, bringing the total cost to Â£190bn. But it was revealed the UK's tax authority queried its value for money. The most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about the value of two measures in his summer statement - the Job Retention Bonus and the eating out support. Wednesday's additional spending announced by Mr Sunak is worth nearly Â£3,000 for every person in the UK - and more than the entire planned health budget for 2020-21. It also means that the cost of the crisis so far has risen by more than 40% since last month, when the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,estimated it at Â£133bn,external. Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Rishi Sunak: We can't protect every job Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? On Thursday, in its analysis of the latest measures, the IFS predicted that government borrowing would surge to about Â£350bn this year. In March, the government forecast a deficit of about Â£50bn to Â£60bn this year. The IFS said it expected further spending support in the autumn Budget, perhaps through targeted tax cuts. However, IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Let's hold in the back of our minds that a reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually. ""This is no normal recession. It's the deepest in history,"" Mr Johnson said. The IFS said annual borrowing as a share of the economy was on course to be its highest outside wartime in more than 300 years. Mr Sunak has given few details about how he intends to pay for the huge public spending, but has previously refused to rule out tax rises. There are some things no chancellor can prepare for - such as what to do if your economy wipes out 18 years' gains in two months of lockdown. His solution was to temporarily deep freeze the economy, and pump money into crisis response. And the thawing process needs more funds, to prevent long term damage. Now economists are talking about a deficit, a shortfall of way more than the Â£300bn previously expected. It's equivalent to a bigger slice of the economy than at any time since the Second World War. And it could get bigger; if more is needed to support the recovery - or in the event of a severe second wave. But it's a cost worth bearing if it carries the economy through a devastating crisis, safeguard the damage to output and jobs -  and ensure taxes get paid. For at some point, there will have to be a discussion about how we pay this back. The government is currently borrowing record amounts on the financial markets to plug the gap - but that may not be enough. There may have to be tax hikes, possibly less generous rises in pensions. But it may be a while until the economy is robust enough to bear that. Of the policy measures announced in Wednesday's summer statement, the biggest was the plan to pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. The total bill could rise as high as Â£9.4bn, but only if every furloughed worker keeps their job. But Mr Johnson said there was a ""value for money issue"" about the scheme. ""A lot, probably a majority, of the job retention bonus money will go in respect of jobs that would have been, indeed already have been, returned from furlough anyway,"" he said. And he said much of the planned cuts in VAT and stamp duty ""will be deadweight"". It has also emerged that the UK tax authority had some doubts. Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, wrote to the chancellor earlier this week about the Job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out policies. On both, he said, advice received by HMRC and the Treasury ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the proposals. However, the correspondence showed the chancellor said the plans should go ahead because there was a ""compelling case"". Businessman Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, also questioned if the job retention bonus was money well spent, as he thought some firms would only retain staff until they get the cash. ""Firms will either want their staff back, or they won't. I just feel some employers will take advantage of this scheme,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Meanwhile, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the financial cost of the crisis, at Â£190bn so far, was ""approaching the amount we spend on the day-to-day running of our NHS, schools and colleges each year"". He welcomed the focus on supporting young people and sectors most affected by lockdown, but added: ""The scale of support... risks falling short of what will be required. The chancellor is taking quite a gamble on the strength of the recovery in the months ahead."" JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"Two of the UK's biggest High Street retailers, John Lewis and Boots, have announced 5,300 job cuts. Boots has said 4,000 jobs will go, while John Lewis is shutting down eight stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. The moves come amid warnings thatnew economic support from Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill not be enough to stop millions of workers losing their jobs. Mr Sunak admitted thathe would not be able to protect ""every single job""as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". Boots is consulting on plans to cut head office and store teams and shut 48 of its more than 600 Boots Opticians practices. It has not yet said which outlets will close, but about 7% of its workforce will lose their jobs. John Lewis said department stores in Birmingham and Watford will not reopen as the coronavirus lockdown eases. It also plans to shut down its At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth and travel sites at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras. Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' How is furlough changing? Mr Sunak unveiled a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at saving jobs, including a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee retained to the end of January 2021. He also announced measures to benefit the hospitality sector, includinggiving diners 50% off eating out from Monday to Wednesday in August. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves to support restaurants, pubs and cafes could also help retail. ""We very much hope that when people go to their local pub or their restaurant to eat out, those are often in the centre of towns, hopefully that will encourage the footfall to those areas so we get more people going to our shops as well,"" Mr Dowden said, speaking after announcing the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and outdoor theatres. John Lewis says some of its stores were in trouble before the virus struck, while Boots already had plans for a shake-up. The crisis has forced them to speed up efforts to deal with the rise of internet shopping. And just now they face the phasing out of the government-supported furlough scheme, starting next month. One by one, retailers are revealing how many staff they will bring back into stores as the job subsidy is withdrawn. Most Boots outlets remained open throughout the lockdown to provide pharmacy and healthcare services, but the firm said footfall had ""dramatically reduced"". The firm said sales across all Boots UK outlets were down 50% in the third quarter, and some 70% at Boots Opticians. ""Restrictions are beginning to lift, but with an uncertain economic outlook, it is anticipated that the High Street will take considerable time to recover,"" it said. Boots said last year that it was reviewing the size of its UK operationswith the possibility that up to 200 stores could be closed. The managing director of Boots UK, Sebastian James, described the latest cuts as ""decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan"". John Lewis said the eight stores affected were already ""financially challenged"" even before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 had caused customers to move more quickly towards online shopping and away from stores. John Lewis Partnership chairwoman Sharon White said: ""Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today's announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners. ""However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership - and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop."" Ms White said John Lewis would do everything it could to keep on as many people as possible. John Lewis had warned in March it could close shopsas a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. Former John Lewis boss Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands, said the closure of the chain's flagship Birmingham store was ""deeply disappointing"". ""At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one which I believe risks being a dreadful mistake,""he tweeted,external. He added that his belief in its potential was ""unwavering"" and that he would be making the case for it to stay open. The planned closure of John Lewis's Watford store has prompteda petition to save it,external, which has been signed by 4,400 people so far. Other John Lewis customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""With no modification to the jobs retention scheme, that dreaded October cliff-edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. ""Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace."" Vivienne King, chief executive at Revo, which represents the retail property sector, warned that three million retail jobs remained in jeopardy unless the government undertook ""a fundamental review of business rates and direct financial support to underwrite rents"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak himself told BBC Breakfast: ""Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs? Yes, and the scale of this is significant. ""We are entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen. That is of course going to have a significant impact on unemployment and on job losses."" Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said the job cuts were ""deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots"" and described Mr Sunak's statement as ""a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it"".

"The main five-star Celtic Manor Resort has 400 bedrooms Almost half of the nearly 1,000 jobs at one of Wales' best-known hotels are to be lost due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the tourism sector. Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which stagedgolf's Ryder Cup in 2010,externaland the2014 Nato Conference, told staff that 450 of its 995 posts are to be made redundant. The company, owned by Wales' first billionaire Sir Terry Matthews, is one of Newport's major employers. Affected staff have been sent a letter. The Welsh Government said the first minister would announce changes on Friday, to be phased in over three weeks, that will see parts of Wales' visitor, hospitality, leisure and tourism industries reopen. The five-star hotel has been shut since the coronavirus lockdown began on 23 March and when it reopens on 14 July, it will only do so ""under reduced capacities and restricted facilities in line with safety guidelines to mitigate the risk of coronavirus"". Tourism economy in Wales on 'brink of collapse' Lockdown review gives tourism sector 'hope' Tourism hopes as five-mile travel limit ends ""It is clear the Covid-19 crisis will continue to have a catastrophic effect on the global economy, our nation and the travel, tourism and events industries for many months to come,"" said a company statement. Former US President Barack Obama shakes hands with Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones at the 2014 Nato Conference at Celtic Manor ""The Celtic Collection must reshape and resize its business to ensure that it is fit for the future. ""With drastically reduced occupancies and revenues, its current financial model is not sustainable,"" it said. The Celtic Collection has 650 bedrooms across four hotel sites - including the main 400-bedroom resort - whileanother 154-room budget hotel is currently being built,externalin nearby Langstone next to the Coldra junction of the M4. The Â£83m International Convention Centre Wales opened last year - a joint venture with the Welsh Government - on a 2,000-acre site overlooking the M4 motorway on the east of Newport. The 5,000-capacity venue, built with a Â£22.5m Welsh Government grant, boasted an evening with Hollywood movie superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of its first events after opening in September 2019. The 2,000-acre Celtic Manor site includes a new golf course built especially to host the 2010 Ryder Cup The portfolio also includes three golf courses, numerous restaurants, two spas, a country inn, a children's nursery and an adventure playground. Sir Terry, Wales' fourth richest man with an estimated wealth of Â£1.24bn, bought the Manor House and former hospital site in 1980. Sir Terry Matthews has founded or funded about 100 companies in high-tech communications The 77-year-old electronics entrepreneur, who was born at the old Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital in June 1943, transformed the area into one of the UK's best-known hotel and golf complexes. He built three championship golf courses - including the new Twenty Ten course for the 2010 Ryder Cup, a biannual showpiece event where the best golfers from Europe play the best from the United States. Entertainers like TV presenters Ant and Dec, Hollywood actor Michael Douglas, American singer Meat Loaf and comedian Rob Brydon have starred in the hotel's annual Celebrity Cup golf tournament. Q&A: Your travel questions answered Celtic Manor Santa's grotto criticised But the impact of the coronavirus crisis has meant the Celtic Manor group has had to make the ""extremely difficult decision"" to start consulting staff for redundancy. ""This figure is based on the current restrictions surrounding hospitality and tourism,"" added the Celtic Manor statement. Europe beat the United States in the first four-day rain-affected Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor ""The total may reduce significantly should more of our facilities be permitted to reopen during the consultation period."" The company says it ""deeply regrets having to take this course of action in response to the devastating economic consequences"" of the coronavirus pandemic. The Celtic Manor added it ""understands the enormous impact this will have on the livelihoods of affected team members and their families"". ""Everything possible will be done to support those affected and an employees' consultative panel has been involved in the decision-making process,"" added the statement. Lorraine Gaskell, of the GMB, called on Sir Terry to help. ""This is terrible news for Newport,"" she said. ""This workforce has helped to make Terry Matthews the first billionaire in Wales, so we think it's only right that in these unprecedented times, he puts his hand into his very well lined pocket and keeps the staff on furlough."" She dubbed the decision ""short sighted and cruel"". ""When this pandemic passes, he will need their skills, hard work and dedication to keep the Celtic Manor Resort as one of Wales' premier venues."" The Welsh Government said it was ""doing everything we can to help"" and had instigated the ""most generous"" business support package in the UK. ""Although the UK government's decision to reduce the VAT rate on the hospitality sector is welcomed we will continue to ask for sectoral employment protection schemes for sectors such as tourism, hospitality and events which continue to be closed or very substantially impacted by Covid-19 measures,"" a spokesman said.

"The chancellor's incentive scheme to persuade employers to keep on furloughed staff beyond October may not be enough to stem job losses. The furlough scheme will be replaced with a one-off Â£1,000 reward for each worker retained for three months, Rishi Sunak said in his summer statement. But employers' groups are warning more support may be needed to protect jobs. Trade Union leader Frances O'Grady described the scheme as a ""little tinkering around the edges"". The chancellor was widely praised for taking decisive action in March when he introduced the furlough scheme to protect jobs, which has supported nine million employees over the last three months. But there were concerns that firms would lay off workers as soon as government financial support was withdrawn, creating a ""cliff edge"" for jobs. In announcing the new Â£1,000 Job Retention Bonus, the chancellor said creating and protecting jobs was the ""most urgent challenge"" the government faced but said keeping workers on furlough would provide some employees with ""false hope"". Employers can receive a one-off payment of Â£1,000 for each furloughed employee who remains employed until the end of January 2021 The employee must earn above Â£520 per month on average over that period Payments will be made from February 2021 Further details will be announced by the end of July However, several organisations have expressed doubts that the scheme will be sufficient to protect the millions of jobs that hang in the balance. ""The chancellor is absolutely right to prioritise jobs,"" said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. She also welcomed the additional measures to create new jobs for young people, traineeships and apprenticeships. ""But prevention is better than cure. Many viable firms are facing maximum jeopardy right now,"" she added. ""With nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed."" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman, also welcomed the ""jobs first approach"" but questioned whether the retention scheme would work smoothly enough. ""The job retention bonus must be easy to access. We can't have paperwork holding up this vital support. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said the retention scheme might not provide a sufficient bridge for many firms coming off the furlough scheme. ""A little tweaking around the edges is not going to provide the plan we need for those industries that are critical for this country's future,"" she said. The government is offering a carrot if they hang on to workers. The government says it could cost up to Â£9bn - a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed workers multiplied by Â£1,000. Of course it won't be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and then over 20% in October - followed by three months of full wages to land a prize of Â£1,000 during the worst downturn in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in  the worst affected industries by cutting VAT and offering half price early bird food but it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that long. We also learned two other important things today. First that any idea of extending the furlough scheme - as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and business are realising just how much they need each other. So he is dangling his Â£1,000 carrot. The question is: is it big enough to save those jobs. Employers were aware that the furlough scheme was being wound down. Firms were told they would have to pay employees pension and National Insurance contributions in August and contribute some money towards staff pay in September and October as part of a flexible furlough scheme. Critics say at this stage many firms will already have decided to cut jobs rather than take on that extra burden. The think tank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the Â£1,000 was unlikely to be enough to persuade firms to keep on staff given the difficult economic environment. ""While the aim of the Summer Statement is laudable, the new measures look to be badly timed and could precipitate a rapid increase in unemployment,"" said Garry Young, NIESR Deputy Director. ""The incentives offered to employers look too small to be effective.  Many employers have been topping up the pay of furloughed workers and are expected to bear more of the cost of the scheme from next month.  They will be reluctant to do this now they know that the scheme won't be extended."" What happens when furlough ends?

"UK airlines have said they are being ""ignored"" by the government after not being included in a fresh wave of economic stimulus to counter the effects of coronavirus. Industry body Airlines UK warned of further job losses after tens of thousands of job cuts. Gyms also said they were ignored, and retailers called for tax breaks. The government had earlier said it had put in place ""one of most comprehensive economic responses in the world"". The UK aviation sector has repeatedly called for more aid from the government as it grapples with the plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The industry has announced many thousands of job losses over the past months. Traffic in April and May fell more than 90% as airlines were hit by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. Demand is not expected to pick back up to its previous level for three years, but airlines still face costs, such as leasing aircraft, that they have to pay. The fresh set of measures Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday to help the UK economy included dinersgetting 50% off their restaurant billsduring Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August to stimulate the hospitality sector, anda reduction in stamp dutyto aid the housing sector. However, Airlines UK reacted angrily to the plans, saying its members had been left out. ""Tens of thousands of jobs lost in aviation and a winter season where we're likely to see connectivity slashed,"" a spokesman said. ""Now the Prime Minister has said the furlough scheme will end in October. Something needs to give and if the government continues to ignore aviation we're going to see our regional airports with fewer connections and more jobs lost across aviation and aerospace."" The expectation that the government's furlough scheme will end in Octoberin part helped to drive the timing of thousands of job cutslast week, many of which fell in the retail sector. The retail industry said it had hoped for aid like the tax break Mr Sunak announced on Wednesday for the hospitality sector. The government lowered VAT on hospitality and tourism to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. ""It was disappointing that the Chancellor did not extend this measure to the retail industry and the three million people it employs,"" the British Retail Consortium said. ""It was a missed opportunity and we hope that the government will reconsider this ahead of the autumn Budget."" However, the BRC said it welcomed the Chancellor's ""huge support"" for employment and training, which included a Job Retention Bonus ofÂ£1,000 per furloughed employee still employed at the end of January. Although businesses such as pubs have been allowed to reopen, other firms such as gyms have not. Pure Gym employs just over 1,500 workers across 265 sites, as well as providing work for 3,500 self-employed personal trainers. Humphrey Cobbold, the chief executive of PureGym, said that the gym and fitness sector ""has been forgotten and ignored."" ""It is all very well opening pubs and restaurants - and now subsidising their trade with massive VAT discounts and unlimited meal vouchers - but to be honest it beggars belief that thousands of hard working gym and fitness operators are being left high and dry with no specific support."" ""And let's remember, unlike pubs and restaurants, many of whom have been able to earn revenue from off sales and takeaways, gym and fitness operators have had zero revenue for 110 days."" Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunakresponded to a question in the House of Commons,externalsaying he hoped the government could make progress on reopening gyms, and that airlines and aviation ""are experiencing a difficult period."" ""I remain in close contact with the industry and with individual companies to understand what is happening, and if there are things that we can and should do, of course we will,"" he said. Later, ina speech laying out the latest government stimulus plans,external, he said: ""While we can't protect every job, one of the most important things we can do to prevent unemployment, is to get as many people as possible from furlough back to their jobs."" He then laid out details of the jobs retention bonus, saying: ""Our message to business is clear: if you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.""

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

"Two of the UK's biggest High Street retailers, John Lewis and Boots, have announced 5,300 job cuts. Boots has said 4,000 jobs will go, while John Lewis is shutting down eight stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. The moves come amid warnings thatnew economic support from Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill not be enough to stop millions of workers losing their jobs. Mr Sunak admitted thathe would not be able to protect ""every single job""as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". Boots is consulting on plans to cut head office and store teams and shut 48 of its more than 600 Boots Opticians practices. It has not yet said which outlets will close, but about 7% of its workforce will lose their jobs. John Lewis said department stores in Birmingham and Watford will not reopen as the coronavirus lockdown eases. It also plans to shut down its At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth and travel sites at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras. Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' How is furlough changing? Mr Sunak unveiled a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at saving jobs, including a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee retained to the end of January 2021. He also announced measures to benefit the hospitality sector, includinggiving diners 50% off eating out from Monday to Wednesday in August. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves to support restaurants, pubs and cafes could also help retail. ""We very much hope that when people go to their local pub or their restaurant to eat out, those are often in the centre of towns, hopefully that will encourage the footfall to those areas so we get more people going to our shops as well,"" Mr Dowden said, speaking after announcing the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and outdoor theatres. John Lewis says some of its stores were in trouble before the virus struck, while Boots already had plans for a shake-up. The crisis has forced them to speed up efforts to deal with the rise of internet shopping. And just now they face the phasing out of the government-supported furlough scheme, starting next month. One by one, retailers are revealing how many staff they will bring back into stores as the job subsidy is withdrawn. Most Boots outlets remained open throughout the lockdown to provide pharmacy and healthcare services, but the firm said footfall had ""dramatically reduced"". The firm said sales across all Boots UK outlets were down 50% in the third quarter, and some 70% at Boots Opticians. ""Restrictions are beginning to lift, but with an uncertain economic outlook, it is anticipated that the High Street will take considerable time to recover,"" it said. Boots said last year that it was reviewing the size of its UK operationswith the possibility that up to 200 stores could be closed. The managing director of Boots UK, Sebastian James, described the latest cuts as ""decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan"". John Lewis said the eight stores affected were already ""financially challenged"" even before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 had caused customers to move more quickly towards online shopping and away from stores. John Lewis Partnership chairwoman Sharon White said: ""Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today's announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners. ""However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership - and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop."" Ms White said John Lewis would do everything it could to keep on as many people as possible. John Lewis had warned in March it could close shopsas a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. Former John Lewis boss Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands, said the closure of the chain's flagship Birmingham store was ""deeply disappointing"". ""At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one which I believe risks being a dreadful mistake,""he tweeted,external. He added that his belief in its potential was ""unwavering"" and that he would be making the case for it to stay open. The planned closure of John Lewis's Watford store has prompteda petition to save it,external, which has been signed by 4,400 people so far. Other John Lewis customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""With no modification to the jobs retention scheme, that dreaded October cliff-edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. ""Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace."" Vivienne King, chief executive at Revo, which represents the retail property sector, warned that three million retail jobs remained in jeopardy unless the government undertook ""a fundamental review of business rates and direct financial support to underwrite rents"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak himself told BBC Breakfast: ""Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs? Yes, and the scale of this is significant. ""We are entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen. That is of course going to have a significant impact on unemployment and on job losses."" Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said the job cuts were ""deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots"" and described Mr Sunak's statement as ""a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it"".

"BT and Vodafone have said their UK customers would face mobile phone signal blackouts if they are given three years or less to strip Huawei's equipment out of their 5G networks. Executives from the network providers told MPs that they wanted at least five years, and ideally seven, if such an order were made. The government is expected to announce new curbs on the use of the Chinese firm's kit within the next two weeks. Huawei has urged it to take more time. ""There isn't a burning bridge,"" said Huawei's UK vice president Jeremy Thompson, adding that it was too soon to determine what impact new US sanctions would have. The company also denied claims it would ever act against its clients' interests, even if told to do so by the Chinese government. Testimony was given via video link because of the coronavirus pandemic The Science and Technology Committee hearing represents a last chance for companies to make their cases before government ahead of a decision being taken. In January, the government put a cap on Huawei's 5G market share, but decided that suggested security risks raised by allowing the Chinese firm to supply the country's telecoms providers could be managed. Since then, however, Washington has announcedfresh sanctions designed toprevent the company from having its own chips manufactured. As a consequence, Huawei faces having to source other companies' chips for use in its equipment. GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre is believed to have told the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that this means it can no longer assure the security of Huawei's products. While it now seems likely the government will opt for a ban of some sort, the question is when it will come into effect. Some Tory backbenchers are urging a deadline to be set before the 2024 general election - and there has been speculation that it could be as soon as 2023. But Vodafone and BT - which both use Huawei's products in their networks - said this would be hugely disruptive. UK government weighs up ban of Chinese firm's telecoms kit Ministers signal switch in policy over 5G policy Trump administration claims Huawei 'backed by Chinese military' ""To get to zero in a three-year period would literally mean blackouts for customers on 4G and 2G, as well as 5G, throughout the country,"" said Howard Watson, BT's chief technology and information officer. He explained the logistics involved in bringing in cranes and shutting off streets to replace masts, base stations and other Huawei equipment meant that the only way to meet the timespan would be to switch over multiple sites in an area at the same time. 3G signals would not be affected as the EE network uses Nokia kit to provide that service. Vodafone made a similar case - it uses Huawei's kit in its 2G, 3G. 4G and 5G networks. ""[Customers] would lose their signal, sometimes for a couple of days, depending on how big or how intrusive the work to be carried out is,"" said Andrea Dona, Vodafone UK's head of networks. ""I would say a five-year transition time would be the minimum,"" Mr Watson added: ""A minimum of five years, ideally seven."" Earlier in the hearing, Huawei made the case that it was too soon to decide on any new restrictions. Replacing Huawei's 5G equipment will often involve simultaneously swapping out its 4G base stations and antennas Executives said that the US had yet to confirm some of the details about the sanctions, adding they would subsequently need time to see if they could mitigate the impact. The company has built up stockpiles of its chips, and believes it could keep providing equipment based on them for some time to come. ""We can supply our customers with their orders and support the existing network with spares,"" said Mr Thompson. ""And in terms of who the alternative [chip] suppliers are, they're not just Chinese. There are European companies who are also in this space. ""We will be able to share those [details] with you, but that will take a few more weeks."" A spokeswoman for DCMS said she could not reveal whether the department had already handed over its recommendations to the prime minister. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to convene a meeting of the National Security Council within the coming days to discuss the possibility of a ban, which could also extend to the country's broadband infrastructure. The warnings from Vodafone and BT about disruption to customers if Huawei is removed swiftly sound stark - but, in fact, both firms have softened their stance. Last year they seemed determined to battle against any plan to exclude Huawei from the UK's 5G networks. Now they seem resigned to the fact that this is going to happen. Indeed, BT accepts that the threatened US sanctions could mean that within a couple of years, it won't be able to get hold of reliable Huawei equipment. Their emphasis now is on timing - they want to make sure the government does not proceed as rapidly as many Conservative backbenchers would like in stripping out the Chinese firms' kit. They understand how the political mood has changed, but will be warning ministers that disrupting mobile reception, or abandoning the target to get gigabit broadband to everyone by 2025, would also be bad politics.

"This video can not be played Trump: Supreme Court ruling a 'witch hunt' and 'hoax' The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump's financial records can be examined by prosecutors in New York. In a related case, the court ruled that this information did not have to be shared with Congress. Mr Trump has come under fire for not making his tax returns public like his predecessors. His lawyers had argued that he enjoyed total immunity while in office and that Congress had no valid justification to seek the records. How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book Two Democratic-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - had demanded Mr Trump's tax documents over several years in order to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were tough enough. Mr Trump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"". ""The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution,""he wrote in a series of tweets following the court rulings.,external In the case regarding the request from the New York prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled by a majority of seven to two that the president did not have absolute immunity from criminal investigation. ""Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,"" the court said. ""We reaffirm that principle today."" But the two cases regarding Congressional committees were closely watched, as they could have had implications on how far US lawmakers could scrutinise the activities of a sitting president. The court ruled that Congress had significant, but not limitless, power to request the president's personal information. In this case, the court returned the case to the lower courts. Those wanting to see President Donald Trump's tax returns before the November presidential election shouldn't hold their breath. In a series of high-stakes rulings on Thursday, the US Supreme Court swatted down the president's defence that, by dint of his high office, he was somehow above the law when it came to state-level criminal subpoenas. That's good news for the president's critics, advocates of limited executive power, and New York prosecutors seeking to investigate Trump's personal finances. The opinion is not-so-good news for anyone wanting a quick resolution to this case, however. Chief Justice John Roberts sent the lawsuit back down to the lower courts and offered a few new legal avenues for Mr Trump's lawyers to pursue that could continue to put off a day when the president's accounting firm ultimately hands over the documents. And if that day comes, there's still no guarantee that the request, by a secret grand jury, will ever lead to a public disclosure. In the other case, involving a request by congressional Democrats for Mr Trump's financial records, the court was even more circumspect. It simply punted the case down to the lower court with instructions to further balance presidential privileges with legislative power. The gears of justice will grind even more slowly there. While legally these decisions may have been, at best, a draw for the president, by pushing the final day of reckoning further down the road, it's a political win. Two of the cases centred on the ability of the House intelligence, oversight and financial services committees to compel Deutsche Bank and Mazars USA, Mr Trump's long-time accounting firm, to turn over his tax and financial documents. The committees argued that they needed this information to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were sufficiently rigorous. The case of Trump v Vance was based on on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's criminal subpoena - an order to hand over evidence. Mr Vance argued Mr Trump's documents were needed to determine if financial records had been doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Following the ruling Mr Vance said the investigation into Mr Trump's financial affairs would resume. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she would continue to campaign for Mr Trump's financial records to be handed over to Congress. ""Congress will continue to conduct oversight for the people, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our constitution,"" she told reporters. It is not clear whether this will happen. Even if Mr Trump's financial records are turned over to prosecutors, they may remain hidden from public view until charges are filed.

"The US Supreme Court is set to decide whether President Donald Trump's tax returns and other financial records can be examined by Congress and prosecutors - a ruling with potentially huge political consequences. Mr Trump refuses to share documents concerning his fortune and business. His lawyers argue he enjoys total immunity while in office. The ruling will test that claim and has implications on how far US lawmakers can scrutinise the president. Even a ruling in Congress's favour would not necessarily make Mr Trump's tax returns public before his bid for re-election in November. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Richard Nixon in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. He calls the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"" and sees the congressional case as a device to harass him politically. Two Democrat-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - are demanding the release of his tax returns and other information. The subpoenas - orders to hand over evidence - were issued last year to Mazars USA, who are Mr Trump's accountants, and to major Trump lenders Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Lower courts in Washington and New York ruled against the presidentin all cases, but those decisions have been put on hold pending a final court ruling. Trump loses court case to keep tax returns secret Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book Trump tax returns 'will never be released' Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Deutsche Bank was one of the few banks willing to lend to Mr Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies in the 1990s, and the documents sought include records related to the president, the Trump Organization and his family. The banks and the accounting firm said they would release the information if ordered. Mr Trump's lawyers argued that Congress had no authority to issue the subpoenas, and no valid justification to seek the records. The judges are hearing the cases remotely because of the coronavirus Damaging revelations about President Trump's financial affairs could hurt his campaign for re-election. He has already slumped in opinion polls, as critics accuse him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis. The New York investigation covers alleged hush money payments made by Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to two women - adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - who both say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Such payments could violate campaign financing laws. The president denies the affairs took place. Concerns have already been raised about possible conflicts of interest in Mr Trump's businesses. At hearings in May there was fierce debate among the Supreme Court judges over the degree to which Congress should scrutinise the president's personal records. In the New York case, they were sceptical about a Trump lawyer's argument that a president cannot be investigated while in office. This is despite the court having a 5-4 conservative majority and including two Trump appointees - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In two earlier cases over presidential power, in 1974 the Supreme Court acted unanimously in requiring President Nixon to surrender White House tapes in the Watergate scandal, and in 1997 it allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to go ahead against President Bill Clinton. Judges appointed by Mr Nixon and Mr Clinton voted against them in the cases. Trump loses court case to keep tax returns secret Trump's family: What do we know of them?

"Taxpayers face a day of reckoning when the government's massive coronavirus support measures have to be paid off, experts warn. The Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank says the economy will remain in a ""support and recovery"" phase for some time, but higher taxes are inevitable. On Wednesday, the chancellor unveiled another Â£30bn of support, bringing the total cost to Â£190bn. But it was revealed the UK's tax authority queried its value for money. The most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about the value of two measures in his summer statement - the Job Retention Bonus and the eating out support. Wednesday's additional spending announced by Mr Sunak is worth nearly Â£3,000 for every person in the UK - and more than the entire planned health budget for 2020-21. It also means that the cost of the crisis so far has risen by more than 40% since last month, when the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,estimated it at Â£133bn,external. Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Rishi Sunak: We can't protect every job Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? On Thursday, in its analysis of the latest measures, the IFS predicted that government borrowing would surge to about Â£350bn this year. In March, the government forecast a deficit of about Â£50bn to Â£60bn this year. The IFS said it expected further spending support in the autumn Budget, perhaps through targeted tax cuts. However, IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Let's hold in the back of our minds that a reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually. ""This is no normal recession. It's the deepest in history,"" Mr Johnson said. The IFS said annual borrowing as a share of the economy was on course to be its highest outside wartime in more than 300 years. Mr Sunak has given few details about how he intends to pay for the huge public spending, but has previously refused to rule out tax rises. There are some things no chancellor can prepare for - such as what to do if your economy wipes out 18 years' gains in two months of lockdown. His solution was to temporarily deep freeze the economy, and pump money into crisis response. And the thawing process needs more funds, to prevent long term damage. Now economists are talking about a deficit, a shortfall of way more than the Â£300bn previously expected. It's equivalent to a bigger slice of the economy than at any time since the Second World War. And it could get bigger; if more is needed to support the recovery - or in the event of a severe second wave. But it's a cost worth bearing if it carries the economy through a devastating crisis, safeguard the damage to output and jobs -  and ensure taxes get paid. For at some point, there will have to be a discussion about how we pay this back. The government is currently borrowing record amounts on the financial markets to plug the gap - but that may not be enough. There may have to be tax hikes, possibly less generous rises in pensions. But it may be a while until the economy is robust enough to bear that. Of the policy measures announced in Wednesday's summer statement, the biggest was the plan to pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. The total bill could rise as high as Â£9.4bn, but only if every furloughed worker keeps their job. But Mr Johnson said there was a ""value for money issue"" about the scheme. ""A lot, probably a majority, of the job retention bonus money will go in respect of jobs that would have been, indeed already have been, returned from furlough anyway,"" he said. And he said much of the planned cuts in VAT and stamp duty ""will be deadweight"". It has also emerged that the UK tax authority had some doubts. Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, wrote to the chancellor earlier this week about the Job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out policies. On both, he said, advice received by HMRC and the Treasury ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the proposals. However, the correspondence showed the chancellor said the plans should go ahead because there was a ""compelling case"". Businessman Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, also questioned if the job retention bonus was money well spent, as he thought some firms would only retain staff until they get the cash. ""Firms will either want their staff back, or they won't. I just feel some employers will take advantage of this scheme,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Meanwhile, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the financial cost of the crisis, at Â£190bn so far, was ""approaching the amount we spend on the day-to-day running of our NHS, schools and colleges each year"". He welcomed the focus on supporting young people and sectors most affected by lockdown, but added: ""The scale of support... risks falling short of what will be required. The chancellor is taking quite a gamble on the strength of the recovery in the months ahead."" JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

"The US Supreme Court is set to decide whether President Donald Trump's tax returns and other financial records can be examined by Congress and prosecutors - a ruling with potentially huge political consequences. Mr Trump refuses to share documents concerning his fortune and business. His lawyers argue he enjoys total immunity while in office. The ruling will test that claim and has implications on how far US lawmakers can scrutinise the president. Even a ruling in Congress's favour would not necessarily make Mr Trump's tax returns public before his bid for re-election in November. Mr Trump, who inherited money from his father and went on to become a property developer, is the first president since Richard Nixon in the 1970s not to have made his tax returns public. He calls the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"" and sees the congressional case as a device to harass him politically. Two Democrat-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - are demanding the release of his tax returns and other information. The subpoenas - orders to hand over evidence - were issued last year to Mazars USA, who are Mr Trump's accountants, and to major Trump lenders Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Lower courts in Washington and New York ruled against the presidentin all cases, but those decisions have been put on hold pending a final court ruling. Trump loses court case to keep tax returns secret Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book Trump tax returns 'will never be released' Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Deutsche Bank was one of the few banks willing to lend to Mr Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies in the 1990s, and the documents sought include records related to the president, the Trump Organization and his family. The banks and the accounting firm said they would release the information if ordered. Mr Trump's lawyers argued that Congress had no authority to issue the subpoenas, and no valid justification to seek the records. The judges are hearing the cases remotely because of the coronavirus Damaging revelations about President Trump's financial affairs could hurt his campaign for re-election. He has already slumped in opinion polls, as critics accuse him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis. The New York investigation covers alleged hush money payments made by Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to two women - adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - who both say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Such payments could violate campaign financing laws. The president denies the affairs took place. Concerns have already been raised about possible conflicts of interest in Mr Trump's businesses. At hearings in May there was fierce debate among the Supreme Court judges over the degree to which Congress should scrutinise the president's personal records. In the New York case, they were sceptical about a Trump lawyer's argument that a president cannot be investigated while in office. This is despite the court having a 5-4 conservative majority and including two Trump appointees - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In two earlier cases over presidential power, in 1974 the Supreme Court acted unanimously in requiring President Nixon to surrender White House tapes in the Watergate scandal, and in 1997 it allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to go ahead against President Bill Clinton. Judges appointed by Mr Nixon and Mr Clinton voted against them in the cases. Trump loses court case to keep tax returns secret Trump's family: What do we know of them?

"The chancellor has said he is ""sorry"" for not helping ""everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted"". Rishi Sunak said the government was ""throwing everything"" at stemming job losses with a Â£30bn stimulus package. But he told the BBC he will not be able to protect ""every single job"" as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". He also admitted that some of the Â£1,000 bonuses being offered to take back furloughed staff would go to firms that were already keeping workers on. Labour has called for a more targeted approach to saving jobs, saying the government will ""waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support"". Anger as locked-down Leicester denied extra cash Taxes will rise to pay for virus, says think tank Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance In his summer statement on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the ""jobs retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9bn if every worker currently furloughed is kept on. Meanwhile, it has emerged the most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs did not back two of the key policies in Mr Sunak's summer statement over uncertainty about their value for money. In letters to the chancellor, Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, said advice received by HMRC ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out scheme - which gives diners money off some meals in August. Self-employed curtain fitter Mark Whittaker told BBC Breakfast he cannot ""get his head round how the chancellor expects any citizen of this country to get by on zero income"". ""If he can manage it, please tell me how to do it,"" Mr Whittaker said. ""I don't want a handoutâ¦ I want parity."" This video can not be played âI donât want a handoutâ¦ I want parity and thatâs it.â Mr Whittaker started his own business in Stockport, Greater Manchester, towards the end of 2018 and fell short of earnings requirements to receive support during the crisis. He said people in his situation have children, mortgages, rent and bills to pay. Responding to Mr Whittaker's comments, Mr Sunak said more than 2.5 million people who are self-employed will receive support from a ""generous"" scheme of government funding. He added: ""Have we been able to help everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted? I'm sure not and I've said previously that we haven't been able to do that and for that I am sorry."" Mr Sunak warned the UK was ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"". ""If you're asking me 'can I protect every single job' of course the answer is no,"" he said. ""'Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs?' Yes, and the scale of this is significant."" It comes as figures released by the Treasury reveal that public spending on the battle against coronavirushas risen to nearly Â£190bn. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the UK was not in a ""normal recession"" but ""the deepest in history"". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)estimates that unemployment in the UK will reach ""record highs"",externalof up to 11.7% by the end of 2020, without a second wave of coronavirus. With a second wave, it says UK unemployment could reach near 15%. The chancellor announced a series of measures to help the economy on Wednesday, including a VAT cut for the hospitality and tourism sectors, a bonus scheme for employers and an eating out money off scheme for August. Mr Sunak said the Â£1,000 bonus being offered to businesses that keep furloughed staff in jobs until January would be a ""dead weight"" cost, as some employers who intend to retain workers anyway would benefit. The Chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Throughout this crisis I've had decisions to make and whether to act in a broad way at scale and at speed or to act in a more targeted and nuanced way. ""In an ideal world, you're absolutely right, you would minimise that dead weight and do everything in incredibly targeted fashion. ""The problem is the severity of what was happening to our economy, the scale of what was happening, and indeed the speed that it was happening at demanded a different response."" He said that ""without question there will be dead weight - and there has been dead weight in all of the interventions we have put in place"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Philipson said: ""The chancellor should be targeting support on those who need it, not handing it out aimlessly to those who don't. ""It's not brave to admit the government plans to waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support."" Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October.

"UK airlines have said they are being ""ignored"" by the government after not being included in a fresh wave of economic stimulus to counter the effects of coronavirus. Industry body Airlines UK warned of further job losses after tens of thousands of job cuts. Gyms also said they were ignored, and retailers called for tax breaks. The government had earlier said it had put in place ""one of most comprehensive economic responses in the world"". The UK aviation sector has repeatedly called for more aid from the government as it grapples with the plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The industry has announced many thousands of job losses over the past months. Traffic in April and May fell more than 90% as airlines were hit by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. Demand is not expected to pick back up to its previous level for three years, but airlines still face costs, such as leasing aircraft, that they have to pay. The fresh set of measures Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday to help the UK economy included dinersgetting 50% off their restaurant billsduring Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August to stimulate the hospitality sector, anda reduction in stamp dutyto aid the housing sector. However, Airlines UK reacted angrily to the plans, saying its members had been left out. ""Tens of thousands of jobs lost in aviation and a winter season where we're likely to see connectivity slashed,"" a spokesman said. ""Now the Prime Minister has said the furlough scheme will end in October. Something needs to give and if the government continues to ignore aviation we're going to see our regional airports with fewer connections and more jobs lost across aviation and aerospace."" The expectation that the government's furlough scheme will end in Octoberin part helped to drive the timing of thousands of job cutslast week, many of which fell in the retail sector. The retail industry said it had hoped for aid like the tax break Mr Sunak announced on Wednesday for the hospitality sector. The government lowered VAT on hospitality and tourism to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. ""It was disappointing that the Chancellor did not extend this measure to the retail industry and the three million people it employs,"" the British Retail Consortium said. ""It was a missed opportunity and we hope that the government will reconsider this ahead of the autumn Budget."" However, the BRC said it welcomed the Chancellor's ""huge support"" for employment and training, which included a Job Retention Bonus ofÂ£1,000 per furloughed employee still employed at the end of January. Although businesses such as pubs have been allowed to reopen, other firms such as gyms have not. Pure Gym employs just over 1,500 workers across 265 sites, as well as providing work for 3,500 self-employed personal trainers. Humphrey Cobbold, the chief executive of PureGym, said that the gym and fitness sector ""has been forgotten and ignored."" ""It is all very well opening pubs and restaurants - and now subsidising their trade with massive VAT discounts and unlimited meal vouchers - but to be honest it beggars belief that thousands of hard working gym and fitness operators are being left high and dry with no specific support."" ""And let's remember, unlike pubs and restaurants, many of whom have been able to earn revenue from off sales and takeaways, gym and fitness operators have had zero revenue for 110 days."" Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunakresponded to a question in the House of Commons,externalsaying he hoped the government could make progress on reopening gyms, and that airlines and aviation ""are experiencing a difficult period."" ""I remain in close contact with the industry and with individual companies to understand what is happening, and if there are things that we can and should do, of course we will,"" he said. Later, ina speech laying out the latest government stimulus plans,external, he said: ""While we can't protect every job, one of the most important things we can do to prevent unemployment, is to get as many people as possible from furlough back to their jobs."" He then laid out details of the jobs retention bonus, saying: ""Our message to business is clear: if you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.""

It's the first confirmed death penalty in China related to the country's efforts to contain coronavirus. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg In an apocalyptic warning, a South African health official suggested that half a million graves were being dug in the province of Gauteng to help cemeteries cope with the wave of coronavirus deaths. Dr Bandile Masuku, head of the province's health authorities, made the announcement during a television interview, but his office quickly explained that the actual number was far smaller. So why mention that figure at all? The general assumption is that he was deliberately seeking to spread alarm in a country where the virus has been slow to spread, and where the public has, as a result, begun to drop its guard. In recent days, the infection rate around Johannesburg has been rising sharply, and hospitals here, and in other big municipalities, are already struggling - with reports of oxygen shortages, a lack of beds, and personal protective equipment. South Africa has had months to prepare for this storm. Those preparations are now being tested, and in some places, are being ruthlessly exposed.

Speaking at a virtual summit for clean energy today, Guterres said some countries were using their economic recovery packages to support fossil fuel companies that were already struggling financially. Others are jump-starting coal-fired power plants, including developing countries who argue that coal is necessary for growth. ""Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans,"" Guterres said.

Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Slovakia's prime minister Igor Matovic has said his
country might have to reintroduce restrictions, after the country recorded the
single biggest daily increase in Covid-19 infections since 22 April. Matovic said epidemiologists would meet on Monday to discuss the matter. The number of new infections recorded on Wednesday was
53, bringing the total to 1,851. Some 1,477 people have recovered from the
virus, and 28 have died. Slovakia has so far been credited with some of the lowest
infection rates in Europe, as well as what were some of the strictest measures. BBC Radio 5 Live Helen Wong, owner of the

Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg In an apocalyptic warning, a South African health official suggested that half a million graves were being dug in the province of Gauteng to help cemeteries cope with the wave of coronavirus deaths. Dr Bandile Masuku, head of the province's health authorities, made the announcement during a television interview, but his office quickly explained that the actual number was far smaller. So why mention that figure at all? The general assumption is that he was deliberately seeking to spread alarm in a country where the virus has been slow to spread, and where the public has, as a result, begun to drop its guard. In recent days, the infection rate around Johannesburg has been rising sharply, and hospitals here, and in other big municipalities, are already struggling - with reports of oxygen shortages, a lack of beds, and personal protective equipment. South Africa has had months to prepare for this storm. Those preparations are now being tested, and in some places, are being ruthlessly exposed.

me her grief is mixed with rage. She blames the Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey

"Energy companies have criticised proposals by the industry's regulator to cut customers' bills and spend more on green investments. Under Ofgem's plans, households could see their bills cut by Â£20 a year while firms spend Â£25bn over five years to invest in the UK's energy network. Ofgem said it wanted ""a greener, fairer energy system for consumers"". However, National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power all said that the regulator's plans were flawed. The energy regulator sets out price controls which dictate how much money gas and electricity companies can earn, while allowing them sufficient scope to fund new investment from customers' bills. Under its latest proposals, which run from 2021 to 2026, they will be allowed to spend Â£25bn on improving gas and electricity networks and recoup this cost from customers. Some Â£3bn will be used to make the electricity network more environmentally friendly, while more than Â£1bn will go towards green energy research and reducing the networks' own impact on the environment. In order to reduce the cost to consumers, Ofgem says, the return energy firms will be allowed to make from their investments will be nearly halved. The regulator said this would mean that ""less of consumers' money goes towards network companies' profits, and more towards driving network improvements"". Ofgem estimated that cutting returns would save more than Â£3.3bn over the next five years, which should cut household bills by about Â£20 a year. The regulator added that investing in the energy network of the UK was low-risk and should be an attractive option to investors. ""Strong evidence from water regulation and Ofgem's offshore transmission regime shows that investors will accept lower returns and continue to invest robustly in the sector,"" it said. Ofgem also said it would provide firms with additional funding for green projects from its own coffers, with Â£10bn worth of such schemes already under consideration. Citizens Advice said the move could put an end to energy firms ""overcharging energy customers by billions of pounds"". ""Ofgem has struck the right balance between shareholder returns and value for money for energy customers, while making sure networks can continue to attract investment,"" said Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. Uswitch.com., the comparison website, also welcomed the move. ""The amount of profit that network companies have been allowed to make in recent years has been a matter of significant controversy, given our energy suppliers have to pass on these charges to our bills."" Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again However, National Grid said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the plans. ""This proposal leaves us concerned as to our ability to deliver resilient and reliable networks, and jeopardises the delivery of the energy transition and the green recovery."" Energy firm SSE said the proposal was likely to be challenged through the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). ""Ofgem's first pass at a settlement resembles a worrying return to austerity,"" Rob McDonald, the managing director of transmission at SSE, said. ""At present the draft settlement does not strike the right balance for all stakeholders and without significant changes during the consultation period, there is a real risk that the critical investment in Britain's electricity networks will be unnecessarily slowed down by an appeal process via the CMA, which is not in any stakeholders' interests."" Scottish Power called Ofgem's plans ""a massive missed opportunity"". ""Instead of investing more in creating green jobs and skilled apprenticeships in every community, at a time when the UK needs them most, this is a short-sighted return to austerity politics. ""Nobody benefits from this half-baked plan. It's bad for jobs, bad for apprenticeships, bad for training and bad for the UK supply chain. ""Net Zero can be an accelerator of the economic recovery, but only if private companies are given the right conditions for investment. Slamming the door in investors' faces by offering one of the lowest rates of return of any developed country traps the UK in an economic cul-de-sac.""

viable. Oxford University says it will run an in-house Covid-19 testing
service for students and staff from September. The university said its testing system - based at sites in the city centre and Headington - would ""protect our
local community"" and ease the burden on local NHS facilities. It also says research and teaching spaces will be ""adapted
to ensure social distancing and appropriate ventilation"" for the start of term. Libraries will operate social distancing, with a seat-finder app
planned to help students. Face coverings will be required during face-to-face teaching and
in indoor shared spaces - and cleaning will be ""significantly
enhanced"", it added. BBC OS The city of Bergamo in
northern Italy was one of the worst-hit areas by Covid-19 in the country. But now, after 137 days,
the intensive care unit in the city's main hospital, Papa Giovanni XXIII, has
no positive Covid-19 cases. Dr Luca Lorini is the
head of the intensive care unit and emergency department at the hospital. He's been speaking toBBC OS on
World Service radio. ""When we started,
in the first week, we didn't expect so many patients. But it was clear at the
end of the first week that a lot of patients in the region were infected with
Covid-19. ""We worked so hard
in March, April and May. We used more than 100% of our capability,
starting early in the morning trying to find materials, beds, ventilators. It
was three months of very hard work. ""But at the end of
April I observed a downward curve, so we have been expecting this."" Dr Lorini says that the
ICU now has just 72 patients, none of them Covid-positive, and looks like it
did before the coronavirus pandemic. ""It's incredible
because you don't have to use so much protection. So you feel free. You can
drink coffee... the atmosphere is much more comfortable."" However, he says they
still need to be alert for a possible second wave. ""We have to prepare
for the future, because we don't know what will happen. No science, no doctor,
nobody knows."" The Minack Theatre in Cornwall was cited as one venue that can reopen If you're just joining us, here's a reminder about open-air gigs, festivals and theatre shows in England. They can resume from this weekend, as long as they have ""a limited and socially distanced audience"", the government says. Outdoor performances can go ahead from Saturday 11 July.

"George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The US police officer accused of George Floyd's murder told him to stop talking as he repeatedly gasped under the man's knee, according to court documents. The unarmed black man cried out for his late mother and children as he said the Minneapolis policeman would kill him, transcripts from body-cam footage show. They were disclosed in court by lawyers for one of the four officers involved. The documents offer the clearest picture yet of Mr Floyd's last moments. His death in May sparked global uproar. It led to a wave of anti-racism protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement, and stirred debate and reflection in the US over the country's history of slavery and segregation. All four officers involved in taking Mr Floyd into custody were fired and arrested. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck, faces several charges including second-degree murder, while the other three - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting murder. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life What US police officers think of protests What's changed since George Floyd's death? The transcripts were made public on Thursday as Mr Lane's lawyers asked for the case against him to be dismissed. Warning: Some readers may find the content below distressing. Until now, eyewitness footage shared on social media revealed most of what was known about Mr Floyd's arrest and his final moments. The new transcripts give a more detailed account,external, shedding light on significant parts of the encounter, from the time Mr Lane and Mr Kueng arrived at the scene, to the point where Mr Floyd was given CPR in an ambulance. Transcripts of footage recorded by body cameras fitted to Mr Lane and Mr Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers in a Minneapolis street. They confronted him outside a convenience store where he was suspected of having used a forged $20 note to buy cigarettes. At one point, a handcuffed Mr Floyd, while pinned down on the road next to the police car, gasps that he cannot breathe, adding: ""You're going to kill me, man."" This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting Mr Chauvin, who is shown in bystander footage appearing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. ""It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk."" The transcripts show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Mr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. In response to one of the demands to see his hands, Mr Floyd says: ""Man, I got, I got shot the same way, Mr Officer, before."" It is not clear what he is referring to. This video can not be played Why monuments in the US are being taken down At one point Mr Lane says: ""Why's he getting all squirrelly and not showing us his hands and just being all weird like that?"" The officers then handcuff Mr Floyd and try to put him into the back of their police car. As they do, Mr Floyd becomes agitated, repeatedly pleading that he is claustrophobic. Mr Lane asks if he is ""on something"". Mr Floyd replies: ""I'm scared, man."" According to another document, Mr Lane told investigators that once in the car, Mr Floyd began ""thrashing back and forth"". When asked ""So he pushed himself out of the car?"" Mr Lane replied: ""Yeah"". The investigator then asks: ""Versus you guys pulling him out of the car?"" and Mr Lane says: ""Yeah, because the goal is to keep him in the car, we didn't want him coming out again."" Pinned on the ground, according to the transcript, Mr Floyd cries out a dozen times: ""Mama."" What we know about the officers charged over his death He says: ""Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. ""Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead."" Thomas Lane was just days into the job when the incident happened At one point, when Mr Floyd continues to plead he can't breathe, Mr Lane asks Mr Chauvin: ""Should we roll him on his side?"" Mr Chauvin responds: ""No, he's staying put where we got him."" Mr Lane then says: ""Okay. Just worry about the excited delirium or whatever."" Mr Chauvin replies: ""Well that's why we got the ambulance coming,"" and Mr Lane says ""Okay, I suppose"". Mr Chauvin's lawyers have not commented on the documents since they were made public. This video can not be played In June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd's death The transcripts were released in support of a legal bid to dismiss the criminal charges against Mr Lane, a new recruit only days into the job when Mr Floyd's death happened. Mr Lane's lawyer Earl Gray, who filed the documents, argued that it was ""not fair or reasonable"" for his client to stand trial on the charges. The new court documents includea transcript of Mr Lane's interview with investigators,externalfrom Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. In the interview, Mr Lane talked through the first crucial moments of his encounter with Mr Floyd. Mr Lane said he had pulled his gun out and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands after approaching his car and seeing him ""sitting with his hands down below the seat"". Pictures from inside the car Mr Floyd was sitting in before his arrest show two crumpled $20 bills that, according to Mr Gray, were counterfeit. Mr Lane's lawyer said two fake $20 bills were found in the car Mr Floyd was sitting in At the end of the interview, one of the investigators asked Mr Lane if he felt either he or Mr Chauvin had contributed to Mr Floyd's death. ""I object to that. You're not going to answer that,"" Mr Gray said. The incident and the bystander videos that exposed it highlighted deep wounds over racial inequality in the US. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflected years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally. This video can not be played President Trump posed for a photo op outside a church, moments after protesters were cleared by police Police forces, governments and businesses pledged reforms in recognition of the racial inequality that fuelled the protests. Monuments to historical figures with links to slavery in the US and other countries were re-assessed. Some were toppled or vandalised, others were taken down by authorities and institutions. Mr Floyd's death followed the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Why US protests are so powerful this time Five pieces of context to understand protests Tipping point for racially divided nation 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"The chancellor has said he is ""sorry"" for not helping ""everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted"". Rishi Sunak said the government was ""throwing everything"" at stemming job losses with a Â£30bn stimulus package. But he told the BBC he will not be able to protect ""every single job"" as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". He also admitted that some of the Â£1,000 bonuses being offered to take back furloughed staff would go to firms that were already keeping workers on. Labour has called for a more targeted approach to saving jobs, saying the government will ""waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support"". Anger as locked-down Leicester denied extra cash Taxes will rise to pay for virus, says think tank Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance In his summer statement on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the ""jobs retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9bn if every worker currently furloughed is kept on. Meanwhile, it has emerged the most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs did not back two of the key policies in Mr Sunak's summer statement over uncertainty about their value for money. In letters to the chancellor, Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, said advice received by HMRC ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out scheme - which gives diners money off some meals in August. Self-employed curtain fitter Mark Whittaker told BBC Breakfast he cannot ""get his head round how the chancellor expects any citizen of this country to get by on zero income"". ""If he can manage it, please tell me how to do it,"" Mr Whittaker said. ""I don't want a handoutâ¦ I want parity."" This video can not be played âI donât want a handoutâ¦ I want parity and thatâs it.â Mr Whittaker started his own business in Stockport, Greater Manchester, towards the end of 2018 and fell short of earnings requirements to receive support during the crisis. He said people in his situation have children, mortgages, rent and bills to pay. Responding to Mr Whittaker's comments, Mr Sunak said more than 2.5 million people who are self-employed will receive support from a ""generous"" scheme of government funding. He added: ""Have we been able to help everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted? I'm sure not and I've said previously that we haven't been able to do that and for that I am sorry."" Mr Sunak warned the UK was ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"". ""If you're asking me 'can I protect every single job' of course the answer is no,"" he said. ""'Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs?' Yes, and the scale of this is significant."" It comes as figures released by the Treasury reveal that public spending on the battle against coronavirushas risen to nearly Â£190bn. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the UK was not in a ""normal recession"" but ""the deepest in history"". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)estimates that unemployment in the UK will reach ""record highs"",externalof up to 11.7% by the end of 2020, without a second wave of coronavirus. With a second wave, it says UK unemployment could reach near 15%. The chancellor announced a series of measures to help the economy on Wednesday, including a VAT cut for the hospitality and tourism sectors, a bonus scheme for employers and an eating out money off scheme for August. Mr Sunak said the Â£1,000 bonus being offered to businesses that keep furloughed staff in jobs until January would be a ""dead weight"" cost, as some employers who intend to retain workers anyway would benefit. The Chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Throughout this crisis I've had decisions to make and whether to act in a broad way at scale and at speed or to act in a more targeted and nuanced way. ""In an ideal world, you're absolutely right, you would minimise that dead weight and do everything in incredibly targeted fashion. ""The problem is the severity of what was happening to our economy, the scale of what was happening, and indeed the speed that it was happening at demanded a different response."" He said that ""without question there will be dead weight - and there has been dead weight in all of the interventions we have put in place"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Philipson said: ""The chancellor should be targeting support on those who need it, not handing it out aimlessly to those who don't. ""It's not brave to admit the government plans to waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support."" Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October.

One therapist told Drivetime earlier that she had reopened for business this week on account of advice from the Scottish government only to be told to close last night by national clinical director Jason Leitch. ""I don't know the detail about that but will go away and find out about it,"" Mr Swinney tells host John Beattie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Opening pubs and restaurants has left the Scottish government more nervous now than at any time in its process of easing lockdown, Deputy First Minister John Swinney admits. Asked by Drivetime if he has concerns about pubs, he replies: ""I do. This is the most nervous part of the process we've been in so far because we're opening up parts of society we know have the potential to spread the virus quite significantly simply by the nature of their structure and the interaction between individuals. ""The country has done very well in reducing the incidence of the virus, but a lot of that has been down to the absence of social interaction."" Chris McLaughlinBBC Scotland Sports News correspondent The first minister is to give the go-ahead for a limited
number of fans to return to sports venues within weeks. Itâs unlikely the new
SPFL Premiership season will kick off at the start of August with gates open to
supporters but test events are likely to be allowed in a bid to get fans back
much quicker than anticipated. The move comes just over a week after government
advisors said it was unlikely fans would be back before October. It is
subject to no resurgence in Corona virus cases and social-distancing measures
being in place. The number of fans allowed for each venue has yet to be
determined. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney has expressed surprise that some private dentists ""are open and drilling"" despite the Scottish government saying that only non-aerosol treatments can move forward in the current phase of lockdown easing. Host John Beattie explains that private dentists claim they can carry out such work because they have appropriate PPE and are not government by NHS restrictions. Promising to ""make sure that is properly examined"", Mr Swinney replies that: ""You are asking me about a level of detail that I can't answer, so I am not going to make any attempt to do so. ""The first minister said today that non-aerosol routine care was able to be taken forward, but essentially the treatment requiring aerosol treatment could not be taken forward, so I am more than a bit surprised to hear that."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland In My Father's Words, a Dundee Rep production went to New York The news that outdoor live events will not be permitted and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres and music venues will remain shut until at least the end of July will have come as no surprise. Liam
Sinclair, co-chair of the
Federation of Scottish Theatre, says the organisation ""broadly welcomes the clarity"" and had been asking for a not-before date. Mr Sinclair, also the joint CEO of Dundee Rep Theatre, says the coming weeks afford ""a window to make sure we get it right"" both in terms of public health and the economics. ""We need a significant number of people in our venues to make them viable,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stricter restrictions were eventually lifted in Annan (pictured), Gretna, Dumfries, Lockerbie, Langholm and Canonbie An assurance has been given that people asked to self-isolate by Scotland's Test and Protect system are doing so following scepticism expressed by a member of the independent SAGE scientific committee. Responding on BBC Radio Scotland to earlier remarks from Prof Allyson Pollock, Deputy First Minister John Swinney refers to the seemingly successful action taken in light of a cluster of infections in Dumfries & Galloway. ""The contract tracers really did a superb job in contacting individuals, they identified who they were, they interviewed them about their contacts and they then went to the contacts and asked those individuals to isolate,"" he says. ""What we then saw from the incident management team that looked at that example was that the were able to confidently assure us that the cluster in Dumfries and Galloway had been contained because they had got to the end of the contract trails of all the individuals involved and all the individuals were complying."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Ducks Inn in Aberlady Hospitality businesses need more clarity about what the requirements will be now that the social distancing rules will be reduced to 1m, the owner of the Ducks Inn Hotel in Aberlady, East Lothian, tells BBC Radio Scotland. Malcolm Duck says he has received conflicting advice from the local council's environmental health department and the police. ""I can't find anything on any website to tell us what we are doing,"" he says. ""We have a lot of work to do to get ready and we need to know the messaging."" As Scotland moves into the next phase of easing the lockdown, here are the changes you need to know about tomorrow: Face coverings are mandatory in shops from tomorrow  Find out the other changes coming in July here.

Deputy First Minister John Swinney will be on Drivetime after the news, you can listen with us here on this live page. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Massage therapy continues with PPE in the United States Sports and remedial massage therapist Beth Vance feels let down by the Scottish government after initially being told she could start her business this week only to receive an email last night from national clinical director Jason Leitch saying she had to stop again. She tells BBC Radio Scotland that her parent body, the Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation, had quoted the government saying she could restart because her treatment was for people with chronic pain. ""So I spent the entire weekend getting everything ready,"" she says. That included gathering PPE, infrared thermometers, a risk assessment of her work space, followed by a ""test run on Monday with a friend"". Ms Vance saw paying clients on Tuesday and Wednesday but had to cancel appointments today following Prof Leitch's email. She admits she had originally resigned herself to being allowed to open at the end of this month or start of August along with others like beauty therapists but says: ""I just want the government to be clear about what is happening."" Ms Vance finds it strange that therapists such as herself, who treat patients with conditions like cerebral palsy and multiple scleroris, are unable to work while the government has eased the lockdown for ""people to sit in pubs for up to two hours socialising for the sake having a pint or two"". The Scottish government has been asked to respond. The first minister revealed earlier there were some activities included in phase three of the route map to which we are not yet able to attach a specific date. It should be assumed at this stage
that these other activities will not restart before 31 July, although this will be kept under review: Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Are people self-isolating when being told they have been in contact with someone testing positive for Covid-19? Well, we don't know because we don't have any information on it, argues Allyson Pollock, Professor of Public Health at Newcastle
University and a member of the Independent SAGE committee. Professor Pollock is delighted to see the rate of infections drop in Scotland but says: ""The concern now will be around whether there are enough systems in place to identify cases and outbreaks and to act on them properly. ""We still don't have any information on contacts and if they are isolating when contacted. Or if any of these contacts are becoming cases. The Test and Protect data appears to stop as soon as they've asked people to self-quarantine."" Professor Pollock tells John: ""Staying at home for 14 days is a really big call on people when financial livelihoods are at stake. ""We need to know if people are doing as they've been asked and they are being financially supported and their housing is supported. Some countries go as far as putting people into hotels. ""This is the vital bit of the Test and Protect policy. It's no good finding the contacts and then not quarantining because then they are just spreading the virus."" Here's the Scottish government information on:Test and Protect,external If you have Covid-19 symptoms go immediately to NHS Inform online or phone 0800 028 2816 to book a test The wearing of face coverings - which was already compulsory on buses, trains, trams, planes and taxis -will be mandatory in shopsfrom Friday. You might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's theBBC's guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. The
next set of changes will take effect from 22 July: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Face coverings are becoming more fashionable Don't rely on just one mask or face covering, NHS Grampian's divisional general manager of public health told BBC Radio Scotland earlier today. Face coverings are already mandatory on public transport in Scotland and the same becomes true tomorrow in shops and other enclosed indoor spaces. Jillian Evans pointed out that, as soon as you take off a face covering, you could potentially contaminate it and it should not be used again until it is washed. ""There's not a huge point in just having one mask in your bag that you take off and put on throughout the day,"" she says. ""My advice would be keep the mask on the whole time you are shopping. If you can remain two metres apart during your day, it reduces your need to wear a mask. ""So plan ahead, make sure you have enough masks, keep socially distant where you can, don't put the same mask on again twice."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The US police officer accused of George Floyd's murder told him to stop talking as he repeatedly gasped under the man's knee, according to court documents. The unarmed black man cried out for his late mother and children as he said the Minneapolis policeman would kill him, transcripts from body-cam footage show. They were disclosed in court by lawyers for one of the four officers involved. The documents offer the clearest picture yet of Mr Floyd's last moments. His death in May sparked global uproar. It led to a wave of anti-racism protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement, and stirred debate and reflection in the US over the country's history of slavery and segregation. All four officers involved in taking Mr Floyd into custody were fired and arrested. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck, faces several charges including second-degree murder, while the other three - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting murder. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life What US police officers think of protests What's changed since George Floyd's death? The transcripts were made public on Thursday as Mr Lane's lawyers asked for the case against him to be dismissed. Warning: Some readers may find the content below distressing. Until now, eyewitness footage shared on social media revealed most of what was known about Mr Floyd's arrest and his final moments. The new transcripts give a more detailed account,external, shedding light on significant parts of the encounter, from the time Mr Lane and Mr Kueng arrived at the scene, to the point where Mr Floyd was given CPR in an ambulance. Transcripts of footage recorded by body cameras fitted to Mr Lane and Mr Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers in a Minneapolis street. They confronted him outside a convenience store where he was suspected of having used a forged $20 note to buy cigarettes. At one point, a handcuffed Mr Floyd, while pinned down on the road next to the police car, gasps that he cannot breathe, adding: ""You're going to kill me, man."" This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting Mr Chauvin, who is shown in bystander footage appearing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. ""It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk."" The transcripts show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Mr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. In response to one of the demands to see his hands, Mr Floyd says: ""Man, I got, I got shot the same way, Mr Officer, before."" It is not clear what he is referring to. This video can not be played Why monuments in the US are being taken down At one point Mr Lane says: ""Why's he getting all squirrelly and not showing us his hands and just being all weird like that?"" The officers then handcuff Mr Floyd and try to put him into the back of their police car. As they do, Mr Floyd becomes agitated, repeatedly pleading that he is claustrophobic. Mr Lane asks if he is ""on something"". Mr Floyd replies: ""I'm scared, man."" According to another document, Mr Lane told investigators that once in the car, Mr Floyd began ""thrashing back and forth"". When asked ""So he pushed himself out of the car?"" Mr Lane replied: ""Yeah"". The investigator then asks: ""Versus you guys pulling him out of the car?"" and Mr Lane says: ""Yeah, because the goal is to keep him in the car, we didn't want him coming out again."" Pinned on the ground, according to the transcript, Mr Floyd cries out a dozen times: ""Mama."" What we know about the officers charged over his death He says: ""Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. ""Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead."" Thomas Lane was just days into the job when the incident happened At one point, when Mr Floyd continues to plead he can't breathe, Mr Lane asks Mr Chauvin: ""Should we roll him on his side?"" Mr Chauvin responds: ""No, he's staying put where we got him."" Mr Lane then says: ""Okay. Just worry about the excited delirium or whatever."" Mr Chauvin replies: ""Well that's why we got the ambulance coming,"" and Mr Lane says ""Okay, I suppose"". Mr Chauvin's lawyers have not commented on the documents since they were made public. This video can not be played In June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd's death The transcripts were released in support of a legal bid to dismiss the criminal charges against Mr Lane, a new recruit only days into the job when Mr Floyd's death happened. Mr Lane's lawyer Earl Gray, who filed the documents, argued that it was ""not fair or reasonable"" for his client to stand trial on the charges. The new court documents includea transcript of Mr Lane's interview with investigators,externalfrom Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. In the interview, Mr Lane talked through the first crucial moments of his encounter with Mr Floyd. Mr Lane said he had pulled his gun out and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands after approaching his car and seeing him ""sitting with his hands down below the seat"". Pictures from inside the car Mr Floyd was sitting in before his arrest show two crumpled $20 bills that, according to Mr Gray, were counterfeit. Mr Lane's lawyer said two fake $20 bills were found in the car Mr Floyd was sitting in At the end of the interview, one of the investigators asked Mr Lane if he felt either he or Mr Chauvin had contributed to Mr Floyd's death. ""I object to that. You're not going to answer that,"" Mr Gray said. The incident and the bystander videos that exposed it highlighted deep wounds over racial inequality in the US. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflected years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally. This video can not be played President Trump posed for a photo op outside a church, moments after protesters were cleared by police Police forces, governments and businesses pledged reforms in recognition of the racial inequality that fuelled the protests. Monuments to historical figures with links to slavery in the US and other countries were re-assessed. Some were toppled or vandalised, others were taken down by authorities and institutions. Mr Floyd's death followed the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Why US protests are so powerful this time Five pieces of context to understand protests Tipping point for racially divided nation 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"Leicester's local lockdown is not due to be reviewed until 18 July The first city in the UK to be put in local lockdown will not receive special financial support from the government. Businesses in Leicester had expected extra help after they were ordered to close on 30 June following a spike in Covid-19 cases. But a letter from Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi said there were no plans to change or extend any current schemes. Labour MP Liz Kendall said she was ""so angry"" at the development. Chris Hobson, from East Midlands Chamber of Commerce, said not giving extra help was a ""massive mistake"". The latest weekly figures from Public Health England, released on Thursday, showed 116 new cases per 100,000 people in the city in the week up to 5 July. This is down from 141 per 100,000 the week before, but still far ahead of any other area of England. Businesses in Leicester were ordered to close on 30 June following a spike in Covid-19 cases Shadow social care minister Ms Kendall, whoreleased a letter from Mr Zahawi about the government's stance,external, said it was ""a warning for future local lockdowns"". ""People in Leicester have made huge sacrifices and everybody is hanging on in there,"" she said. ""I think it is wrong the government isn't saying 'you're in lockdown for longer, you'll get the help for longer'.""

Stuart Fraser said the Leicester Outdoor Pursuits Centre had launched an appeal to raise money Stuart Fraser, manager of Leicester Outdoor Pursuits Centre, said the lack of extra funding was ""a blow"" and called for clarity on when the lockdown would be lifted. ""We have already had to cancel the first week of our holiday scheme,"" he said. ""And we have staff putting pressure on, saying they may have to look elsewhere for work, and this is trained staff who, if we lose them, will affect our ability to reopen at all."" Mr Fraser said the centre, a registered charity, had launched a fundraising campaign to ""help it survive"". Leicester Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said he was ""absolutely furious"" the expected funds had not materialised and described the lack of extra measures as ""brutal"". Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Weekly figures released by Public Health England show there were 116 new cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 5 July. This is down from 141 cases per 100,000 people the week before, but still at more than three times more than the next highest in England. The rate of cases in Bradford has fallen faster than Rochdale, which was second highest after Leicester. New cases of coronavirus in Leicester came quickly during June, having previously started falling the month before. So far, 24 June has seen the highest number of positive tests in Leicester of any day since the pandemic started with 97 confirmed results. The data combines tests in hospitals and those done in the community,the latter of which has only recently been added to the local figuresand showed for the first time how Leicester really compares with other areas. As of Wednesday, the city has the highest rate of confirmed coronavirus per head of population in England with 1,136 cases per 100,000 population. The next highest is Bradford with nearly 792 per 100,000. Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC there would be extra financial support for Leicester businesses affected by the local lockdown. ""We have given support to both the county council and the city council to make sure they have discretionary funds available to support businesses, if that's what's needed,"" he said. In his letter, Mr Zahawi claimed the city council had spent less than Â£500,000 of a Â£3.5m discretionary grant awarded to it. He went on to write: ""I hope the lockdown is temporary and that affected businesses in Leicester are able to re-open soon."" But Ms Kendall added: ""I don't think you can tell people one thing one day and tell them something else the other. It is just not right."" A government spokesman said: ""The circumstances of individual lockdowns will continue to be carefully assessed before appropriate action is taken."" On Wednesday it was revealed a county-wide lockdown was considered. County council leader Nick Rushton said that during discussions over where to put the edge of the lockdown zone, ""there was even an argument that the boundary could have included the whole of Leicestershire"" but it would have ""created even more angst"". Newly released data shows,external, since the beginning of the pandemic, Leicester had a positive test rate of 1,116 per 100,000 of population, compared to 294 in nearby Melton, 475 in neighbouring Charnwood and a national average of 440 per 100,000.

New cases of coronavirus in Leicester came quickly during June, having previously started falling the month before. So far, 24 June has seen the highest number of positive tests in Leicester of any day since the pandemic started with 97 confirmed results. The data combines tests in hospitals and those done in the community,the latter of which has only recently been added to the local figuresand showed for the first time how Leicester really compares with other areas. As of Wednesday, the city has the highest rate of confirmed coronavirus per head of population in England with 1,136 cases per 100,000 population. The next highest is Bradford with nearly 792 per 100,000. Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC there would be extra financial support for Leicester businesses affected by the local lockdown. ""We have given support to both the county council and the city council to make sure they have discretionary funds available to support businesses, if that's what's needed,"" he said. In his letter, Mr Zahawi claimed the city council had spent less than Â£500,000 of a Â£3.5m discretionary grant awarded to it. He went on to write: ""I hope the lockdown is temporary and that affected businesses in Leicester are able to re-open soon."" But Ms Kendall added: ""I don't think you can tell people one thing one day and tell them something else the other. It is just not right."" A government spokesman said: ""The circumstances of individual lockdowns will continue to be carefully assessed before appropriate action is taken."" On Wednesday it was revealed a county-wide lockdown was considered. County council leader Nick Rushton said that during discussions over where to put the edge of the lockdown zone, ""there was even an argument that the boundary could have included the whole of Leicestershire"" but it would have ""created even more angst"". Newly released data shows,external, since the beginning of the pandemic, Leicester had a positive test rate of 1,116 per 100,000 of population, compared to 294 in nearby Melton, 475 in neighbouring Charnwood and a national average of 440 per 100,000.

"This video can not be played Sir Mark Sedwill: The decision to stand down was ""amicable"". The UK's top civil servant will receive a payout of almost Â£250,000 when he steps down in September. Sir Mark Sedwill confirmed he was leaving Whitehall last month as Boris Johnson announced plans to split his role as cabinet secretary and national security adviser into two posts. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team in Downing Street. On Wednesday, the PM signed off the Â£248,189 pension contribution. The amount was recommended by Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm, with advice from Civil Service Human Resources and legal advisers, before being agreed by Mr Johnson. In a note from No 10, the PM said the payment was ""likely to be in the form of a pension contribution"" for Sir Mark. What do the UK's 450,000 civil servants actually do? UK's top civil servant announces exit Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Mark told the National Security Strategy Committee he had not ""resigned"" but left his post ""by agreement"" with the PM. ""We had concluded it was time to split the jobs again and have a separate security adviser and separate cabinet secretary,"" he added. Sir Mark said the timing was ""at his initiative"", as it was ""never my intention to do that [job] long-term"", but the departure was ""entirely amicable"". The UK's chief negotiator in post-Brexit trade talks with the EU, David Frost, will take over as national security adviser as a political appointee. The Cabinet Office has published a job advert for the cabinet secretary position, with a salary of Â£200,000, and the role is open to current and former permanent secretaries. The person who gets the position will advise the prime minister on implementing policy and the conduct of government. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the prime minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. Sir Mark is a career diplomat who served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office, before working alongside former Prime Minister Theresa May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice followingSir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Asked about reports of anonymous briefings from Downing Street against him, Sir Mark told the committee that civil servants had become ""fair game"" and it ""goes with the territory"". He added: ""It is never pleasant to find oneself, particularly as an official, in the midst of stories of that kind. ""I don't think it is ever pleasant in government, whether it is against ministers, between them and particularly against officials, when you have briefings to which you cannot really reply, particularly those that are off the record and sniping away. ""But it is a regrettable feature of modern politics, I'm afraid."" After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer and will chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations.

"Taxpayers face a day of reckoning when the government's massive coronavirus support measures have to be paid off, experts warn. The Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank says the economy will remain in a ""support and recovery"" phase for some time, but higher taxes are inevitable. On Wednesday, the chancellor unveiled another Â£30bn of support, bringing the total cost to Â£190bn. But it was revealed the UK's tax authority queried its value for money. The most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about the value of two measures in his summer statement - the Job Retention Bonus and the eating out support. Wednesday's additional spending announced by Mr Sunak is worth nearly Â£3,000 for every person in the UK - and more than the entire planned health budget for 2020-21. It also means that the cost of the crisis so far has risen by more than 40% since last month, when the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,estimated it at Â£133bn,external. Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Rishi Sunak: We can't protect every job Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? On Thursday, in its analysis of the latest measures, the IFS predicted that government borrowing would surge to about Â£350bn this year. In March, the government forecast a deficit of about Â£50bn to Â£60bn this year. The IFS said it expected further spending support in the autumn Budget, perhaps through targeted tax cuts. However, IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Let's hold in the back of our minds that a reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually. ""This is no normal recession. It's the deepest in history,"" Mr Johnson said. The IFS said annual borrowing as a share of the economy was on course to be its highest outside wartime in more than 300 years. Mr Sunak has given few details about how he intends to pay for the huge public spending, but has previously refused to rule out tax rises. There are some things no chancellor can prepare for - such as what to do if your economy wipes out 18 years' gains in two months of lockdown. His solution was to temporarily deep freeze the economy, and pump money into crisis response. And the thawing process needs more funds, to prevent long term damage. Now economists are talking about a deficit, a shortfall of way more than the Â£300bn previously expected. It's equivalent to a bigger slice of the economy than at any time since the Second World War. And it could get bigger; if more is needed to support the recovery - or in the event of a severe second wave. But it's a cost worth bearing if it carries the economy through a devastating crisis, safeguard the damage to output and jobs -  and ensure taxes get paid. For at some point, there will have to be a discussion about how we pay this back. The government is currently borrowing record amounts on the financial markets to plug the gap - but that may not be enough. There may have to be tax hikes, possibly less generous rises in pensions. But it may be a while until the economy is robust enough to bear that. Of the policy measures announced in Wednesday's summer statement, the biggest was the plan to pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. The total bill could rise as high as Â£9.4bn, but only if every furloughed worker keeps their job. But Mr Johnson said there was a ""value for money issue"" about the scheme. ""A lot, probably a majority, of the job retention bonus money will go in respect of jobs that would have been, indeed already have been, returned from furlough anyway,"" he said. And he said much of the planned cuts in VAT and stamp duty ""will be deadweight"". It has also emerged that the UK tax authority had some doubts. Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, wrote to the chancellor earlier this week about the Job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out policies. On both, he said, advice received by HMRC and the Treasury ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the proposals. However, the correspondence showed the chancellor said the plans should go ahead because there was a ""compelling case"". Businessman Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, also questioned if the job retention bonus was money well spent, as he thought some firms would only retain staff until they get the cash. ""Firms will either want their staff back, or they won't. I just feel some employers will take advantage of this scheme,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Meanwhile, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the financial cost of the crisis, at Â£190bn so far, was ""approaching the amount we spend on the day-to-day running of our NHS, schools and colleges each year"". He welcomed the focus on supporting young people and sectors most affected by lockdown, but added: ""The scale of support... risks falling short of what will be required. The chancellor is taking quite a gamble on the strength of the recovery in the months ahead."" JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"Two of the UK's biggest High Street retailers, John Lewis and Boots, have announced 5,300 job cuts. Boots has said 4,000 jobs will go, while John Lewis is shutting down eight stores, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. The moves come amid warnings thatnew economic support from Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill not be enough to stop millions of workers losing their jobs. Mr Sunak admitted thathe would not be able to protect ""every single job""as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". Boots is consulting on plans to cut head office and store teams and shut 48 of its more than 600 Boots Opticians practices. It has not yet said which outlets will close, but about 7% of its workforce will lose their jobs. John Lewis said department stores in Birmingham and Watford will not reopen as the coronavirus lockdown eases. It also plans to shut down its At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth and travel sites at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras. Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' How is furlough changing? Mr Sunak unveiled a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at saving jobs, including a one-off Â£1,000 payment to employers for every furloughed employee retained to the end of January 2021. He also announced measures to benefit the hospitality sector, includinggiving diners 50% off eating out from Monday to Wednesday in August. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves to support restaurants, pubs and cafes could also help retail. ""We very much hope that when people go to their local pub or their restaurant to eat out, those are often in the centre of towns, hopefully that will encourage the footfall to those areas so we get more people going to our shops as well,"" Mr Dowden said, speaking after announcing the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and outdoor theatres. John Lewis says some of its stores were in trouble before the virus struck, while Boots already had plans for a shake-up. The crisis has forced them to speed up efforts to deal with the rise of internet shopping. And just now they face the phasing out of the government-supported furlough scheme, starting next month. One by one, retailers are revealing how many staff they will bring back into stores as the job subsidy is withdrawn. Most Boots outlets remained open throughout the lockdown to provide pharmacy and healthcare services, but the firm said footfall had ""dramatically reduced"". The firm said sales across all Boots UK outlets were down 50% in the third quarter, and some 70% at Boots Opticians. ""Restrictions are beginning to lift, but with an uncertain economic outlook, it is anticipated that the High Street will take considerable time to recover,"" it said. Boots said last year that it was reviewing the size of its UK operationswith the possibility that up to 200 stores could be closed. The managing director of Boots UK, Sebastian James, described the latest cuts as ""decisive actions to accelerate our transformation plan"". John Lewis said the eight stores affected were already ""financially challenged"" even before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 had caused customers to move more quickly towards online shopping and away from stores. John Lewis Partnership chairwoman Sharon White said: ""Closing a shop is always incredibly difficult and today's announcement will come as very sad news to customers and partners. ""However, we believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the partnership - and continue to meet the needs of our customers, however and wherever they want to shop."" Ms White said John Lewis would do everything it could to keep on as many people as possible. John Lewis had warned in March it could close shopsas a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. Former John Lewis boss Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands, said the closure of the chain's flagship Birmingham store was ""deeply disappointing"". ""At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one which I believe risks being a dreadful mistake,""he tweeted,external. He added that his belief in its potential was ""unwavering"" and that he would be making the case for it to stay open. The planned closure of John Lewis's Watford store has prompteda petition to save it,external, which has been signed by 4,400 people so far. Other John Lewis customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""With no modification to the jobs retention scheme, that dreaded October cliff-edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. ""Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace."" Vivienne King, chief executive at Revo, which represents the retail property sector, warned that three million retail jobs remained in jeopardy unless the government undertook ""a fundamental review of business rates and direct financial support to underwrite rents"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak himself told BBC Breakfast: ""Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs? Yes, and the scale of this is significant. ""We are entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen. That is of course going to have a significant impact on unemployment and on job losses."" Lucy Powell, shadow minister for business and consumers, said the job cuts were ""deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots"" and described Mr Sunak's statement as ""a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it"".

"The Welsh Government said the Â£29m would target disadvantaged pupils and those studying for exams Nine-hundred extra teaching posts are to be created as part of a Â£29m support package to help pupils catch up when they return to school. The Welsh Government said it would pay for the equivalent of 600 teachers and 300 teaching assistants for a year. It will target disadvantaged pupils and those taking exams, and could include extra coaching and learning resources. Head teachers' union NAHT welcomed the announcement, saying it was vital to invest in the next generation. Education Minister Kirsty Williams will later reveal whether pupils will return to full-time education in September. The Welsh Government said newly qualified teachers and supply teachers would take up the majority of the posts, and will be on one-year contracts. Thousands want September full-time school return School reopening plans needed, union says What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales? In secondary schools, support will be focused on pupils studying for exams in Years 11, 12 and 13, as well as pupils of all ages who receive free schools meals, have additional learning needs or who are identified as being vulnerable. Learning resources are promised to help new and current teachers deliver support to pupils studying for exams, which could include personalised learning programmes and additional lessons. A range of teaching approaches will be used, the government said, including ""blended learning"" - a mix of learning from home and limited face-to-face teaching. Schools reopened in a limited capacity on 29 June Details are to follow about how the money will be shared between schools, it added. Ms Williams said the government was supporting schools in the ""recovery phase"" and would continue to raise standards. ""This extra investment and targeted support will ensure that the impact of time away from school over recent months is minimised,"" she said. ""This is not a short-term fix. I am guaranteeing this money, extra staff and support for the whole of next year."" The announcement comes as Ms Williams is due to set out plans for how schools will operate in the new term. Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she wants to ""maximise"" face-to-face contact between pupils and teachers She told a Senedd committee on Tuesday that her goal was to ""maximise"" face-to-face contact between pupils and teachers. It suggests the minister could adopt similar plans to those proposed in other parts of the UK planning for the full-time return of pupils after the summer.

"Energy companies have criticised proposals by the industry's regulator to cut customers' bills and spend more on green investments. Under Ofgem's plans, households could see their bills cut by Â£20 a year while firms spend Â£25bn over five years to invest in the UK's energy network. Ofgem said it wanted ""a greener, fairer energy system for consumers"". However, National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power all said that the regulator's plans were flawed. The energy regulator sets out price controls which dictate how much money gas and electricity companies can earn, while allowing them sufficient scope to fund new investment from customers' bills. Under its latest proposals, which run from 2021 to 2026, they will be allowed to spend Â£25bn on improving gas and electricity networks and recoup this cost from customers. Some Â£3bn will be used to make the electricity network more environmentally friendly, while more than Â£1bn will go towards green energy research and reducing the networks' own impact on the environment. In order to reduce the cost to consumers, Ofgem says, the return energy firms will be allowed to make from their investments will be nearly halved. The regulator said this would mean that ""less of consumers' money goes towards network companies' profits, and more towards driving network improvements"". Ofgem estimated that cutting returns would save more than Â£3.3bn over the next five years, which should cut household bills by about Â£20 a year. The regulator added that investing in the energy network of the UK was low-risk and should be an attractive option to investors. ""Strong evidence from water regulation and Ofgem's offshore transmission regime shows that investors will accept lower returns and continue to invest robustly in the sector,"" it said. Ofgem also said it would provide firms with additional funding for green projects from its own coffers, with Â£10bn worth of such schemes already under consideration. Citizens Advice said the move could put an end to energy firms ""overcharging energy customers by billions of pounds"". ""Ofgem has struck the right balance between shareholder returns and value for money for energy customers, while making sure networks can continue to attract investment,"" said Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. Uswitch.com., the comparison website, also welcomed the move. ""The amount of profit that network companies have been allowed to make in recent years has been a matter of significant controversy, given our energy suppliers have to pass on these charges to our bills."" Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again However, National Grid said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the plans. ""This proposal leaves us concerned as to our ability to deliver resilient and reliable networks, and jeopardises the delivery of the energy transition and the green recovery."" Energy firm SSE said the proposal was likely to be challenged through the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). ""Ofgem's first pass at a settlement resembles a worrying return to austerity,"" Rob McDonald, the managing director of transmission at SSE, said. ""At present the draft settlement does not strike the right balance for all stakeholders and without significant changes during the consultation period, there is a real risk that the critical investment in Britain's electricity networks will be unnecessarily slowed down by an appeal process via the CMA, which is not in any stakeholders' interests."" Scottish Power called Ofgem's plans ""a massive missed opportunity"". ""Instead of investing more in creating green jobs and skilled apprenticeships in every community, at a time when the UK needs them most, this is a short-sighted return to austerity politics. ""Nobody benefits from this half-baked plan. It's bad for jobs, bad for apprenticeships, bad for training and bad for the UK supply chain. ""Net Zero can be an accelerator of the economic recovery, but only if private companies are given the right conditions for investment. Slamming the door in investors' faces by offering one of the lowest rates of return of any developed country traps the UK in an economic cul-de-sac.""

Nuffield Southampton Theatres (NST) closed permanently with the loss of 86 jobs after shutting amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its landlord, Southampton City Council, insisted the Studio 144 building could still have a ""bright future"". Arts Council England said NST was experiencing financial problems beforethe lockdown began. Fears of cuts to Eurostar jobs and services have led union leaders to urge the government to offer it support. The cross-Channel rail company said it was planning to reduce payroll costs in order to protect its long-term future amid the impact of Covid-19. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) unioncalled on the Transport Secretary to intervene as a matter of urgency. Two pubs in West Yorkshire have closed after customers tested positive for coronavirus. The Angel (pictured) and Boot and Shoe, both in Ackworth, near Wakefield, saidthey were closed for deep cleaning but planned to reopen on Friday. In separate posts on Facebook, both pubs said they had been contacted by a customer who said they had tested positive. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The latest weekly report from Public Health Englandshows the rate of new coronavirus cases in Leicester was 116 per 100,000 in the week to 5 July, down from 141 per 100,000 the week before. Rochdale is now a distant second in England as Bradford's rate of new cases has fallen faster, putting it in third place. The figures now include both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 tests. Pillar 1 tests are those done in hospitals or involving healthcare workers and until last week were the only ones where the data was broken down locally. Pillar 2 tests are those done in the community and it was these that surged in Leicester during June, leading to the local lockdown. Alex PopeBBC News Online A ""dream team"" of volunteers are today sorting out 1,500 packs of arts materials for underprivileged children. Bedford Creative Arts (BCA) said the packs were going to homes across the county. The Let's Create scheme, funded by Arts Council England, is for families who would not usually have art resources at home and includes worksheets from local artists. Kayte Judge, from BCA, said: ""With many children at home for extended periods we know that art resources will help families provide positive activities as we move into the summer, so we had to make this happen here and we are pleased to have had the partnerships in place to have let us do so."" Sixteen volunteers were working hard sorting out three pallets of materials at Elstow Abbey, the charity said. Life in the UK has been transformed since restrictions were brought in to curb the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions, which have affected all aspects of society, were relaxed further in most of England from Saturday, with pubs allowed to reopen and people allowed to meet indoors, while in Scotland the five-mile travel limit was also lifted on Friday. But how has life changed over the past three months? One of the longest-running Christmas markets in the UK has been cancelled over concerns about social distancing. Lincoln's Christmas market started in 1982 as part of its twinning with the town of Neustadt. The market attracts about 250,000 people over four days in December. Simon Colburn, Lincoln Council's assistant director for health,said keeping people apart would be ""impossible"". Two reports charting coronavirus cases in Englandshow the number of people in the community with the disease is falling. The Office for National Statistics report estimates one in 3,900 people have Covid-19 - 0.03% of the population, down from one in 2,200 the previous week. And data from Public Health England show confirmed cases fell by 25% in the week to 5 July. In Leicester, they fell to 120 per 100,000 from 140 per 100,000 last week. A man has been arrested on suspicion of defrauding the government's furlough scheme out of Â£495,000. The arrest, thought to be the first relating to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme,was carried out in Solihull in the West Midlands. Computers were seized and funds frozen in the 57-year-old man's business bank account, HM Revenue and Customs said. Amy OrtonLocal Democracy Reporter Plans to impose a lockdown on the whole of Leicestershire were discussed, the county council leader has said. The city of Leicester and some surrounding areaswent into local lockdown last week after a spike in coronavirus infections. But Leicestershire County
Council leader Nick Rushton said at one point the measures - which will last until 18 July at the earliest - could have affected the
whole county. He said: ""I recognise that a lot of people are unhappy that in their view they've been lumped in with Leicester but it's not so much lumping in. The virus doesn't know boundaries.

"A Â£15bn bill for PPE has helped to push the cost of the coronavirus outbreak to Â£190bn Public spending on the battle against coronavirus has risen to nearly Â£190bn, according to latest Treasury figures. It comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunakannounced another Â£30bn of supportin his summer statement on Wednesday. The extra money is worth nearly Â£3,000 for every person in the UK - and more than the entire planned health budget for 2020-21. But despite the soaring cost of supporting the economy,some sectors said they had been ""ignored"". Although Mr Sunak said his priority was getting people back to work, he acknowledged that the extra support would not be enough to save every job and prevent further economic hardship. Direct spending on the crisis, excluding the latest Â£30bn package, has risen to Â£158.7bn, Mr Sunak revealed on Wednesday. Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Rishi Sunak: We can't protect every job Â£1,000 bonus 'may not be enough to protect jobs' Including the new measures, it means the cost of the crisis has risen by more than 40% since last month, when the government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility,estimated it at Â£133bn,external. This extra spending is likely to push the gap between what the government spends and what it raises in taxes - the deficit - above the OBR's latest estimate of around Â£300bn, according to the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank. Before the coronavirus outbreak began, the government was expecting a deficit of Â£55bn. The extra public spending figure includes Â£15bn to buy personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. It also includes Â£10bn for the testing and tracing of infected persons, taking the total extra spending on health services to Â£32bn. ""There is a huge public services additional spending that we didn't really know about that was announced (on Wednesday). It was kind of skated over, but Â£15bn for PPE for frontline workers is an enormous sum,"" Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC. He said the chancellor's strategy was to spend money now, to minimise long-term damage to the economy, which would ultimately cause more harm overall. ""I don't think the chancellor is desperately worried about the size of the deficit this year. What will concern him is the size of the deficit the year after, and the year after, and the year after that,"" he said. Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the financial cost of the crisis, at Â£190bn so far, was ""approaching the amount we spend on the day-to-day running of our NHS, schools and colleges each year"". He welcomed the focus on supporting young people and sectors most affected by lockdown, but added: ""The scale of support... risks falling short of what will be required. The chancellor is taking quite a gamble on the strength of the recovery in the months ahead."" There are some things no chancellor can prepare for - such as what to do if your economy wipes out 18 years' gains in two months of lockdown. His solution was to temporarily deep freeze the economy, and pump money into crisis response. And the thawing process needs more funds, to prevent long term damage. Now economists are talking about a deficit, a shortfall of way more than the Â£300bn previously expected. It's equivalent to a bigger slice of the economy than at any time since the Second World War. And it could get bigger; if more is needed to support the recovery - or in the event of a severe second wave. But it's a cost worth bearing if it carries the economy through a devastating crisis, safeguard the damage to output and jobs -  and ensure taxes get paid. For at some point, there will have to be a discussion about how we pay this back. The government is currently borrowing record amounts on the financial markets to plug the gap - but that may not be enough. There may have to be tax hikes, possibly less generous rises in pensions. But it may be a while until the economy is robust enough to bear that. Concern that the chancellor did not go far enough was underlined by the aviation industry. The Airlines UK trade body criticised the decision not to extend the furlough scheme beyond October, saying flights were likely to continue to be restricted during the winter. It would mean more jobs lost in addition to the tens of thousands of redundancies already announced ""if the government continues to ignore aviation"", a spokesman for the trade body said. Of the policy measures announced in Wednesday's summer statement, the biggest was the plan to pay employers Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker they retain past January. The total bill could rise as high as Â£9.4bn, but only if every furloughed worker keeps their job. But Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, wondered if it was money well spent, as he thought some firms would only retain staff until they get the cash. ""Firms will either want their staff back, or they won't. I just feel some employers will take advantage of this scheme,"" he told the BBC.

"The chancellor has said he is ""sorry"" for not helping ""everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted"". Rishi Sunak said the government was ""throwing everything"" at stemming job losses with a Â£30bn stimulus package. But he told the BBC he will not be able to protect ""every single job"" as the UK enters a ""severe recession"". He also admitted that some of the Â£1,000 bonuses being offered to take back furloughed staff would go to firms that were already keeping workers on. Labour has called for a more targeted approach to saving jobs, saying the government will ""waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support"". Anger as locked-down Leicester denied extra cash Taxes will rise to pay for virus, says think tank Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance In his summer statement on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the ""jobs retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9bn if every worker currently furloughed is kept on. Meanwhile, it has emerged the most senior civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs did not back two of the key policies in Mr Sunak's summer statement over uncertainty about their value for money. In letters to the chancellor, Jim Harra, HMRC's permanent secretary, said advice received by HMRC ""highlights uncertainty around the value for money"" of the job Retention Bonus and Eat Out To Help Out scheme - which gives diners money off some meals in August. Self-employed curtain fitter Mark Whittaker told BBC Breakfast he cannot ""get his head round how the chancellor expects any citizen of this country to get by on zero income"". ""If he can manage it, please tell me how to do it,"" Mr Whittaker said. ""I don't want a handoutâ¦ I want parity."" This video can not be played âI donât want a handoutâ¦ I want parity and thatâs it.â Mr Whittaker started his own business in Stockport, Greater Manchester, towards the end of 2018 and fell short of earnings requirements to receive support during the crisis. He said people in his situation have children, mortgages, rent and bills to pay. Responding to Mr Whittaker's comments, Mr Sunak said more than 2.5 million people who are self-employed will receive support from a ""generous"" scheme of government funding. He added: ""Have we been able to help everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted? I'm sure not and I've said previously that we haven't been able to do that and for that I am sorry."" Mr Sunak warned the UK was ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"". ""If you're asking me 'can I protect every single job' of course the answer is no,"" he said. ""'Is unemployment going to rise, are people going to lose their jobs?' Yes, and the scale of this is significant."" It comes as figures released by the Treasury reveal that public spending on the battle against coronavirushas risen to nearly Â£190bn. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the UK was not in a ""normal recession"" but ""the deepest in history"". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)estimates that unemployment in the UK will reach ""record highs"",externalof up to 11.7% by the end of 2020, without a second wave of coronavirus. With a second wave, it says UK unemployment could reach near 15%. The chancellor announced a series of measures to help the economy on Wednesday, including a VAT cut for the hospitality and tourism sectors, a bonus scheme for employers and an eating out money off scheme for August. Mr Sunak said the Â£1,000 bonus being offered to businesses that keep furloughed staff in jobs until January would be a ""dead weight"" cost, as some employers who intend to retain workers anyway would benefit. The Chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Throughout this crisis I've had decisions to make and whether to act in a broad way at scale and at speed or to act in a more targeted and nuanced way. ""In an ideal world, you're absolutely right, you would minimise that dead weight and do everything in incredibly targeted fashion. ""The problem is the severity of what was happening to our economy, the scale of what was happening, and indeed the speed that it was happening at demanded a different response."" He said that ""without question there will be dead weight - and there has been dead weight in all of the interventions we have put in place"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Philipson said: ""The chancellor should be targeting support on those who need it, not handing it out aimlessly to those who don't. ""It's not brave to admit the government plans to waste billions at a time when others are crying out for support."" Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October.

"Energy companies have criticised proposals by the industry's regulator to cut customers' bills and spend more on green investments. Under Ofgem's plans, households could see their bills cut by Â£20 a year while firms spend Â£25bn over five years to invest in the UK's energy network. Ofgem said it wanted ""a greener, fairer energy system for consumers"". However, National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power all said that the regulator's plans were flawed. The energy regulator sets out price controls which dictate how much money gas and electricity companies can earn, while allowing them sufficient scope to fund new investment from customers' bills. Under its latest proposals, which run from 2021 to 2026, they will be allowed to spend Â£25bn on improving gas and electricity networks and recoup this cost from customers. Some Â£3bn will be used to make the electricity network more environmentally friendly, while more than Â£1bn will go towards green energy research and reducing the networks' own impact on the environment. In order to reduce the cost to consumers, Ofgem says, the return energy firms will be allowed to make from their investments will be nearly halved. The regulator said this would mean that ""less of consumers' money goes towards network companies' profits, and more towards driving network improvements"". Ofgem estimated that cutting returns would save more than Â£3.3bn over the next five years, which should cut household bills by about Â£20 a year. The regulator added that investing in the energy network of the UK was low-risk and should be an attractive option to investors. ""Strong evidence from water regulation and Ofgem's offshore transmission regime shows that investors will accept lower returns and continue to invest robustly in the sector,"" it said. Ofgem also said it would provide firms with additional funding for green projects from its own coffers, with Â£10bn worth of such schemes already under consideration. Citizens Advice said the move could put an end to energy firms ""overcharging energy customers by billions of pounds"". ""Ofgem has struck the right balance between shareholder returns and value for money for energy customers, while making sure networks can continue to attract investment,"" said Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. Uswitch.com., the comparison website, also welcomed the move. ""The amount of profit that network companies have been allowed to make in recent years has been a matter of significant controversy, given our energy suppliers have to pass on these charges to our bills."" Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again However, National Grid said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the plans. ""This proposal leaves us concerned as to our ability to deliver resilient and reliable networks, and jeopardises the delivery of the energy transition and the green recovery."" Energy firm SSE said the proposal was likely to be challenged through the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). ""Ofgem's first pass at a settlement resembles a worrying return to austerity,"" Rob McDonald, the managing director of transmission at SSE, said. ""At present the draft settlement does not strike the right balance for all stakeholders and without significant changes during the consultation period, there is a real risk that the critical investment in Britain's electricity networks will be unnecessarily slowed down by an appeal process via the CMA, which is not in any stakeholders' interests."" Scottish Power called Ofgem's plans ""a massive missed opportunity"". ""Instead of investing more in creating green jobs and skilled apprenticeships in every community, at a time when the UK needs them most, this is a short-sighted return to austerity politics. ""Nobody benefits from this half-baked plan. It's bad for jobs, bad for apprenticeships, bad for training and bad for the UK supply chain. ""Net Zero can be an accelerator of the economic recovery, but only if private companies are given the right conditions for investment. Slamming the door in investors' faces by offering one of the lowest rates of return of any developed country traps the UK in an economic cul-de-sac.""

"This video can not be played Sir Mark Sedwill: The decision to stand down was ""amicable"". The UK's top civil servant will receive a payout of almost Â£250,000 when he steps down in September. Sir Mark Sedwill confirmed he was leaving Whitehall last month as Boris Johnson announced plans to split his role as cabinet secretary and national security adviser into two posts. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team in Downing Street. On Wednesday, the PM signed off the Â£248,189 pension contribution. The amount was recommended by Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm, with advice from Civil Service Human Resources and legal advisers, before being agreed by Mr Johnson. In a note from No 10, the PM said the payment was ""likely to be in the form of a pension contribution"" for Sir Mark. What do the UK's 450,000 civil servants actually do? UK's top civil servant announces exit Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Mark told the National Security Strategy Committee he had not ""resigned"" but left his post ""by agreement"" with the PM. ""We had concluded it was time to split the jobs again and have a separate security adviser and separate cabinet secretary,"" he added. Sir Mark said the timing was ""at his initiative"", as it was ""never my intention to do that [job] long-term"", but the departure was ""entirely amicable"". The UK's chief negotiator in post-Brexit trade talks with the EU, David Frost, will take over as national security adviser as a political appointee. The Cabinet Office has published a job advert for the cabinet secretary position, with a salary of Â£200,000, and the role is open to current and former permanent secretaries. The person who gets the position will advise the prime minister on implementing policy and the conduct of government. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the prime minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. Sir Mark is a career diplomat who served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office, before working alongside former Prime Minister Theresa May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice followingSir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Asked about reports of anonymous briefings from Downing Street against him, Sir Mark told the committee that civil servants had become ""fair game"" and it ""goes with the territory"". He added: ""It is never pleasant to find oneself, particularly as an official, in the midst of stories of that kind. ""I don't think it is ever pleasant in government, whether it is against ministers, between them and particularly against officials, when you have briefings to which you cannot really reply, particularly those that are off the record and sniping away. ""But it is a regrettable feature of modern politics, I'm afraid."" After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer and will chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations.

Here are the main stories: This video can not be played How stand-up comedians went online to survive lockdown With many theatres and live entertainment venues in the UK still closed because of coronavirus, comedians, performers and entertainers have taken to online platforms. In the video above, comedians tell the BBC how they're adjusting to this ""new normal"".

Chris EwokorBBC News, Abuja The lawsuit accuses China of failing to promptly inform the WHO about the virus An attempt by Nigerian lawyers to get compensation from China for the coronavirus pandemic has been described by Chinese authorities as ""frivolous."" The group of 11 lawyers is demanding $200bn (Â£158bn) in damages for the ""loss of lives, economic strangulation, trauma, hardship, social disorientation, mental torture and disruption of normal daily existence of people in Nigeria"". But the Chinese embassy in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, said the case lacked basis in international law. China has sent medical teams to Nigeria to assist with relief efforts ""Covid-19 has caught the whole world by surprise. China, like other countries, is a victim. Confronted by an unknown virus, we have acted responsibly to protect people's life and health and safeguard global public health,""it said in statement on Twitter,external. The lawyers are trying to persuade Nigeria's government to institute state action against China through the International Court of Justice. Their case is yet to be heard at Nigeria's High Court.

A 23-year-old man has been executed in China for killing two government workers at a health checkpoint in February. Ma Jianguo stabbed the pair to death at a village in Yunan province in February, after he tried to remove a roadblock set up by local authorities. In a statement, the Supreme People's Court of China said he had recently finished a five-year prison sentence for assault. It's the first confirmed death penalty in China related to the country's efforts to contain coronavirus. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg In an apocalyptic warning, a South African health official suggested that half a million graves were being dug in the province of Gauteng to help cemeteries cope with the wave of coronavirus deaths. Dr Bandile Masuku, head of the province's health authorities, made the announcement during a television interview, but his office quickly explained that the actual number was far smaller. So why mention that figure at all? The general assumption is that he was deliberately seeking to spread alarm in a country where the virus has been slow to spread, and where the public has, as a result, begun to drop its guard. In recent days, the infection rate around Johannesburg has been rising sharply, and hospitals here, and in other big municipalities, are already struggling - with reports of oxygen shortages, a lack of beds, and personal protective equipment. South Africa has had months to prepare for this storm. Those preparations are now being tested, and in some places, are being ruthlessly exposed. Sophie LongBBC News, Arizona Protesters marched against coronavirus restrictions in Phoenix on 4 July At a small vigil outside the state
capital in Phoenix, Kristin Urquiza arranges flowers around a picture of her
father Mark. He died last week after contracting coronavirus. Like so many
others, he died alone without his wife or daughter by his side. Kristin tells
me her grief is mixed with rage. She blames the Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey
for her dadâs death. Not only did he lift the lockdown too quickly, she says, but he
made people feel it was safe to go out. Others think individuals should
take responsibility. When the bars and clubs reopened here people partied
pre-pandemic style. Jimmy Flores was one of them - he says he thought he was an
invincible fit and healthy 30-year-old. That was before he spent eight days in
hospital on oxygen after contracting coronavirus at a party. During a brief break from an
overflowing ER, Dr Murtaza Akkter tells me how frustrating it was to watch
young people laughing, drinking and hugging outside bars as he drove home after
a busy shift. The bars and clubs are now closed again. The cases of coronavirus
are still climbing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged countries not to turn to fossil fuels while rebuilding their economies after the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking at a virtual summit for clean energy today, Guterres said some countries were using their economic recovery packages to support fossil fuel companies that were already struggling financially. Others are jump-starting coal-fired power plants, including developing countries who argue that coal is necessary for growth. ""Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans,"" Guterres said. The EU and South Korea have already pledged to make their recovery programmes environmentally-friendly.

Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Slovakia's prime minister Igor Matovic has said his
country might have to reintroduce restrictions, after the country recorded the
single biggest daily increase in Covid-19 infections since 22 April. Matovic said epidemiologists would meet on Monday to discuss the matter. The number of new infections recorded on Wednesday was
53, bringing the total to 1,851. Some 1,477 people have recovered from the
virus, and 28 have died. Slovakia has so far been credited with some of the lowest
infection rates in Europe, as well as what were some of the strictest measures. BBC Radio 5 Live Helen Wong, owner of the
Sweet Mandarin restaurant in Manchester,  tells BBC Radio 5 Live that Rishi Sunak's support is ""highly welcome"". On the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, she says: ""Itâs going to change the
mindset. ""Itâs going to incentivise people to come out and break that
psychological fear of actually meeting people.â Helen has brought in booths and reduced the number of tables in her restaurant from 30 to 10 but says there are still other issues. ""Weâre literally masked up, visored up, we donât want to look
like a hospital but still we need to keep the team safe,"" she says. ""Itâs getting that
balance of enjoying your experience out and dining out but also keeping safety
at the forefront.â The secret to success, she adds, is adapting: ""If youâre not going
to adapt, youâre not going to survive, no matter what size you are.â Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The âun-lockdownâ goes on in England. And, yes, it will be
welcome news for those who run, as well as use places like gyms, swimming
pools and beauticians. But, as ever, the new normal means new complications.
Businesses obviously want to get customers through the door but government
guidance talks about limiting the numbers and spacing out equipment. Gym users
will be expected to play their part too, cleaning machines after use. Many, of
course, will be more than happy to do so. And for those who breach the rules, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden suggested officials would uphold the relevant
standards. But in truth can every leisure space in England really be policed? Common sense will prevail say ministers, with the majority ready to do
what is asked. Meanwhile, business owners will be examining the
guidance closely, hoping that the new normal will allow their firms to be
viable. Oxford University says it will run an in-house Covid-19 testing
service for students and staff from September. The university said its testing system - based at sites in the city centre and Headington - would ""protect our
local community"" and ease the burden on local NHS facilities. It also says research and teaching spaces will be ""adapted
to ensure social distancing and appropriate ventilation"" for the start of term. Libraries will operate social distancing, with a seat-finder app
planned to help students. Face coverings will be required during face-to-face teaching and
in indoor shared spaces - and cleaning will be ""significantly
enhanced"", it added. BBC OS The city of Bergamo in
northern Italy was one of the worst-hit areas by Covid-19 in the country. But now, after 137 days,
the intensive care unit in the city's main hospital, Papa Giovanni XXIII, has
no positive Covid-19 cases. Dr Luca Lorini is the
head of the intensive care unit and emergency department at the hospital. He's been speaking toBBC OS on
World Service radio. ""When we started,
in the first week, we didn't expect so many patients. But it was clear at the
end of the first week that a lot of patients in the region were infected with
Covid-19. ""We worked so hard
in March, April and May. We used more than 100% of our capability,
starting early in the morning trying to find materials, beds, ventilators. It
was three months of very hard work. ""But at the end of
April I observed a downward curve, so we have been expecting this."" Dr Lorini says that the
ICU now has just 72 patients, none of them Covid-positive, and looks like it
did before the coronavirus pandemic. ""It's incredible
because you don't have to use so much protection. So you feel free. You can
drink coffee... the atmosphere is much more comfortable."" However, he says they
still need to be alert for a possible second wave. ""We have to prepare
for the future, because we don't know what will happen. No science, no doctor,
nobody knows."" The Minack Theatre in Cornwall was cited as one venue that can reopen If you're just joining us, here's a reminder about open-air gigs, festivals and theatre shows in England. They can resume from this weekend, as long as they have ""a limited and socially distanced audience"", the government says. Outdoor performances can go ahead from Saturday 11 July.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We cannot lose this generation"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to cut VAT on hospitality as part of a Â£30bn plan to prevent mass unemployment as the economy is hit by coronavirus. The government will also pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. And Mr Sunak announced a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out in August. The chancellor warned ""hardship lies ahead"", but vowed no-one will be left ""without hope"", in a statement to MPs. He told MPs he will cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. It came as the latest death toll for coronavirus, in all settings,increased by 126 to 44,517.,external Chancellor unveils coronavirus recovery plan Chancellor gives diners 50% off on eating out Summer Statement: Key points at a glance Labour said the chancellor's plans did not go far enough and the job retention money should be better targeted to prevent it going to firms that were already planning to bring staff back. ""We were promised a 'New Deal', but what we got was a 'Meal Deal',"" the party added. Mr Sunak rejected calls to extend the furlough scheme beyond October, saying it would give people ""false hope"" that they will have a job to return to, and ""the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade"". Sunak says economic measures 'vital' for Scotland 'Â£500m extra for Wales' from chancellor statement Hospitality and tourism measures welcomed in NI He conceded that jobs would be lost but said he would ""never accept unemployment as an inevitable outcome"" of the pandemic. Details of how the package will be paid for - through borrowing and possible tax rises - are likely to be unveiled in the chancellor's Autumn Budget. ""Over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing,"" he told MPs, adding that the jobs plan was merely the next stage ""in our fight to recover and rebuild after coronavirus"". The ""job retention bonus"" could cost as much as Â£9.4bn if every furloughed worker is brought back. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak chats to customers and serves a few meals to highlight his VAT rate cut to help the hospitality trade Explaining how it will work, the chancellor said: ""If you're an employer and you bring back someone who was furloughed - and continuously employ them through to January - we'll pay you a Â£1,000 bonus per employee. ""It's vital people aren't just returning for the sake of it - they need to be doing decent work. ""So for businesses to get the bonus, the employee must be paid at least Â£520 on average, in each month from November to the end of January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance."" What is VAT and how is it changing? The VAT cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, cafes and pubs, accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites, and attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos. Rishi Sunak said this ""Â£4bn catalyst"" would help protect ""over 2.4 million jobs"". The Treasury said it hoped firms would pass the VAT savings on to customers but many had been without income for months so it would be their decision. The VAT cut is aimed at boosting theme parks and other attractions Mr Sunak also announced an ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount, which he said would help protect 1.8 million jobs, at  a cost of Â£0.5bn. Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off in August, up to a maximum discount of Â£10 per head for everyone, including children. Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a website, which will open next Monday. Luke Johnson, former chairman of the Pizza Express, among other restaurant businesses, told BBC Radio 4's PM the chancellor understood the challenges facing the hospitality sector. Asked if the voucher scheme would work, he said: ""I think a lot of people are still frightened and so every inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their habits of eating and spending and working is good news."" The chancellor also announced a Â£2.1bn ""kickstart scheme"" to create more jobs for young people. The fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. A temporary stamp duty holiday, costing Â£3.8bn, to stimulate the property market was another measure unveiled by the chancellor. This will exempt the first Â£500,000 of all property sales from the tax, from midnight. A few other pledges released in the build-up to his statement included: Vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements as part of a widerÂ£3bn plan to cut emissions A pledge to provide30,000 new traineeships for young people in England AÂ£1.6bn packagefor the arts and heritage sector The doubling of front line staff at job centres, as well as an extra Â£32m for recruiting extra careers advisers and Â£17m for work academies in England Labour's shadow chancellor Annaliese Dodds told the BBC she was ""concerned"" the UK looks ""set to be breaking the previous unfortunate record of three million people unemployed"". She said job support should be better targeted to help struggling sectors. Some 9.3 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month - under the furlough scheme, which was originally due to end in July, before being extended to October, with employer contributions. From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: ""The job retention bonus will help firms protect jobs, but with nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed."" Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the newly self-employed and company directors had ""once again been overlooked"". The National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned that the chancellor's ""badly timed"" measures ""could trigger a rapid rise in unemployment"". The think tank said he was ending the furlough scheme too early and the bonuses for employers to bring staff back ""look too small to be effective"". The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for, for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease.

"Diners will get a 50% discount off their restaurant bill during August under government plans to bolster the embattled hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the ""eat out to help out"" discount as part of a series of measures to restart the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The deal means people can get up to Â£10 off per head if they eat out from Monday to Wednesday. Mr Sunak also said VAT on hospitality and tourism would drop to 5%. The reduction, from 20%, will be in place for the next six months. As he announced the discount, the chancellor said the UK was facing a ""unique moment"" because of Covid-19, adding: ""We need to be creative."" What the summer economic plan means for your money Pubs and restaurants reopened on Saturday after more than three months in lockdown, withsafety measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Mr Sunak sought to reassure the public that it was safe to dine out. ""I know people are cautious about going out. But we wouldn't have lifted the restrictions if we didn't think we could do so, safely,"" he said. The discount will not apply to alcohol, but to food and soft drinks up to Â£10 per person. The Treasury said the 50% discount can be used unlimited times during August and applies to participating restaurants, cafÃ©s, and pubs across the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sunak said the plan was aimed at getting ""customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs"" and protecting ""the 1.8 million people who work in them"". However, the scheme prompted criticism from some who questioned subsidising meals out while British people continue to die from the coronavirus and many people are struggling financially. Businesses that want to take part in the scheme will have to register through a website that opens on Monday 13 July. Mr Sunak said: ""Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days."" He added that the cut in VAT, from 20% to 5%, would apply to ""eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs; accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites [and] attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos"". The lower tax rate will be implemented next Wednesday, 15 July, and will remain in place until 12 January 2021. Caroline Roylance, owner of The George pub at Fordingbridge, Hampshire, said she would be applying for the ""eat out to help out"" scheme. The pub reopened on Wednesday after being closed since 23 March, when the coronavirus lockdown was implemented. Pub-owner Caroline Roylance said the measures will help her business ""through the next few months"" She said the discount and the VAT cut ""will help us make it through the next few months, because trade is unlikely to return to pre-Covid levels for some time"". ""Saying that, it's been surprisingly busy today, which is encouraging, but it's still not July busy,"" said Mrs Roylance. ""It's a start though."" UK Hospitality, the trade body which represents the industry, ""warmly"" welcomed the moves, as well as Mr Sunak's plans to stem unemployment through schemes such ascreating thousands of job placements for young people. However, UK Hospitality's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""This doesn't mean we are out of the woods and there are still significant challenges ahead. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK is facing a ""unique moment"" ""The biggest of these is the spectre of rent liabilities, which many businesses are still facing from their closure period. We are going to need government support on this before too long."" Meanwhile, the exclusion of alcohol from the ""eat out to help out"" discount hit some pub groups' share prices. Mitchells & Butler's share price jumped by 7.3% to 175p towards the end of Mr Sunak's statement, when he revealed the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure industries, as well as the dining out discount. But once it became clear it did not include alcohol, Mitchell & Butler's share price fell ""just as quickly as it spiked up"", said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Marston's share price also dropped 6.1% to 48.98p. JD Wetherspoon's share price fell 2% to 986p.

"George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The US police officer accused of George Floyd's murder told him to stop talking as he repeatedly gasped under the man's knee, according to court documents. The unarmed black man cried out for his late mother and children as he said the Minneapolis policeman would kill him, transcripts from body-cam footage show. They were disclosed in court by lawyers for one of the four officers involved. The documents offer the clearest picture yet of Mr Floyd's last moments. His death in May sparked global uproar. It led to a wave of anti-racism protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement, and stirred debate and reflection in the US over the country's history of slavery and segregation. All four officers involved in taking Mr Floyd into custody were fired and arrested. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck, faces several charges including second-degree murder, while the other three - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting murder. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life What US police officers think of protests What's changed since George Floyd's death? The transcripts were made public on Thursday as Mr Lane's lawyers asked for the case against him to be dismissed. Warning: Some readers may find the content below distressing. Until now, eyewitness footage shared on social media revealed most of what was known about Mr Floyd's arrest and his final moments. The new transcripts give a more detailed account,external, shedding light on significant parts of the encounter, from the time Mr Lane and Mr Kueng arrived at the scene, to the point where Mr Floyd was given CPR in an ambulance. Transcripts of footage recorded by body cameras fitted to Mr Lane and Mr Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers in a Minneapolis street. They confronted him outside a convenience store where he was suspected of having used a forged $20 note to buy cigarettes. At one point, a handcuffed Mr Floyd, while pinned down on the road next to the police car, gasps that he cannot breathe, adding: ""You're going to kill me, man."" This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting Mr Chauvin, who is shown in bystander footage appearing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. ""It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk."" The transcripts show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Mr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. In response to one of the demands to see his hands, Mr Floyd says: ""Man, I got, I got shot the same way, Mr Officer, before."" It is not clear what he is referring to. This video can not be played Why monuments in the US are being taken down At one point Mr Lane says: ""Why's he getting all squirrelly and not showing us his hands and just being all weird like that?"" The officers then handcuff Mr Floyd and try to put him into the back of their police car. As they do, Mr Floyd becomes agitated, repeatedly pleading that he is claustrophobic. Mr Lane asks if he is ""on something"". Mr Floyd replies: ""I'm scared, man."" According to another document, Mr Lane told investigators that once in the car, Mr Floyd began ""thrashing back and forth"". When asked ""So he pushed himself out of the car?"" Mr Lane replied: ""Yeah"". The investigator then asks: ""Versus you guys pulling him out of the car?"" and Mr Lane says: ""Yeah, because the goal is to keep him in the car, we didn't want him coming out again."" Pinned on the ground, according to the transcript, Mr Floyd cries out a dozen times: ""Mama."" What we know about the officers charged over his death He says: ""Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. ""Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead."" Thomas Lane was just days into the job when the incident happened At one point, when Mr Floyd continues to plead he can't breathe, Mr Lane asks Mr Chauvin: ""Should we roll him on his side?"" Mr Chauvin responds: ""No, he's staying put where we got him."" Mr Lane then says: ""Okay. Just worry about the excited delirium or whatever."" Mr Chauvin replies: ""Well that's why we got the ambulance coming,"" and Mr Lane says ""Okay, I suppose"". Mr Chauvin's lawyers have not commented on the documents since they were made public. This video can not be played In June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd's death The transcripts were released in support of a legal bid to dismiss the criminal charges against Mr Lane, a new recruit only days into the job when Mr Floyd's death happened. Mr Lane's lawyer Earl Gray, who filed the documents, argued that it was ""not fair or reasonable"" for his client to stand trial on the charges. The new court documents includea transcript of Mr Lane's interview with investigators,externalfrom Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. In the interview, Mr Lane talked through the first crucial moments of his encounter with Mr Floyd. Mr Lane said he had pulled his gun out and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands after approaching his car and seeing him ""sitting with his hands down below the seat"". Pictures from inside the car Mr Floyd was sitting in before his arrest show two crumpled $20 bills that, according to Mr Gray, were counterfeit. Mr Lane's lawyer said two fake $20 bills were found in the car Mr Floyd was sitting in At the end of the interview, one of the investigators asked Mr Lane if he felt either he or Mr Chauvin had contributed to Mr Floyd's death. ""I object to that. You're not going to answer that,"" Mr Gray said. The incident and the bystander videos that exposed it highlighted deep wounds over racial inequality in the US. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflected years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally. This video can not be played President Trump posed for a photo op outside a church, moments after protesters were cleared by police Police forces, governments and businesses pledged reforms in recognition of the racial inequality that fuelled the protests. Monuments to historical figures with links to slavery in the US and other countries were re-assessed. Some were toppled or vandalised, others were taken down by authorities and institutions. Mr Floyd's death followed the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Why US protests are so powerful this time Five pieces of context to understand protests Tipping point for racially divided nation 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"This video can not be played Sir Mark Sedwill: The decision to stand down was ""amicable"". The UK's top civil servant will receive a payout of almost Â£250,000 when he steps down in September. Sir Mark Sedwill confirmed he was leaving Whitehall last month as Boris Johnson announced plans to split his role as cabinet secretary and national security adviser into two posts. His exit follows reports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team in Downing Street. On Wednesday, the PM signed off the Â£248,189 pension contribution. The amount was recommended by Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm, with advice from Civil Service Human Resources and legal advisers, before being agreed by Mr Johnson. In a note from No 10, the PM said the payment was ""likely to be in the form of a pension contribution"" for Sir Mark. What do the UK's 450,000 civil servants actually do? UK's top civil servant announces exit Profile: Sir Mark Sedwill Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Mark told the National Security Strategy Committee he had not ""resigned"" but left his post ""by agreement"" with the PM. ""We had concluded it was time to split the jobs again and have a separate security adviser and separate cabinet secretary,"" he added. Sir Mark said the timing was ""at his initiative"", as it was ""never my intention to do that [job] long-term"", but the departure was ""entirely amicable"". The UK's chief negotiator in post-Brexit trade talks with the EU, David Frost, will take over as national security adviser as a political appointee. The Cabinet Office has published a job advert for the cabinet secretary position, with a salary of Â£200,000, and the role is open to current and former permanent secretaries. The person who gets the position will advise the prime minister on implementing policy and the conduct of government. Dominic Cummings, regarded as the prime minister's most influential political adviser, has long called for an overhaul of the civil service. Sir Mark is a career diplomat who served as Ambassador to Afghanistan during a 20-year career in the Foreign Office, before working alongside former Prime Minister Theresa May as the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. He took over as cabinet secretary at short notice followingSir Jeremy Heywood's death in November 2018. Asked about reports of anonymous briefings from Downing Street against him, Sir Mark told the committee that civil servants had become ""fair game"" and it ""goes with the territory"". He added: ""It is never pleasant to find oneself, particularly as an official, in the midst of stories of that kind. ""I don't think it is ever pleasant in government, whether it is against ministers, between them and particularly against officials, when you have briefings to which you cannot really reply, particularly those that are off the record and sniping away. ""But it is a regrettable feature of modern politics, I'm afraid."" After he leaves government service in September, Sir Mark will be made a peer and will chair a new panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations.

"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home.

In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

"Young people across the UK have had their work, studies and lives upended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many are working from home, while others have been furloughed or even made redundant. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So what did they think ofChancellor Rishi Sunak's speech on Wednesday? Emma-Jayne is an apprentice chef from Dorset, earning Â£5 per hour. She is one of the many workers who were furloughed in the hospitality sector. The scheme was introduced by the government to minimise coronavirus-related job losses, and it pays 80% of staff salaries up to Â£2,500 a month. Although restaurants in England have since been allowed to reopen, Emma-Jayne has only gone back to work part-time. Sunak to give firms Â£1,000 cash bonus to hire trainees UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days While the chancellor announced that firms in England will receive cash bonuses for hiring new apprentices from 1 August, Emma-Jayne feels she's being ""overlooked"". ""I've only just been able to pay my rent and bills on furlough payments,"" she says. ""As well as the business receiving that bonus, the apprentice should get something to support them."" She also expressed concern aboutthe government giving diners 50% off their food bills in August. ""The voucher is all well and good if the UK was clear of Covid-19, but it's not. ""Hospitality desperately needs a boost. But in that same breath, the last thing any business needs is for their staff or customers to be put at risk of infection."" Nairn McDonald, 24, is a full-time carer for his mum and 21-year-old brother. He says that during lockdown they've been shielding. ""Now they can't get out, my role has changed. I'm also picking up prescriptions, doing more errands - so it's a bit more labour intensive."" Costs have also been adding up. Nairn relies on universal credit, the benefit for working-age people in the UK, which he says doesn't ""really go a long way"". As part of his speech on Wednesday, the chancellor announced the ""kickstart"" plan, which will subsidise six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on universal credit, who are at risk of long-term unemployment. Nairn points out that it's crucial that the scheme is ""flexible"" for carers. He also worries about the type of work to be subsidised. ""I was so happy to be the first in my family to go to university. I wanted to get a decent job with a decent wage, but it's not clear what's on offer with the scheme. ""There's also no way that I could think of employment if the risk of bringing Covid-19 back to my household is quite high."" Razzia Gafur, 24, moved to London after finishing her university studies two years ago. But when lockdown started, she decided to isolate with her partner and his family just outside of Leeds. ""I only packed a weekend bag, and I've been here for three to four months now!"" Razzia has since asked her estate agent if she could exit the tenancy agreement, as she's spending Â£700 per month on rent and bills on a property she hasn't been living in. ""They would only let me out of my tenancy if I found a replacement tenant,"" Razzia says, adding that it was difficult to find anyone to take on the flat during lockdown. She wanted the chancellor to do more for tenants in the private rented sector. ""To be honest, I can't say I'm disappointed because I didn't expect any help from the government,"" she says. ""It's definitely solidified the thought that I should be looking to buy my own property, as renting has put me in a more difficult situation."" She adds that that government should use lockdown as an opportunity to educate first-time buyers about the different types of schemes that exist to help them get on the housing ladder. Although the chancellor announceda stamp duty holiday for property salesup to Â£500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, first-time buyers pay no tax up to Â£300,000. Georgia Barks from Peterborough has also been furloughed. The theatre she works at has been closed since the pandemic took hold earlier this year. While the government has announced a Â£1.57bn emergency support packageto help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums, ""it should have been done sooner"", Georgia says. ""When we all looked for entertainment during lockdown, we turned to Netflix, we turned to TV, and to theatre live-streams - we all turned to the arts."" Georgia believes that the chancellor should have extended the furlough scheme,which is due to finish at the end of October, covering costs for theatres which have no confirmed reopening date as of yet. ""There are no shows for people to come see and there is a drop in future bookings because people are waiting to see if dates get moved again. ""It's ridiculous to say [theatres] must contribute when they have no income to do so,"" she says.

"Attractions could, but might not, pass the VAT cut on to ticket prices A reduction in VAT might not cut the price of a family trip to the rollercoasters, but venues hope it may give their sector less of a rocky ride. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a temporary drop in the sales tax from 20% to 5% for attractions, meals and accommodation. A family ticket to the zoo of Â£144 could, in theory, become Â£18 cheaper. But experts predict many businesses will not cut prices, instead using the money to save their ailing businesses. The chancellor said the VAT rate on food, non-alcoholic drink, accommodation and attractions in the UK would be cut to 5% between 15 July and 12 January. In theory, the rate change could mean a couple buying a pub meal costing Â£45 without alcohol would save Â£5.62, while a Â£54.50 one-night stay at a hotel in a family room would see a saving of Â£6.81, according to accountants Deloitte. What is VAT and how does it work? What the chancellor's summer statement means for you Chancellor Rishi Sunak cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs In practice, venues may decide to keep prices the same, but keep the extra money they would have sent to the tax authority. Providers will not refund those who have booked and paid for accommodation later in the summer, because the rate is for when the sale was made. Many of these businesses find themselves on the brink, given they were closed for months during lockdown, and the Treasury believes that the choice should remain with these operators, rather than the government, on whether to pass on savings. Ministers may hope to get somewhere close to the reaction of a VAT cut in 2008, when eight in 10 firms said they passed it on, although that was a much more wide-ranging policy. This latest cut marks a move towards more targeted support for the worst-hit sectors of the economy. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, said: ""This [VAT change] doesn't mean we are out of the woods and there are still significant challenges ahead."" The biggest of these was the rent payments that many of these businesses still needed to pay, despite not having any income for weeks. The policy will mean many businesses in the hospitality sector will be operating on three different rates of the sales tax. Alcohol will see a 20% VAT rate, there is a 0% VAT rate on cold takeaway food, and everything else will now see a temporary 5% rate. This would add an extra administrative burden for the sector, said Alison Horner, from accountants MHA MacIntyre Hudson. There is concern, too, about the timing of the latest cut. Although the summer holidays mean many families will be free to visit attractions, they still may be nervous in doing so. They may be worried about coronavirus. They may not fancy the idea of booking days, or possibly weeks, in advance, as venues have reduced their capacity. They might not like the potential of having to queue at a social distance. If the venues themselves could not increase the number of customers owing to virus restrictions, then the VAT would just be a giveaway not targeted at those who were struggling, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Tax specialist ChasÂ Roy-Chowdhury argued that the chancellor could have delayed any VAT cuts until a vaccine was found and people returned to some kind of normality. This would give the UK economy some significant ""momentum"" at that time, he said, rather than a watered-down version now. Others, including many venues, would argue that without any stimulus now, many of these restaurants, cinemas or attractions simply would not survive until then.

"Plans include a new Â£2bn scheme to create thousands of job placements for young people The chancellor announces a temporary change to stamp duty - immediately increasing the threshold to Â£500,000 Temporary cut to VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% is announced Chancellor announces new job retention bonus for employers who bring back furloughed staff But Labour says the chancellor has ""put off big decisions"" and should have announced a ""back to work Budget"" A Â£2bn ""green homes grant"" to help make homes more energy efficient is also unveiled âEat out to help outâ vouchers that will give diners 50% off their meals out, with conditions, for August Paul Seddon and Kate Whannel Chancellor at the despatch box earlier this afternoon That's the end of our live coverage of the chancellor's economic update today. Below is a selection of
the key announcements -you
can read a full summary here- andhere's our news story.  The Chancellor serving customers in a central London restaurant. After his speech in the Commons, this afternoon Rishi Sunak visited a branch of the restaurant chain Wagamama in Central London. The chancellor chatted to customers, served them lunch and asked how they felt about being out and about after the lockdown. Speaking to the media afterwards the chancellor said, the government had been right to act ""in the way we have during this crisis"". ""Weâve stepped in, weâve limited long term damage. But in the medium term we will and must return to a position of financial sustainability."" Former chair of Pizza Express Luke Johnson has been speaking to Radio 4's PM programme. He says: âThese are extraordinary
announcements for a government to be making â¦ every bit is helpful."" On whether theAugust voucherswill work he says: âI think a lot of people are still frightened and so every
inducement that can be brought to bear to encourage people to get back to their
habits of eating and spending and working is good news. âI think the government must also help with its messaging
and communications â¦and start encouraging people, as they have in other
countries, to get back to a degree of usual behaviour and that will allow
businesses to survive and jobs to be maintained.â Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts says some of the chancellor's measures are welcome including support for young people getting into work. However she urges the government to look at extending furlough schemes for those sectors hard hit by the crisis such as tourism. She also says she would like to see furlough extended in those areas where a local lockdown is implemented. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says ""I fear - just as the government was slow to act on the health consequences they are being far too slow to respond to the economic consequences of Covid-19. ""Many of those who have been furloughed will soon be unemployed... I fear we are about to enter levels of mass unemployment."" He says Â£1,000 isn't enough for employers in various sectors that had their businesses closed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the government will pay firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends in October. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The Chancellor has just outlined another hefty chunk of spending to try to prop up the economy, specifically to try to keep millions of people from joining the dole. Many of the measures run against traditional Tory instincts. And there isn't a whiff of how any of it will be paid for for at least another couple of months. But that's against the background of the sharpest decline in the economy in generations, with the fortunes of what will actually happen next dependent on the progress of a deadly disease. The opposition parties already suggest that the scale of what the government is proposing falls short of what will be required. Rishi Sunak admitted in his statement ""our plan will not be the last - it is the next"", knowing full well that the profound economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is far from passed.

Rishi Sunak has confirmed the
governmentâs furlough scheme will close in October. He
says this will be a ''difficult moment'' and that some jobs will not be
protected. The
scheme has been paying up to 80% of the wages of nine million people who canât work because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Furlough
was designed to help support employees and businesses in hard-hit sectors, and
prevent mass redundancies. Furloughed
employees can now go back to work part-time, and from August, employers will have to pay National Insurance
and pension contributions for their staff. In
September, they will have to pay 10% of their furloughed employees' salaries -
rising to 20% in October. There
are concerns there may be significant job losses when the scheme finishes, and
the chancellor has offered firms a Â£1,000 bonus for every furloughed employee
they keep on until the end of January, and pay at least Â£520 a month. Read
more about the rights of furloughed employeeshere. Clive Docwra, Managing Director
of construction consultancy McBains, said it is important to get the economy moving but that the ""long-term outlook is not great"". ""Many developers are hesitant about committing to new projects against a backdrop of coronavirus, and it's likely the government will need to provide ongoing support for some time to come â or, at the very least, until an effective treatment or vaccine is found,"" he says. However he welcomed measures such as theKickstart schemeand traineeship money which he said would ""give developers confidence
that returning to full operational capacity may well be a risk worth taking.â Reality Check During
his speech, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: âAnalysis
Iâm publishing today shows our interventions significantly protected peopleâs
incomes, with the least well off in society supported the most.â The
analysis does suggest that the lowest-paid benefited most - you can find the analysis documenthere.,external It
doesnât quite show the least well off âin societyâ being supported the most â
itâs only an analysis of households with a working member before coronavirus, so those relying on benefits or pensioner households are
not included. Also,
the analysis assumes that nobody will be paid more than the Â£2,500 maximum
offered by the furlough scheme (it ignores top-ups by employers) which means
high-earning furloughed households are bound to lose out more. For
example, somebody being furloughed who normally earned Â£5,000 a month would be
assumed to lose Â£2,500 a month in earnings, while somebody normally earning
Â£2,500 a month would only lose Â£500 a month â clearly in that model the lower
paid would be doing better. BBC Sounds What does todayâs summer statement mean for your job, your wages or your business? Let the#yourworkyourmoney,externalpodcast team answer your query, just post your question on social media including the hashtag. And listen via@bbcsounds,externalhttp://bbc.in/3iHz1XK,external Thomas Woollard hopes businesses will invest in young people on the new job placements Thomas Woollard is 21 years old and has begun the process of applying for Universal Credit. He plans to look into the Chancellor's placement scheme for young people in more detail. âIâd like to see if it would benefit me,"" he says. ""If I can get on to
the scheme and get some income from somewhere Iâll definitely consider it."" Thomas also wonders whether businesses will invest in the people on the scheme or just take the free labour the government is offering. He adds: âWill businesses see this as an investment in themselves, in the country and invest in young people or will they just take the paid work
they are given?"" James Storey is landlord of a small stand-alone pub in Gateshead. He says that the chancellor's plans won't help people like him. ""I run a small pub which is not linked to the major breweries. I won't benefit from the hospitality plans as we don't serve food. ""Also, due to social distancing rules, I only have 17 seats available on my premises. ""I originally had four staff prior to lockdown. Two are not coming back as they have new jobs in the NHS call centre. ""Many customers will continue to use cheap supermarket booze and drink in open spaces. ""There is nothing in this announcement for small local pubs"". Gina Broadhurst, co-founder of the ForgottenLtd Campaign for small limited company directors, said: ""It makes no sense for the government to reward companies for bringing employees back from furlough or creating new apprenticeships if those same companies are going out of business. She says ""hundreds of thousands of small business owners employing millions of people have received zero support and are on the verge of collapse."" ""For them, the chancellor's silence was deafening. While the cut in VAT for the hospitality industry is to be welcomed, as are the job creation and apprenticeship schemes, millions of small businesses are still missing out on support. Caroline Nokes, Chair of Women and Equalities Committee has welcomed the ""speedily delivered and far reaching"" measures in the chancellor's economic statement. But she said, ""the lack of focus on using his three-point plan to boost gender equality is a missed opportunity. ""There was no mention of helping businesses in sectors where women are disproportionately represented and which remain shut down, for example the beauty industry. ""It was disappointing to hear no mention of government support for the childcare sector, which predominantly employs women. We know that affordable, reliable childcare is key in enabling women to return to work and stay in work."" Our teams have been working on some guides to help make sense of what today's announcements means. Here's a round-up of our explainers: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Today's announcement is not just about trying to protect jobs but also encouraging employers who might still be having a very difficult time, to keep employees in work. The government also know that another huge package is not necessarily going to be enough to stop some people losing their jobs What they are trying to avoid is mass unemployment. This isn't the end of it - there's a question of how this is going to be paid for. All that is to come - and that could be a much more difficult day for the chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Rishi Sunak has just finished taking questions from MPs in the Commons. Chancellor cuts VAT in emergency plan to save jobs. Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government is offering a
carrot to businesses if they hang on to their workers. Â£1,000 for every worker who returns from
furlough who is still employed at the end of January. The government says it
could cost up to Â£9bn â a pretty blunt calculation of 9 million furloughed
workers multiplied by Â£1000. Of course it wonât be that simple. The calculation facing business owners is more complicated. Do they want to
start paying 5% of employee wage costs next month, then 14% in September and
then over 20% in October â followed by three months of full wages to land a
prize of Â£1,000 during the worst recession in living memory. A lot of that will be contingent
on demand, which the chancellor has tried to stimulate in the worst-affected industries by cutting VAT andoffering half-price early bird food, but
it is surely wildly optimistic to think that employers will hang on for that
long. We also learned two other
important things today. First, that any idea of extending the furlough scheme â
as many have called for in some form - appears dead. Second, the government and
business are realising just how much they need each other. These programmes are big and
challenging to deliver. Rishi Sunak said early on that today is not the last
intervention but the next intervention. The biggest question of all â the question that may determine the future of hundreds
of thousands of workers - is whether heâs made his carrot big enough. Labour's shadow justice's secretary David Lammy has tweeted his concern that law firms are not being supported. ""A Law Society survey of small firms in April found that 71% of small firms fear cashflow issues could force their closure within 6 months. ""But not a single word in the government's Plan for Jobs to protect them,"" he says. BlackRock, one of the world's largest pension and money managers, offers a gentle warning in what it describes as ""this blurring of monetary and fiscal policy"" as very low interest rates and big government spending take off, not just in the UK, but around the world. ""While there is little likelihood of material near-term
inflation, once we look out further into this decade, this blurring of monetary
and fiscal policy could bring about upside inflation risks globally,"" said Vivek Paul, Chief Investment Strategist for
     the UK, BlackRock Investment Institute, the research wing of the firm. He says investors might consider looking at inflation-linked government bonds rather than the vanilla variety. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Coronavirus has dealt a blow to incomes, job prospects and our future prosperity. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has delivered a summer statement, outlining his ambitions for a recovery from the economic harm done by the virus. This is how it might affect your finances. Policies announced by the chancellor on homes, tax and insulation are, in many ways, dwarfed by the prospects for people's jobs. Wages remain key for the health of an individual's finances. Mr Sunak announcedvarious schemesto give incentives to employers to bring furloughed employees back to work, to encourage them to employ young workers, and to improve skills training. The sales tax - VAT - included in the cost of food, accommodation and attractions will be cut until mid-January from 20% to 5% The temporary cut should see prices fall when eating out or going out, which should help those whose income has been affected by the virus. However, it is not clear how much benefit consumers will see. For example, lots of people are staying away from holidays and attractions at the moment, worried about the virus and their ability to spend money. There is also a question over whether there is the capacity to let them in, given social distancing. Another point of debate is whether these businesses will pass on the VAT cut in the form of lower prices. Many in the sector will consider this an opportunity to shore up the finances of their ailing businesses. This means they may, in effect, keep the extra money by not cutting their prices. The chancellor said that there will be discounts of up to Â£10 per head for anyone eating out at participating restaurants from Mondays to Wednesdays in the month of August. Diners who often make use of money-off vouchers may find this mirrors their normal discount. Until now, in England and Northern Ireland, stamp duty has been paid on land or property sold for Â£125,000 or more. There are different rates and systems in Scotland and Wales. Buyers usually pay their duty based on the price on the day the sale is completed, and they have to give the money to HM Revenue and Customs within 14 days. Now, the chancellor has said this threshold in England and Northern Ireland will increase - with immediate effect  - to Â£500,000 until 31 March. He said that, on average, people buying a home would save Â£4,500. Current homeowners moving on could see a saving of up to Â£14,999. The housing market, as with the rest of the economy, has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The lockdown meant activity slowed sharply, with sales at half the levels of a year earlier. The idea is that housing chains will get moving again, as people make the most of the stamp duty holiday. That would be good for everyone on that chain, and for the UK economy as a whole (of which the housing sector is a key part). Yet, back in 2012, the then-chancellor George Osborne said a stamp duty holiday had been ineffective in helping people to buy a home when he cancelled a similar scheme. There is also a limit on how much first-time buyers would benefit from this. Stamp duty holiday: How will it work? Some 16% of sales in England were not liable for stamp duty, even before now. Many would be first-time buyers. Before the chancellor's announcement, first-time buyers paid no tax on properties up to Â£300,000 and 5% on any portion between Â£300,000 and Â£500,000. So the new stamp duty holiday would not benefit many of those young, new buyers directly. Those buying homes for more than Â£500,000, or second homes, will still have to pay stamp duty, but their total bill will be lower as a result of these changes. Mr Sunak will not pay to paint the kitchen, but there will be help with the cost of insulating your home, including double glazing, in England. In the scheme, which will start in September, the government will pay at least two-thirds of the cost of home improvements that save energy. This will be paid as a voucher when the work is approved. For example, a homeowner of a semi-detached or end-of-terrace house could install cavity wall and floor insulation for about Â£4,000 - the homeowner would pay Â£1,320 while the government would contribute Â£2,680. Low-income households could receive a bigger contribution. The movewas announced in the build-up to the speech, and will allow landlords to benefit, which could eventually see tenants' gas and electricity bills look better than they would otherwise have done.

"Mike and Sally Stuart are full of joy after saving Â£8,000 on stamp duty ""When I found out that we were going to have a stamp duty holiday, I jumped for joy,"" says Sally Stuart. The Salford-based university lecturer reckons the chancellor's announcement on Wednesday will save her and her husband about Â£8,000. ""We're in the middle of buying our Â£346,000 dream home and have agreed a completion date of 30 July. ""it means we'll have some money to use when we move in. The house needs some work doing to it, so we can use it there."" Sally and husband Mike - a software developer - have both been working from home during the coronavirus crisis. They started home hunting in February and quickly found the house they wanted. ""But then Covid happened and we were at the stage of searches which meant everything stopped. It was really frustrating,"" Sally says. How will the stamp duty holiday work? It was only when the lockdown started easing, and estate agents were allowed to start showing people around again, that it started moving again. ""We're having to think twice about how we'll work in the future, but we'll use some of the extra money to make a little office to work from home. ""It's something I never would have considered before coronavirus times, but the stamp duty holiday has proved to come at just the right time for us."" The timing of the stamp duty holiday - it started on Wednesday 8 July - has angered James Davies. ""We're almost Â£10,000 out of pocket, because we completed a week ago,"" he says. ""It should be backdated to help the ones that didn't pull out of their house purchase."" James Davies is angry that the stamp duty holiday has not been backdated In March, all looked rosy for James and his wife, who lived in Preston. ""I had a nice job, my wife had recently got a new job in the tourism industry and we rescued two golden retrievers. ""We all know what happened next."" The couple decided to continue with their purchase of their new home in East Riding of Yorkshire despite lockdown: ""We just didn't want to let the coronavirus win!"" James says. They paid the deposit on their new home last Wednesday, 1 July, and paid Â£9,750 in stamp duty tax. On the same day, James was made redundant from his job in the food industry, where he was an account manager in the airline and restaurant/foodservice sector. ""Our new situation means we could really do with that money now and it would make a huge difference to us. ""We carried on paying solicitors, the mortgage broker, surveyors, van rental guys, a storage unit, spending thousands of pounds believing in our government to do right by us if there was a stamp duty holiday. ""Now we feel let down. It feels like we've been penalised. If they backdated it to the beginning of the month, we would qualify for the holiday."" On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary holiday on stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland until next March. He said the move would save the average house buyer Â£4,500. There has been a mixed reaction to the news. ""The chancellor's announcement should give a welcome boost to the housing market and in turn, have positive knock-on effects for the wider economy,"" said Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance. ""The stamp duty holiday might have a positive indirect impact on a long list of related industries, such as house builders, conveyancers, estate agents, finance and insurance providers, house movers and furniture and garden retailers,"" said Jamie Ward, head of stamp taxes at PwC. But critics said the temporary move needed to be longer. ""It gives little opportunity for house builders to use the reduction to inform strategic decisions on construction plans beyond the next nine months,"" said Chris Denning, partner at MHA MacIntyre Hudson. ""Making the stamp duty cut temporary is a gamble,"" warned David Westgate, group chief executive at Andrews Property Group. ""Cliff-edge deadlines completely distort the market and rarely benefit the consumer."" He warned of ""a boom scenario"" between now and April next year, ""when a disproportionate number of people are buying at higher prices"". Sarah Ryan, head of conveyancing at law firm Simpson Millar, called on the government to make the scheme retrospective to help people like James Davies. ""For people who have managed to complete on the purchase of their home either during lockdown, or in the immediate aftermath, this will come as a bitter blow,"" she said.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's cut to the rate of value added tax (VAT) on hospitality and tourism from 20% to 5% has now started. It lasts until 31 March 2021 (it was originally due to end on 12 January, butthe period has been extended) and applies to food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Mr Sunak said the move is designed to""get the sectors moving and to protect jobs"",but what is VAT and how does it work? Value added tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things like children's car seats and home energy. The lower rate also currently applies to sanitary products, although in the March 2020 Budget, the government announcedit will stop charging VAT on these goods from 1 January 2021. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted in Marchthat VAT would raise Â£136.6bn in 2019-20.,external That is equivalent to around Â£4,800 per household and represents 16.8% of all the money the government receives from taxes. VAT accounts for around 6.2% ofGDP, the total value of goods and services produced in the economy. In 2018-19 VAT was the third biggest income generator for the UK government, after income tax and national insurance contributions. These three taxes togetherraise more than half of government tax receipts.,external For most families in the UK, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. You can see that in the dark green bars in the chart below. But poorer households tend to pay a bigger share of their taxes through taxes on spending: VAT and duties - the blue areas in each bar. Those are known as indirect taxes. For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax that is paid. The standard rate of VAT increased from 17.5% to 20% on 4 January 2011. In 2008, following the financial crash, the government introduced a temporary cut in the rate of VAT to 15%. The rate cut lasted from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009and cost the government Â£12.4bn in lost revenue.,external The aim of the cut was to boost consumer spending with retailers expected to pass the reduction on to customers. At the time, opinion was divided about the policy with then Conservative leader David Cameron calling it an ""unbelievable and expensive failure"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies was more supportive.It predicted a growth in sales of about 1%,externaland said a VAT cut compared well with other incentives. Measuring the overall impact proved challenging, because no-one could know what would have happened without the rate cut. Mr Sunak's six-month cut for hospitality and tourism is set to cost the government Â£4.1bn. The Treasury estimates households could save Â£160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. For example, Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Britain,said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. And many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. However, Starbucks has said it will pass on the full 15% discount on coffee served in company-operated stores. McDonald's has recommended that its franchisees cut prices on an array of products, and pub chain Wetherspoon said it would reduce prices on meals, coffee and soft drinks. The UK's VAT rate of 20% seems to be roughly in the middle when compared with European Union countries.
