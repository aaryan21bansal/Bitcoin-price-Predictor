"The US trade gap with the rest of the world jumped to a 10-year high of $621bn (Â£472.5bn) last year, dealing a blow to President Donald Trump's deficit reduction plan. The trade deficit is the difference between how much goods and services the US imports from other countries and how much it exports. Reducing the gap is a key plank of Mr Trump's policies. But in 2018, the US exported fewer goods compared with how much it bought. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Mr Trump claims that the US is being ""ripped off"" by other nations and wants countries to lower their tariffs on US goods and buy more of them. However, official data shows that while exports of US goods and services rose by $148.9bn last year, imports jumped by $217.7bn. It means that the gap is the widest since 2008, when the global financial crisis hit and the US fell into recession. The deficit in goods and services during December also hit a near 10-year high of $59.8bn. Exports to the rest of the world fell 1.9% to $205.1bn, while imports rose by 2.1% to $264.9bn. The US is currently locked in a trade battle with China over what it claims are unfair trade practices, resulting in tit-for-tat tariff increases on each others' goods. Allow Twitter content?

Both nations are in discussions and there is speculation they could reach an agreement by the end of March. New data shows that the trade gap between the US and China widened last year by $43.6bn to $419.2bn as exports of American products and services fell, but imports from China rose. It was one of Donald Trump's signature campaign promises. Back in June 2016, he stood before a large crowd in Monessen, Pennsylvania and said that as President, he would reduce America's ballooning trade deficit. He called it ""a political and politician-made disaster"" and said ""it can be corrected"". Only it hasn't exactly turned out that way. Last year, Mr Trump introduced tariffs on steel and aluminium from around the globe and on a range of imports from China. The idea was that the tariffs would make imports more expensive, thereby discouraging Americans from buying foreign goods and services and shrinking the trade deficit. But the opposite has happened. Instead, Donald Trump goes into the presidential re-election race having failed to deliver on his campaign promise to close the US trade deficit. Part of the problem is Mr Trump's own tax policies. They boosted US consumption and a lot of that spending went abroad. This happened as growth was slowing in other parts of the world, contributing to a rising dollar. That made US exports more expensive and less competitive. Of course, an economic downturn would help reduce the trade deficit. But who wants that? Mr Trump warned in December that if the two countries failed to reach an agreement on trade, he would take action, dubbing himself ""a Tariff Man"". The deficit between the US and the European Union also increased in 2018, up by $17.9bn to $169.3bn. Following the same trend as with China, US export growth to the EU was eclipsed by imports of European goods and services to America, which last year rose to $487.9bn. Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker reached a truce on trade last year Followinga spat between the US and the EUwhen America lifted tariffs on steel and aluminium, Mr Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year reached a truce. However, Mr Trump may choose to lift tariffs on European cars and parts after the US Commerce Department produced a report examining whether the imports threaten national security. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom are meeting on Wednesday in Washington, where the issue of allowing America's agriculture industry access to Europe is expected to be discussed.

"A total of 72 people were killed as a result of the fire in June 2017 Campaigners have reacted with frustration at news that criminal charges over the Grenfell Tower fire may not be considered until 2021. Scotland Yard said it would not hand a file to prosecutors until the end of a public inquiry into the disaster. Survivors' group Grenfell United said families were disheartened by a lack of official progress. But police said it ""would be wrong"" not to take into account evidence given to the independent hearing. A total of 72 people werekilled as a result of the firein June 2017. The first phase of the inquiry, which centred on the night of the fire, ended in December. Chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the second phase was unlikely to start until the end of 2019. Grenfell United chair Natasha Elcock said the news about criminal charges was ""extremely frustrating and disheartening"". ""We are living in a limbo with no individuals or organisations being held accountable and it is so painful for all of us who lost loved ones and our homes that night,"" she said. ""We wait month after month, our lives on hold, for some kind of justice and progress."" Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Ms Elcock said the group, which represents survivors and bereaved relatives, had yet to be told details of the next stage of the inquiry. ""Vague reassurances are wearing thin,"" she said. ""Families need clear commitments to keep faith in this process"". The Met said it would be ""wrong"" not to wait for the final report from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Lead investigator Det Supt Matt Bonner said the timelines of the inquiry and the police probe were ""inextricably linked"". He said officers must ""consider all relevant information"", including evidence and findings from the inquiry, for their investigation to be ""considered thorough and complete"". At the close of the inquiry's first phase last year, Sir Martin said 200,000 documents had yet to be disclosed to the inquiry - a process set to take until this autumn. Scotland Yard said: ""The Met's assessment is that any file submission to the Crown Prosecution Service is unlikely to be sooner than the latter part of 2021."" Det Supt Bonner said officers were in regular contact with Grenfell survivors and bereaved families and had informed them of the timeline. ""I know this is longer than some might have anticipated, but the police must ensure all the available evidence is considered before any file is submitted to the CPS,"" he added. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said while the delay would be ""distressing"" for families and survivors, he could understand why the police would ""want to make sure there is a proper investigation"".

"Ian Ogle had acted as a spokesman for the loyalist community A court has heard that a 32-year-old man accused of murdering Ian Ogle told his daughter he was returning from Thailand to clear his name. Mr Ogle wasstabbed and beaten close to his home at Cluan Place, east Belfast, on 27 January. Glenn Rainey, of McArthur Court, was arrested at Manchester Airport on Sunday evening. At Belfast Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, he nodded to indicate he understood the murder charge. A detective confirmed she could connect him to the date and place of the murder, before outlining more details about what happened. She said that a number of people had been involved in an assault at a chip shop on the Beersbridge Road earlier that evening and claimed that Jonathan Brown, 33, of McArthur Court, who has also appeared in court charged with murdering Mr Ogle, organised a reprisal attack. Shortly before 21:00 GMT, CCTV captured five men with their faces covered walking towards Cluan Place. The detective said their case is that one of these men, wearing a bobble hat with a red scarf over his face and a distinctive jacket, was Mr Rainey. Mr Ogle's family sobbed from the public gallery when the detective explained how the CCTV footage had captured five men assaulting Mr Ogle, stabbing him 11 times in just over 30 seconds. The court was shown CCTV footage of the man in the red scarf and distinctive jacket allegedly walking away after the fatal attack, and heard that four independent witnesses saw three men getting into a nearby Seat Leon a short time later. ""I would say that one is Mr Rainey,"" the detective said, and later added that the CCTV provided a ""circumstantially quite strong case to connect"". She said that Mr Brown abandoned the vehicle and went to an address in east Belfast, where a ""forensic clean-up"" took place until the early hours. ""Clothing disposed of, shoes, weapons involved,"" she added. Less than 24 hours later, she said, Mr Rainey fled to Thailand from Dublin through Moscow to Bangkok. It emerged that he paid cash for the one-way ticket, and was travelling with his co-accused Mr Brown. Neither carried any luggage. She said that Mr Rainey's telephone showed a ""flurry of activity of calls between Rainey and Brown commencing after the assault outside the chip shop"" but she said there was no activity during the time of the murder. The court also heard that four days before the assault, Mr Rainey was captured on CCTV in a bank, withdrawing Â£3,000 in cash. The footage shows him wearing a distinctive jacket similar to that worn by one of those involved in Mr Ogle's murder. It emerged that the potential knife and baton used in the assault were recovered in the Connswater River, close to the address where police claim the clean-up took place. A forensic expert said the knife was consistent with the one used in the attack. It is understood that Mr Rainey had been involved in an ongoing feud with the Ogle family since July 2017. The defence solicitor said that the prosecution case was tenuous, with no evidence to connect his client with the murder and that the police had identified Mr Rainey from his distinctive jacket. The lawyer said ""in these circumstances several pieces of material innocent in themselves were tied together by a jacket which anyone could have... this is simply not enough material before the court to justify the charge"". He added that this was his clients fourth trip to Thailand - ""going somewhere on holiday where you habitually go is simply not enough"", he added. The detective said that Mr Rainey's visa would have run out by the time he had returned to the UK, and that while material from his daughter's phone said he was ""coming back to clear his name"", he made no comment over six police interviews. Mr Rainey was remanded in custody to appear again via videolink on Friday.

"This video can not be played Senator Martha McSally: ""I was ashamed and confused"" A US senator has said that she was raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force. Senator Martha McSally, who was the first female US fighter pilot to fly in combat, was speaking at a hearing on sex assaults in the military. The Arizona Republican said she did not report the rape as she felt ashamed and confused, and distrusted the system. In 2017 nearly 6,800 sexual assaults were reported in the US military, a 10% rise on the previous year. Ms McSally, 52, was speaking on Wednesday during a hearing,externalof the Senate Armed Services subcommittee featuring victims of sexual assault. ""The criminal actions reported today by Senator McSally violate every part of what it means to be an Airman,"" an Air Force spokeswoman said in a statement in response to her testimony. ""We are appalled and deeply sorry for what Senator McSally experienced and we stand behind her and all victims of sexual assault."" Ms McSally said she hoped to give sexual assault survivors hope by revealing her experience. ""Like you, I also am a military sexual assault survivor, but unlike so many brave survivors, I didn't report being sexually assaulted. Like so many women and men, I didn't trust the system at the time,"" she said. ""I blamed myself. I was ashamed and confused,"" she said. ""The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways. In one case I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer."" US marines in nude photo sharing scandal Gruelling test for female US marines Martha McSally (L) and Senator Joni Ernst, who recently said she was raped in college Ms McSally said she attempted years later to share her experiences with senior officers but met with ""wholly inadequate responses"". ""I almost separated from the Air Force at 18 years of service over my despair,"" she said. ""Like many victims, I felt like the system was raping me all over again."" Senator Kristen Gillibrand of New York, the top ranking Democrat on the committee, said she was ""deeply affected by that testimony"". Ms McSally served 26 years in the US Air Force, rising to the rank of colonel, before retiring in 2010. She was then elected for two terms in the US House of Representatives, before becoming a senator in January. It is not the first time Ms McSally has spoken about being a survivor of sexual abuse. Last year, while running for the Senate, she told the Wall Street Journal her high school athletic coach had pressured her into having sex with him when she was 17. She has previously said she was sexually harassed while in the military. In January, another female senator said she had been raped. Joni Ernst, an Army combat veteran, said she was sexually assaulted by an abusive boyfriend while she was a student at Iowa State University. The Iowa Republican told Bloomberg she did not report the incident to police. US senator: I was raped.

"This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Victims' families have called for the Northern Ireland secretary to resign over comments she made about the Troubles. Karen Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were ""not crimes"". She later clarified that ""where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated"". John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". ""Her place now is untenable - she should go,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said the secretary of state should resign. ""What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father - 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body - that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way. ""For Mrs Bradley to come out with insulting, despicable insults to families, it's an absolute disgrace."" Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney met Mrs Bradley in London on Wednesday evening, during which he intended to discuss her comments. ""The position of the Irish Government is clear,"" his department said. ""There should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.""

Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley was responding to a question from DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly about legacy issues. ""Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists, every single one of those was a crime,"" she said. ""The fewer than 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. ""They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also called for Mrs Bradley's resignation. In a tweet, Mr Eastwood wrote: ""Karen Bradley is publically interfering with the rule of law. No-one has the right to deliberately pressure or intervene with due process. She should resign."" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neilltweeted,external: ""These comments are an insult to families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the British army, state agencies and their proxies in the loyalist death squads which were directed by the British state. ""These offensive and hurtful comments should be withdrawn immediately."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there should not be a one-sided approach to dealing with the past. ""We have been involved in discussions with the government to support our veterans, against the witch hunts against them,"" he said. ""However no-one should be above the law and all innocent victims deserve justice."" Later on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley returned to the chamber to clarify her comments. ""The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, and integrity and within the law,"" she said. ""I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible. ""These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities who are independent of government."" The son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane, John Finucane,tweeted that her original comments were ""indefensible"",external. ""Legally, politically and morally indefensible, yet is it really surprising to hear a [secretary of state] publicly express the contempt we know the British [government] had for lives here?"" Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Pat Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught in a 2012 review of the murder proposed by the then prime minister David Cameron. Mark Thompson, from victims' organisation Relatives for Justice, said: ""It is absolutely odious and reprehensible that they would stand up and say killings by the state are justified and that they are legitimate."" Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport The latest comments from Karen Bradley come at a particularly sensitive time, asan announcement is expected soon on whether any prosecutions will be brought in relation to the infamous Bloody Sunday killings. Campaigners for victims of state violence in Northern Ireland were quick to slam the secretary of state's comment that the security forces involved in killings were ""fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way"". Perhaps Mrs Bradley meant to use those words about soldiers and police officers who were found to have acted within the army's rules of engagement, but as she delivered her remarks in the Commons she appeared to be granting absolution to all security force personnel regardless of the circumstances. Whatever the case, there's no doubt that as the Bloody Sunday announcement draws closer, the government is under pressure from many of its own backbenchers and DUP MPs angered over what they regard as a ""witch hunt"" directed at military veterans. Less than an hour after Mrs Bradley spoke, Theresa May was on her feet dealing with the same issue, and confirming that the Ministry of Defence is considering potential legislation designed to ensure - in the prime minister's words that ""service personnel are not unfairly pursued through the courts"". However as those proposals are drawn up, you can expect they will provoke renewed controversy on either side of the debate over Northern Ireland's troubled past. Last year, Theresa May saidthe system for investigating the past in Northern Ireland was ""unfair"". The prime minister said only people in the ""armed forces"" or ""law enforcement"" were being investigated. However, in 2017, figures obtained by the BBC challenged claims thatTroubles investigations unduly focused on those committed by the Army.

"The TV presenter was rarely seen without her trademark sunglasses TV presenter Magenta Devine, known for her appearances on Channel 4's Network 7 and BBC Two's Rough Guides to the World, has died after a short illness. According to her family, the 61-year-old had been undergoing treatment at a central London hospital. Known for her sunglasses and stylish attire, Devine - real name Kim Taylor - was born in Hemel Hempstead in 1957. Her other credits include presenting ITV documentary series Young, Gifted and Broke from 1999 to 2001.

"EOD carried out a controlled explosion Counter terrorism police officers have said the suspect package found at Glasgow University is linked with devices discovered around London. Bomb disposal officers detonated the item after it was found in the mailroom on Wednesday morning. Police Scotland is now ""working closely together"" with officers investigating finds at Heathrow and London City airports and Waterloo station. Staff and students were evacuated from buildings and no-one was injured. Classes were expected to return to normal on Thursday. A controlled explosion took place on a suspect device found at Glasgow University Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. ""Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem. ""Our inquiries into the Glasgow package are at an early stage but there is no ongoing risk to the public."" He added: ""Anyone who sees something suspicious should report it to the police immediately."" University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Suspicious package sees University of Essex evacuated Lectures and tutorials were cancelled and roads cordoned off The university,externalsaid it was acting under advice from Police Scotland as it closed a number of buildings, cancelled classes and sent staff home. The package was discovered just one hour before another suspicious item was discovered at the University of Essex. A 100m cordon was placed around a section of the university whileEssex Police launched an investigation. On Tuesday three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London, the Metropolitan Police said. Scotland Yard said the packages were all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. One caught fire when opened by staff at Heathrow. The airport said it would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". London explosive packages: Police 'can't confirm' Irish terror link A number of police cordons in and around University Avenue in the west end of Glasgow remain in place until further notice. Police made clear, however, there was no ongoing risk to the public. A number of buildings at the University of Glasgow were closed off including the Boyd Orr Building, the mailroom, OTC, Wolfson Medical Building and Bower Building. Others sites that were later closed included the Isabella Elder Building, James McCune Smith Learning Hub, the Joseph Black Building, the Kelvin Building and University Gardens. Classes in these buildings were cancelled with hundreds of students affected. Staff members were later sent home. University Gardens and part of University Avenue were cordoned off by police. However, at about 16:00, the university tweeted that police had advised the incident was ""now over"". The tweet read: ""Minor restrictions will remain in place around the Isabella Elder building and Botany Gate while the Mailroom will remain closed for now. All other buildings are being reopened.""

"The UK has been urged to submit fresh proposals within the next 48 hours to break the Brexit impasse. EU officials said they would work non-stop over the weekend if ""acceptable"" ideas were received by Friday to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop. The UK has said ""reasonable"" proposals to satisfy MPs' concerns about being tied to EU rules had already been made. Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned Brexiteers to vote for the PM's deal or face a delay to Brexit. No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU Brexit: A really simple guide Live updates: MPs question Attorney General The PM is seeking legally-enforceable changes to the backstop - an insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but there have been few visible signs of progress. MPs are due to vote for a second time on the Brexit deal next week. If they reject the deal again, they will get to choose between leaving without a deal or deferring the UK's exit from the EU beyond the scheduled date of 29 March. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on how he would vote if Mrs May's deal is defeated. ""If the prime minister's deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don't get this deal through."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What we heard from the chancellor this morning was that he was clear about the uncertainties ahead - and rather unclear (cagey, in fact) about how he might vote when it came to decision-time about a no-deal. There was an explicit warning to Brexiteers: vote for the prime minister's deal because otherwise, it's delay and a soft Brexit. As one minister expressed to me yesterday, they believe the vote does have a chance of getting through because Brexiteers will realise - just in time - that it's either the PM's deal next week, or what this minister described as ""soft, softer, then meltdown"". But across government, the mood is not optimistic about what's going to happen next week and most ministers are expecting a defeat. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau reiterated the EU's position that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened and said the deal was the ""best possible solution"" with the controversial Irish backstop a ""last resort solution"". She said: ""We don't like the backstop, we don't want to have to implement it, and if we have to, we don't want to stay in the backstop. ""We all agree that it should be temporary."" Mrs May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to the backstop that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. Critics say that - if the backstop were used - it would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Negotiations between British ministers and the EU officials over the past 24 hours have been described as ""difficult"", with the EU insisting there has been no breakthrough. Diplomats from the 28 member states were told on Wednesday that Mrs May could meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday if progress was made. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button But the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said talk of a 48-hour deadline for new proposals and a weekend of negotiations was ""a notional timetable"" and that more flexibility could be possible. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is leading the UK team, has conceded that negotiations are at a sensitive point and the exchanges have been ""robust"". Mr Cox, who will take questions from MPs on Thursday, has played down reports he has abandoned hopes of getting the EU to agree to a firm end date to the backstop or some kind of exit mechanism - key demands for many Tory Brexiteers. By BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The latest talks aimed at securing legal guarantees about the Irish backstop foundered over a British proposal for the role of the independent arbitration panel which will be set up under the Brexit deal. It will be made up of judges and lawyers, and will handle disputes between the UK and the EU about the withdrawal agreement. The British suggested it have a role in deciding whether the backstop should come to an end - if it's ever needed. But the EU felt that went beyond the panel's remit, which is to ensure each side sticks to the rules - not to make big decisions like the future of the Irish border. Hence the request for the UK to think again. And quickly. Jeremy Corbyn has met Conservative MPsto discuss possible alternatives to the PM's deal. The Labour leader held talks with ex-Tory minister Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, who favour a closer, Norway-style relationship with the EU. He said he had discussed the so-called ""Common Market 2.0 option"" - which would see the UK remain in the EU's single market by staying part of the European Economic Area - but would not commit to backing it at this stage. The government has suffered the first of what are expected to be a number of defeats in the Lords on a key piece of post-Brexit legislation. Peers voted to amend the Trade Bill to call on the government to join a new customs union with the EU after Brexit. The result means MPs now will get a vote on whether to stay in the existing customs union when the legislation returns to the Commons. Ministers also lost a vote obliging them to get Parliament's approval for its negotiating strategy ahead of the next phase of talks on future relations with the EU. This video can not be played Corbyn on Brexit: We are looking at all the options Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said he had agreed to meet Conservative MPs because he was adamantly opposed to a no-deal exit and he wanted to hear ""what their ideas and options are"". While Labour wanted an agreement encompassing a customs union, unhindered access to EU markets and legal protection of workers rights, he said that ""what exact form that takes is subject to negotiation"". Mr Boles said the goal was to reach a cross-party compromise to ensure the UK left the EU but in a manner which protected its economic interests. Allow Twitter content?

"Breck Bednar met his killer online before travelling to meet him Snapchat has been criticised for a delay in handing over data to police investigating claims a murdered boy's family is being taunted by his killer. Chloe Bednar alleges Lewis Daynes, who killed her brother Breck in Grays, Essex, has sent sick messages online. Prime Minister Theresa May described the situation as ""completely unacceptable"". The social media firm said it would ""welcome any efforts that help to speed up"" the international legal process. Daynes isserving a life sentence for the murder of 14-year-old Breck, from Caterham in Surrey. The pair met through a gaming website and Daynes lured him to his flat and stabbed him to death in 2014. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Chris Philp MP said Breck's family had received ""very distressing and disturbing"" online messages purporting to be from Daynes. He said the messages ""graphically recounted"" the murder. Daynes was sentenced to life with a minimum of 25 years in 2015 Croydon South MP Mr Philp said police had asked Snapchat to provide data that would ""help them definitively identify who has been sending these messages"". However, he said the social media firm had referred police to a ""mutual legal assistance treaty with the US"", that required a ""one-year process to get this vital data for their investigation"". Mrs May said the Ministry of Justice was ""urgently looking into this issue"". The prime minister said the government expected to reach an agreement with the US under the new Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act, which would ""give law enforcement agencies the power to obtain electronic data"". Snapchat said: ""We understand how upsetting this situation is for the Bednar family. ""We have provided advice on restoring privacy settings and we have also terminated the user account."" It said it aimed to be ""as helpful as we can"" to police, adding: ""We welcome any efforts that help to speed up the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process whilst allowing for appropriate judicial oversight and avoiding conflicts of law.""

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Prime Minister Theresa May has not listened to police concerns about knife crime, a former head of the Metropolitan Police has said. Mrs May said the deaths of young people were ""appalling"" as she announced an upcoming summit on knife crime. But Lord Stevens told the BBC: ""I don't think she listens, quite frankly, to what she's being told."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was not doing enough to tackle the root causes of knife crime. Senior party members, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan and shadow policing minister Louise Haigh,have written to the PM calling for 10,000 new police officers,externalto help tackle youth violence. 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'I lost my son to knife crime - here's my advice' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives On Wednesday afternoon a man, believed to be in his mid-20s,was fatally stabbed in Leyton, east London, police said. The Met said it had launched a murder investigation and no arrests had been made. Earlier, Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for knife crime to betreated ""like a disease"", and said ""we have to listen to them [police] when they talk about resources"". The most awful political truth about the flare in knife crime is that it is so familiar. From time to time, a flurry of terrible attacks emerges, the public is alarmed and politicians debate what can be done. Frankly then, many of the solutions that are often put forward are familiar too. And for a time, genuinely trying to focus on this kind of violence is a prominent political priority. But also familiar is the narrative where that focus then fades over time and the political grip is loosened. What's difficult for politicians grappling with it this time round is not just that the real solutions might take a long time to pursue and make real - that's a familiar truth. Read more Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Lord Stevens - who was commissioner of the Met between 2000 and 2005 - criticised Mrs May's handling of crime and policing as PM and when she was home secretary. He said the Home Office had not been listening for the past five or six years. ""All you got from the Home Office, and in particular the home secretary at the time, now the prime minister, was 'our reforms are working'. ""She hasn't listened to what's been going on and it's not good enough."" Lord Stevens said he thought Mr Javid was the right person to see the crisis through and called for him to chair the upcoming summit on knife crime at 10 Downing Street. ""He's got the personality, he's got the empathy. He understands the difficulties on the streets and he understands the difficulties the police are facing."" The issue of knife crime was debated by Mrs May and Mr Corbynduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mrs May began PMQs by saying any deaths through violence were an ""appalling tragedy"" and young people were dying in a ""growing cycle of violence that has shocked us all"". The prime minister said she would hold a summit in No 10 in the coming days with ministers, community leaders and victims to explore what can be done. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of not doing enough to tackle the ""root cause"" of the rise in knife crime and of trying to keep communities ""safe on the cheap"". He said 285 people were stabbed to death last year in England and Wales - the ""highest level ever"" - before asking if she regretted ""cuts in police numbers"". Mrs May replied: ""We are putting more resources into the police this year - it's no good members on the opposition benches standing up and saying 'no you're not', it's a fact more money is being put into the police this year, that more money is being put into the police next year."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Theresa May served as home secretary for six years when forces in England and Wales faced deep budget cuts and - on her instructions - drastically reduced the use of stop-and-search. That is why claims that a shortage of police resources and fewer searches have contributed to the surge in serious violence appear to be so uncomfortable for her. If correct, it would mean her policies were in some way responsible. In contrast, the current incumbent, Sajid Javid - whose brother is a chief superintendent in West Midlands Police - has no prior record at the Home Office to defend. He won over officers at his first Police Federation conference - where Mrs May had once been booed and jeered - by promising more resources and backing the use of stop and search. After today's meeting, he repeatedly said how important it was to ""listen"" to the police - a coded message to his boss, if ever there was one. Earlier, Mr Javid met police chiefs from the seven forces in England and Wales most affected by violent crime, during which funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed. The UK's top police officer, Cressida Dick,said there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbersin England and Wales after Mrs May had previously insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". Asked for his view, Mr Javid said: ""I think police resources are very important to deal with this. We've got to do everything we can. ""I'm absolutely committed to working with the police in doing this. We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease, and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" The former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, told the BBC the police need to feel supported over the use of stop and search. In 2014, Mrs Mayrestricted the use of the tacticas home secretary, arguing that it undermined public confidence in the police when it was misused. But Mr Johnson said: ""What the police want to hear is this is something that is actively supported, and they'll be backed up in showing real determination in cracking down.""

A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousefand has been remanded in custody. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie.

"This video can not be played The attack was caught on CCTV inside the Home Bargains store An ""arrogant and selfish"" father has been jailed for 16 years for organising a ""monstrous"" acid attack on his three-year-old son. The boy suffered burns to his face and arms in the attack at the Home Bargains store in Worcester in July last year. Prosecutors said the man, 40, had enlisted others in a bid to ""manufacture"" evidence to discredit his estranged wife during a custody battle. Five other men were jailed at Worcester Crown Court for their part in the plot. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and the five men were found guilty after a six-week trial of plotting to spray sulphuric acid on the boy with intent to harm. A seventh defendant, Martina Badiova, 23, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, was found not guilty of the same charge. Convicted were, clockwise from top left, Jan Dudi, Jabar Paktia, Norbert Pulko, Adam Cech and Saied Hussini Judge Robert Juckes QC, sentencing, told them they had carried out a ""monstrous"" crime with ""obviously strong acid"", probably from a car battery. He said: ""It is an extraordinary thing in this case that not one of you, most of whom have no previous convictions, most of whom with families of your own, at any stage stood back and asked the question of yourself and others: 'what are we doing?'"" The five convicted co-conspirators were: Adam Cech, 27 of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, 25, of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, 22, of Sutherland Road, London Jabar Paktia, 42, of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton Saied Hussini, also 42, of Wrottesley Road, London Hussini, who was said to have tested the strength of the acid on his arm before the attack, was imprisoned for 14 years, while the other four were each jailed for 12 years. Man 'forced to squirt boy, 3, with acid' Acid attack accused 'in surveillance team' Latest news from the West Midlands Following the sentencing, the boy's mother said she ""couldn't sleep for weeks"" after the attack and had ""repeat nightmares about what happened that day"". ""It shocks me to think that people could be involved with doing this to a defenceless child,"" she said. ""It has been extremely hard to accept that my three-year-old child has been attacked in such a way and that his father was behind this. She added: ""How will I explain this to my son?"" The court had heard the father, from Wolverhampton but originally from Afghanistan, was the ""driving force"" behind the attack in the Tallow Hill area on 21 July. His wife left him, taking their three children, in 2016. The trial was told the defendant was seeking greater access to his children and he wanted to create evidence of injuries to show his wife to be an unfit mother after she opposed the application. The boy has made a good recovery following the attack in Tallow Hill area of Worcester Cech, Dudi and Pulko were captured on CCTV at the scene of the attack after following the boy and his mother to the store from their home in a Vauxhall Vectra. Cech approached the child in the shop and squirted acid at him from a small plastic medicine-type bottle, claiming in the trial he had been threatened with a gun to do it. Footage then showed the three men calmly making their escape, Pulko even stopping at the tills to buy two items. After the attack, the boy screamed ""I hurt"" over and over again, jurors were told. He has since made a ""good recovery"" and is living with his mother. Hussini alleged the father - who he had been introduced to by Paktia - had been willing to pay Â£3,000 to carry out the job, and claimed it was Pulko who first suggested using acid. The father had denied knowing Pulko, despite being caught on CCTV ""handing over acid"" to him in a pub car park on the day of the attack. He also claimed to have only hired Hussini and Paktia as ""private investigators"", while Dudi alleged he was just there to watch the mother - and no more. The attack followed what prosecutors claimed had been an ""aborted attack"" at a school eight days earlier. During that incident, Pulko and Hussini were seen by neighbours loitering in the area. Ms Badiova told the court she took part in the ""aborted"" attack believing she was only there to make another man's boyfriend jealous. Supt Damian Pettit of West Mercia Police said: ""This was a horrific attack on an innocent young boy, whose scars will prove a constant reminder of that awful day.""

"Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted to develop Facebook into a network focused around privacy Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has said he believes secure, private messaging services will become more popular than open platforms. In a blog,external, Mr Zuckerberg outlined his vision to transform Facebook into a ""privacy-focused platform."" Facebook owns Messenger and WhatsApp, but message encryption limits its ability to make money through targeted adverts. The social media giant has come under fire for a series of privacy scandals. Facebook revamps its privacy controls WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger to 'merge' In 2018, it emerged that the data of about 50 million users had been harvested and passed on to a political consultancy. Some critics see the proposed changes as a way of Facebook perhaps abandoning its responsibilities, says the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee. If what happens on Facebook is more private and temporary, he says, it may be harder to hold the site accountable for any perceived misdeeds. ""Facebook and Instagram have helped people connect with friends, communities, and interests in the digital equivalent of a town square,"" said the billionaire founder of Facebook. ""But people increasingly also want to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room."" In response, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted to develop the social media network into one focused around privacy, reducing permanence, and secure data storage. As part of his privacy goals, he said Facebook would not ""store sensitive data in countries with weak records on human rights like privacy and freedom of expression."" ""Upholding this principle may mean that our services will get blocked in some countries, or that we won't be able to enter others anytime soon. That's a tradeoff we're willing to make,"" he continued. Mr Zuckerberg added that encrypted messaging will also create scope for new business tools, especially ones around online payments and commerce. He did not offer a firm timeline for his vision, but said changes would take place ""over the next few years"". ""I believe we should be working towards a world where people can speak privately and live freely knowing that their information will only be seen by who they want to see it and won't all stick around forever. "" ""If we can help move the world in this direction, I will be proud of the difference we've made,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. What we are seeing is potentially a very new direction for Facebook. You could argue that it is finally listening to what its users want and responding to their changing habits, rather than introducing its own ideas and then responding to the influx of feedback afterwards - seeking forgiveness rather than permission is not uncommon in the tech sector. Or you could more cynically point out the looming threat of social network regulation coming its way from various governments around the world, and suggest that this new hands-off approach to data (we won't store it, we won't even be able to see it) might help it survive a clampdown on how it uses people's information. The shift to more intimate communications between smaller groups, making those conversations private even from Facebook itself, and no longer keeping data for a long period of time is no doubt designed to address the tech giant's poor track record on privacy in recent times. As Mark Zuckerberg himself notes: ""Frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services"". Facebook has been sharply criticised in the past over lack of user privacy and the spread of offensive content and ""fake news"". Close to $80bn (Â£61bn) was wiped offFacebook's share value in just dayslast March over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The UK-based consultancy was accused of misusing the data of millions of US Facebook members. Cambridge Analytica denied using the data to aid US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016, and claims it had deleted the information in line with Facebook's policies. However, the company's chief executive was soon suspendedfollowing further allegations. Despite the scandal, Facebook  says its user numbers have continued to grow. According to Facebook, the number of people who logged into its site at least once a month jumped 9% last year to 2.32 billion people. User numbers in the US - its second-largest market - have fallen by 15m since 2017 however, according to market research firm Edison Research.

"Lewis Ludlow is a Muslim convert who used the name Ali Hussain and was nicknamed ""The Eagle"" An Islamic State (IS) supporter who planned to kill 100 people in a ""spectacular"" terror attack in London has been jailed. Lewis Ludlow, 27, from Rochester, Kent, was going to target Oxford Street with a bomb-laden truck after being refused permission to leave the UK. The Old Bailey heard he planned the attack after being told to make the British people ""pay in their blood"". He was sentenced to life imprisonment and will serve a minimum of 13 years. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said he was satisfied that Ludlow was ""engaged in preparations to launch a spectacular multi victim attack"". ""Multiple deaths were risked and very likely to be caused,"" he said. How Oxford Street terror plotter was caught Muslim convert Ludlow, who called himself ""The Eagle"", carried out reconnaissance of central London targets and filmed a pledge of allegiance to IS. Detectives recovered torn-up notes from bins outside his home which listed potential targets, including the Disney Store on Oxford Street, and said as many as 100 people could be killed in an attack using a bomb-laden truck. He had also considered attacking Madame Tussaud's and St Paul's Cathedral. Ludlow carried out reconnaissance of central London targets Sentencing him, Judge Hilliard said Ludlow had ""shown an interest in extremism for a number of years"" which involved a ""deep and genuine attachment to its objectives"". He described him as ""nobody's fool"" and said he was not being forced to do anything by a Philippines-based IS militant, with whom Ludlow was plotting. ""I do not regard you as suggestible or easily taken advantage of, "" he said. ""You were an enthusiastic participant in a joint plan."" He dismissed a claim by Ludlow made during hearings earlier this year that he had disengaged from the terror plot early on. He also said there was no evidence that Ludlow had changed his mindset before being arrested in April last year. The judge said Ludlow's autism and depression did not explain his ""participation in these offences"", and added that his ""adherence to violent Jihad"" was the ""result of free choices made by you"". Ludlow made detailed notes of possible targets in London The former Royal Mail worker, who called himself ""The Ghost"", had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group and was communicating with an IS militant in the Philippines. He had planned to join the group in that country but his passport was revoked, leaving him feeling like ""a trapped animal unable to escape from its cage"". In a video shown in court, Ludlow said: ""I have nothing for this country of Britain. I spit on your citizenship, your passport, you can go to hell with that."" Ludlow said the cancellation of his passport ""literally broke my heart"" and he had then been encouraged by his Filipino contact to carry out a terror attack in the UK instead. Hepleaded guiltyin August to preparing acts of terrorism, but claimed he had abandoned the idea. He also admitted funding IS abroad and was sentenced to a further seven years in prison to run concurrently. Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), said: ""I have no doubt that Ludlow was fully intent on committing a serious violent act."" Update 26 March 2019: This story has been amended following a revision of Ludlow's sentence. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC cut the sentence to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 13 years and two and a half months, down from 15 years. The Old Bailey judge said there had been an error in calculating Ludlow's discount for pleading guilty.

"This video can not be played Specialist paramedics are trying to free up ambulance crews in Lincolnshire The most critically injured patients in rural areas are at risk due to the time it takes the ambulance service to reach them, a BBC investigation has found. Some rural communities wait more than 20 minutes on average for 999 crews or trained members of the community to get to immediately life-threatening cases like cardiac arrests and stab victims. A response should come in six to eight minutes, depending on where you live. Experts said delays could make the difference between life and death. This was particularly the case for cardiac arrests where ""every second counts"", the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said. For the full interactive experience, please update your browser or enable JavaScript. Loading interactive map... Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Source: Ambulance trusts. Data is shown for postcode districts with more than nine highest category callouts in January-October 2018. Districts with 10-49 callouts are labelled ""low numbers"". Northern Ireland does not use comparable categorisation. Click here if you cannot see the interactive map,external Wells-next-the-Sea has longest wait for ambulances Ambulance bosses accepted some responses took longer than they should but said staff were working hard in ""challenging circumstances"" due to the levels of demand and the remote nature of some locations. They said expert advice was provided over the phone until a response arrived. Using the Freedom of Information Act, BBC News has obtained the average response times for the most life-threatening callouts in more than 2,700 local communities across Britain. These times cover the point at which a trained person reaches the patient - so it could be an ambulance or volunteers trained by the service to respond to these highest-priority cases. These calls include: cardiac arrests stab wounds major blood loss seizures patients not breathing or struggling to breathe women in the end stages of labour They represent about one in 20 emergency cases the ambulance service deals with, and are prioritised above all others because of the risk to life. The BBC News investigation shows there are some rural areas in Britain where it took over 20 minutes on average for the ambulance service to reach a patient during January to October last year. That compares with responses in under five minutes in a number of town and city neighbourhoods. Across all the communities in Britain, the average response time for rural areas was 11 minutes 13 seconds - more than 50% longer than the seven minutes 14 seconds it takes in urban areas. Northern Ireland categorises emergency calls differently to England, Wales and Scotland. Every moment counts for these patients - none more so than the cardiac arrest cases. Research has shown that if patients are given all the treatment immediately, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation - an electric shock to restart the heart, about two-thirds can survive. But every minute delay reduces survival by 10%. And this is one of the reasons why there has been a big emphasis on putting defibrillators in community settings and encouraging people to learn how to do CPR. Judy O'Sullivan, of the BHF, said it was ""critical"" that expert help from the ambulance services arrived as ""quickly as possible"". But she said CPR from ordinary members of the public was also vital - in the UK, this happens in less than half of cardiac arrests that occur out of hospital. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every second counts,"" Ms O'Sullivan added. There are different targets depending on where you live in the UK. In England, ambulance services are expected to reach patients within an average of seven minutes. That has to be a ""trained response"" - but this can include community first responders, who can be members of the public and off-duty health professionals, who have been given special training to deal with life-threatening conditions until an ambulance crew arrives. In Scotland the expectation is that at least half of patients will be reached in six minutes. In Wales, the target is that most patients are reached in eight minutes  - but having a defibrillator on scene and ready to use even if it is in the hands of a member of public counts as a response. The most immediately life-threatening calls are prioritised above all others by the ambulance services. And ambulances are automatically dispatched to the scene when one comes in. But control-room staff, such as Sue Hinton, who works for the West Midlands service, also step in to see if there are any other options if it looks like it will take some time to reach the patient. She likened it to a ""game of chess"", with crews stationed at different points in a region to give them the best chance of responding. ""You are constantly moving people around trying to get to the patients in the quickest time,"" she said. And rural areas were particularly ""challenging"" because of the distances involved, narrow roads and - when the weather was bad - the difficulty getting around. ""We utilise everything we have to get to patients as quickly as we can,"" Ms Hinton said And this included seeing if there were closer crews that could be diverted from other jobs as well as putting calls out to community first responders who may be closer to the scene and often know the areas better than ambulance crews. ""These trained volunteers are invaluable in rural areas,"" she added. It depends on how you cut the figures. BBC News analysed 586,000 emergency responses across more than 2,700 different postcode districts. About one in 10 callouts was to rural areas. There were 300 districts that had a very small numbers of critical cases, including some remote parts of Scotland where there was just one callout during the 10 months looked at. Some of these took over an hour to reach. There were 2,400 locations that had at least 10 callouts and a number of areas that waited over 20 minutes for a response. But to obtain a trustworthy response time for a local area, BBC News judged, there needed to have been at least 50 callouts over the time period - more than one a week. There were 2,000 locations with that level of demand. The single longest wait was seen in the NR23 postcode in and aroundWells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast, followed by RH14, in Chichester, Sussex. One former community responder in Wells-next-the-Sea told the BBC he resigned because of the length of time he was left with badly-injured patients before ambulance crews arrived. These waits also were longer than those in any district with more than 50 callouts in Wales or Scotland but the differences in the way response times are measured may be a factor in that. Ambulance services say they are expected to achieve the average target response times on a regional and national level only - not down to the super-local level looked at by BBC News. They also say there are other measures of performance, including the expectation that nine in 10 top-category callouts be reached within 15 minutes, that they perform better on. Nonetheless, ambulance chiefs accept they would like to do better. Anthony Marsh, who chairs the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the levels of demand and the remoteness of some areas presented ""challenging circumstances"" for the service. ""Our staff are working flat out to deal with record number of 999 calls, to reach all patients as quickly as they can whether they live in rural or urban areas,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly given the very rural nature of the majority of our country, there will be cases where we are longer to arrive than we would prefer."" Mr Marsh also pointed out control-room staff would, if needed, stay on the phone line to offer ""expert advice"" until help arrived. And he called on more members of the public to get trained in basic life support, so they would know what to do if faced with an emergency. Other steps are also being taken to improve the speed of responses. In some area,  police and fire crews have been enlisted and trained to respond to calls, while the BHF is in the process of working with ambulance services to map where defibrillators are - large numbers have been bought privately and are not registered on ambulance systems.

"This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Victims' families have called for the Northern Ireland secretary to resign over comments she made about the Troubles. Karen Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were ""not crimes"". She later clarified that ""where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated"". John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". ""Her place now is untenable - she should go,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said the secretary of state should resign. ""What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father - 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body - that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way. ""For Mrs Bradley to come out with insulting, despicable insults to families, it's an absolute disgrace."" Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney met Mrs Bradley in London on Wednesday evening, during which he intended to discuss her comments. ""The position of the Irish Government is clear,"" his department said. ""There should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.""

Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley was responding to a question from DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly about legacy issues. ""Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists, every single one of those was a crime,"" she said. ""The fewer than 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. ""They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also called for Mrs Bradley's resignation. In a tweet, Mr Eastwood wrote: ""Karen Bradley is publically interfering with the rule of law. No-one has the right to deliberately pressure or intervene with due process. She should resign."" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neilltweeted,external: ""These comments are an insult to families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the British army, state agencies and their proxies in the loyalist death squads which were directed by the British state. ""These offensive and hurtful comments should be withdrawn immediately."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there should not be a one-sided approach to dealing with the past. ""We have been involved in discussions with the government to support our veterans, against the witch hunts against them,"" he said. ""However no-one should be above the law and all innocent victims deserve justice."" Later on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley returned to the chamber to clarify her comments. ""The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, and integrity and within the law,"" she said. ""I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible. ""These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities who are independent of government."" The son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane, John Finucane,tweeted that her original comments were ""indefensible"",external. ""Legally, politically and morally indefensible, yet is it really surprising to hear a [secretary of state] publicly express the contempt we know the British [government] had for lives here?"" Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Pat Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught in a 2012 review of the murder proposed by the then prime minister David Cameron. Mark Thompson, from victims' organisation Relatives for Justice, said: ""It is absolutely odious and reprehensible that they would stand up and say killings by the state are justified and that they are legitimate."" Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport The latest comments from Karen Bradley come at a particularly sensitive time, asan announcement is expected soon on whether any prosecutions will be brought in relation to the infamous Bloody Sunday killings. Campaigners for victims of state violence in Northern Ireland were quick to slam the secretary of state's comment that the security forces involved in killings were ""fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way"". Perhaps Mrs Bradley meant to use those words about soldiers and police officers who were found to have acted within the army's rules of engagement, but as she delivered her remarks in the Commons she appeared to be granting absolution to all security force personnel regardless of the circumstances. Whatever the case, there's no doubt that as the Bloody Sunday announcement draws closer, the government is under pressure from many of its own backbenchers and DUP MPs angered over what they regard as a ""witch hunt"" directed at military veterans. Less than an hour after Mrs Bradley spoke, Theresa May was on her feet dealing with the same issue, and confirming that the Ministry of Defence is considering potential legislation designed to ensure - in the prime minister's words that ""service personnel are not unfairly pursued through the courts"". However as those proposals are drawn up, you can expect they will provoke renewed controversy on either side of the debate over Northern Ireland's troubled past. Last year, Theresa May saidthe system for investigating the past in Northern Ireland was ""unfair"". The prime minister said only people in the ""armed forces"" or ""law enforcement"" were being investigated. However, in 2017, figures obtained by the BBC challenged claims thatTroubles investigations unduly focused on those committed by the Army.

"Two Tory councillors have quit after being accused of sharing Islamophobic posts on social media. Len Milner and Chris Smith, who sit on East Staffordshire council, ""liked"" a cartoon posted on Facebook depicting a mock beheading of Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Milner said he had been cleared of wrongdoing by the council but had quit to avoid upsetting the party. It comes amid claims that the party has ""buried its head in the sand"" over the extent of Islamophobia in its ranks. Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi has claimed senior officials ignored her warnings about the prevalence of anti-Muslim prejudice and Theresa May had failed to get to grips with the issue. She widened her attack on senior figures on Tuesday, accusing Home Secretary Sajid Javid of ""dog whistle"" politics for comments he had made about grooming of young girls by young Muslim men. PM's 'head in sand' over Tory Islamophobia ""I've called out Sajid on at least three occasions now on the language that he has used to deal with some very important technical and legal issues,"" she told BBC Politics Live. ""I've told Sajid very clearly that he is better than this."" The Conservatives say they have taken swift action when told about Islamophobic activity. On Monday, 14 Tory members were suspended for allegedly liking offensive comments posted on a Facebook group. In East Staffordshire, the two members of the party, including the current Mayor Chris Smith, have resigned amid claims they endorsed Islamophobic posts. The posts appear to have been deleted from their respective Facebook accounts. But Labour members on the council said one featured a meme of the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, being beheaded while being knighted. This video can not be played Baroness Warsi on Theresa May: ""She doesn't listen, she fails to acknowledge when there is a problem"" Members of the Labour group walked out of a council meeting on Monday ""in solidarity"" with Muslim colleagues and to ""stand up to racism"". Mr Milner quit after being suspended by the party although he insisted his decision had nothing to do with the Conservatives beginning an internal investigation. The East Staffordshire Conservative Association confirmed that Mr Smith had also resigned. ""We are a proudly anti-racist association and will not tolerate any form of prejudice including Islamophobia or anti-Semitism,"" its treasurer Aaron Bell said. Mr Milner said the police had examined his Twitter history and told him ""there is nothing that gives any cause for concern and nothing that indicated right wing tendencies or affiliations"". East Staffordshire Council said its decision not to take action against Mr Milner did not mean that it had ""exonerated"" him. It said its investigation had concluded the tweets ""were not unlawful and while it is the case that people may disagree with the contents of his posts, or even be offended by them, that would not be sufficient to interfere with his right to freedom of expression"". Meanwhile, a Conservative councillor in Kent has apologised,externalfor re-tweeting a message hailing the former English Defence Leader Tommy Robinson as a ""patriot"". Andrew Bowles, who has led Swale Borough Council for 16 years, was suspended after appearing to back a message criticising Facebook's decision to ban the anti-Islamic activist from its pages. The message contained a doctored image of the movie The Patriot featuring Mr Robinson's face superimposed on the body of the main character, played in the film by Mel Gibson. Facebook bans Tommy Robinson's page It said Mr Robinson's Facebook ban was due to him being ""racist to Muslims"", arguing that this was a ""disgraceful injustice"" and ""this corruptness needs to stop"". Mr Bowles said he had not meant to endorse Mr Robinson's ""racist and intolerant views"" which he found abhorrent. Instead, he wanted to make the point that ""silencing"" him risked turning him into a martyr. He said he would attend a training course on acceptable social media conduct. Facebook removed Mr Robinson's official page and Instagram profile last month, saying its contents violated its policies on hate speech and the social network's community standards. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said anyone engaging in Islamophobic activity or any kind of bigotry had no future in the party. But he told BBC Radio 4's World at One he did not agree with Baroness Warsi it was an institutional problem. ""The Conservative Party has demonstrated that it deals with these things robustly,"" he said. ""I would remind the country that what we do with a Muslim in the Conservative Party is make him home secretary.""

"The UK has been urged to submit fresh proposals within the next 48 hours to break the Brexit impasse. EU officials said they would work non-stop over the weekend if ""acceptable"" ideas were received by Friday to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop. The UK has said ""reasonable"" proposals to satisfy MPs' concerns about being tied to EU rules had already been made. Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned Brexiteers to vote for the PM's deal or face a delay to Brexit. No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU Brexit: A really simple guide Live updates: MPs question Attorney General The PM is seeking legally-enforceable changes to the backstop - an insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but there have been few visible signs of progress. MPs are due to vote for a second time on the Brexit deal next week. If they reject the deal again, they will get to choose between leaving without a deal or deferring the UK's exit from the EU beyond the scheduled date of 29 March. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on how he would vote if Mrs May's deal is defeated. ""If the prime minister's deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don't get this deal through."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor What we heard from the chancellor this morning was that he was clear about the uncertainties ahead - and rather unclear (cagey, in fact) about how he might vote when it came to decision-time about a no-deal. There was an explicit warning to Brexiteers: vote for the prime minister's deal because otherwise, it's delay and a soft Brexit. As one minister expressed to me yesterday, they believe the vote does have a chance of getting through because Brexiteers will realise - just in time - that it's either the PM's deal next week, or what this minister described as ""soft, softer, then meltdown"". But across government, the mood is not optimistic about what's going to happen next week and most ministers are expecting a defeat. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau reiterated the EU's position that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened and said the deal was the ""best possible solution"" with the controversial Irish backstop a ""last resort solution"". She said: ""We don't like the backstop, we don't want to have to implement it, and if we have to, we don't want to stay in the backstop. ""We all agree that it should be temporary."" Mrs May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to the backstop that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. Critics say that - if the backstop were used - it would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Negotiations between British ministers and the EU officials over the past 24 hours have been described as ""difficult"", with the EU insisting there has been no breakthrough. Diplomats from the 28 member states were told on Wednesday that Mrs May could meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday if progress was made. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button But the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said talk of a 48-hour deadline for new proposals and a weekend of negotiations was ""a notional timetable"" and that more flexibility could be possible. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is leading the UK team, has conceded that negotiations are at a sensitive point and the exchanges have been ""robust"". Mr Cox, who will take questions from MPs on Thursday, has played down reports he has abandoned hopes of getting the EU to agree to a firm end date to the backstop or some kind of exit mechanism - key demands for many Tory Brexiteers. By BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The latest talks aimed at securing legal guarantees about the Irish backstop foundered over a British proposal for the role of the independent arbitration panel which will be set up under the Brexit deal. It will be made up of judges and lawyers, and will handle disputes between the UK and the EU about the withdrawal agreement. The British suggested it have a role in deciding whether the backstop should come to an end - if it's ever needed. But the EU felt that went beyond the panel's remit, which is to ensure each side sticks to the rules - not to make big decisions like the future of the Irish border. Hence the request for the UK to think again. And quickly. Jeremy Corbyn has met Conservative MPsto discuss possible alternatives to the PM's deal. The Labour leader held talks with ex-Tory minister Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, who favour a closer, Norway-style relationship with the EU. He said he had discussed the so-called ""Common Market 2.0 option"" - which would see the UK remain in the EU's single market by staying part of the European Economic Area - but would not commit to backing it at this stage. The government has suffered the first of what are expected to be a number of defeats in the Lords on a key piece of post-Brexit legislation. Peers voted to amend the Trade Bill to call on the government to join a new customs union with the EU after Brexit. The result means MPs now will get a vote on whether to stay in the existing customs union when the legislation returns to the Commons. Ministers also lost a vote obliging them to get Parliament's approval for its negotiating strategy ahead of the next phase of talks on future relations with the EU. This video can not be played Corbyn on Brexit: We are looking at all the options Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said he had agreed to meet Conservative MPs because he was adamantly opposed to a no-deal exit and he wanted to hear ""what their ideas and options are"". While Labour wanted an agreement encompassing a customs union, unhindered access to EU markets and legal protection of workers rights, he said that ""what exact form that takes is subject to negotiation"". Mr Boles said the goal was to reach a cross-party compromise to ensure the UK left the EU but in a manner which protected its economic interests. Allow Twitter content?

"The government has promised action to protect women in England and Wales from unwanted images of male genitals on their smartphones. According to a 2017 YouGov poll,external, 41% of 18 to 36-year-old women had received such images, which they found threatening and distressing. The government - whichhas banned upskirting- said it would look at options for preventing cyber-flashing. The commitment is part of a crackdown on violence against women and girls. Some smartphone apps allow users to send anonymous pictures to others in their immediate vicinity, meaning women in restaurants, train carriages and other public places are at risk of seeing unsolicited explicit photos on their phones. 'Why I send photos of my genitals to women' How one woman responded to an unwanted penis photo MPs on theWomen and Equalities Committee last year,externalcalled for ""a new law on image-based sexual abuse which criminalises all non-consensual creation and distribution of intimate sexual images"". In an updated version of itsViolence against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategy,external, published earlier, the government said it would look at the committee's recommendations and ""whether there is more we can do to address this"". In the YouGov survey, 46% of women aged under 36 said they have been sent a photo of a penis, with 41% saying they had not asked for it. Only 22% of the men surveyed admitted to sending such a picture and only 5% admitted sending an unsolicited picture. YouGov surveyed 2,121 women and 1,738 men (all aged 18-36) between July and September 2017. The government has also said it will commission research into ""what links exist between consumption of online pornography and harmful attitudes towards women and girls"" and the causes, impacts and influencers of body dissatisfaction. Previous studies have examined connections between porn and sexual violence, but the new analysis will investigate whether there is any broader link to harmful attitudes towards women. Other plans explored in the strategy include: A statutory code of practice for employers on sexual harassment Work with online dating apps to raise awareness among users Consider the impact of alcohol on violence against women and girls Develop further measures to support lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender victims The strategy also promises a review of the way sexual offences are handled by the police and the courts, following an ""alarming"" fall in charges being brought. The volume of ""rape-flagged"" referrals from police fell by nearly a tenth in 2017-18, while the number of suspects charged by the CPS dropped by 23%. Convictions were down by just under 12%, although the conviction rate went up slightly. This data includes cases initially reported as rape allegations, but where charges for other offences were subsequently brought. The strategy also sets out plans for research to consider whether, as has been suggested by some academics, ""rape myths"" may be negatively affecting the ability of juries to analyse the evidence and make informed, objective judgements on the merits of each case. Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said: ""Violence against women and girls strikes at the heart of our families, friendships and communities and it is our responsibility to bring light, justice and support to victims and survivors.""

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"EOD carried out a controlled explosion Counter terrorism police officers have said the suspect package found at Glasgow University is linked with devices discovered around London. Bomb disposal officers detonated the item after it was found in the mailroom on Wednesday morning. Police Scotland is now ""working closely together"" with officers investigating finds at Heathrow and London City airports and Waterloo station. Staff and students were evacuated from buildings and no-one was injured. Classes were expected to return to normal on Thursday. A controlled explosion took place on a suspect device found at Glasgow University Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. ""Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem. ""Our inquiries into the Glasgow package are at an early stage but there is no ongoing risk to the public."" He added: ""Anyone who sees something suspicious should report it to the police immediately."" University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Suspicious package sees University of Essex evacuated Lectures and tutorials were cancelled and roads cordoned off The university,externalsaid it was acting under advice from Police Scotland as it closed a number of buildings, cancelled classes and sent staff home. The package was discovered just one hour before another suspicious item was discovered at the University of Essex. A 100m cordon was placed around a section of the university whileEssex Police launched an investigation. On Tuesday three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London, the Metropolitan Police said. Scotland Yard said the packages were all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. One caught fire when opened by staff at Heathrow. The airport said it would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". London explosive packages: Police 'can't confirm' Irish terror link A number of police cordons in and around University Avenue in the west end of Glasgow remain in place until further notice. Police made clear, however, there was no ongoing risk to the public. A number of buildings at the University of Glasgow were closed off including the Boyd Orr Building, the mailroom, OTC, Wolfson Medical Building and Bower Building. Others sites that were later closed included the Isabella Elder Building, James McCune Smith Learning Hub, the Joseph Black Building, the Kelvin Building and University Gardens. Classes in these buildings were cancelled with hundreds of students affected. Staff members were later sent home. University Gardens and part of University Avenue were cordoned off by police. However, at about 16:00, the university tweeted that police had advised the incident was ""now over"". The tweet read: ""Minor restrictions will remain in place around the Isabella Elder building and Botany Gate while the Mailroom will remain closed for now. All other buildings are being reopened."" A spokesman confirmed all university buildings, except the mailroom, were operating as normal. Earlier on Wednesday the Royal Bank of Scotland HQ at Gogarburn in Edinburgh was also evacuated after a similar report. However, Police Scotland confirmed that the package posed no risk to the public and contained promotional goods.

"Michel Barnier is leading Brexit talks on behalf of the European Commission Brexit negotiations ""have been difficult"" and ""no solution has been identified"" to the Irish backstop, the European Commission has said. It comes after the latest talks between UK ministers and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the talks had taken place in a ""constructive atmosphere"" but there had been no breakthrough. The UK is pushing for legally-binding changes to the EU deal. Brexit vote offer to MPs on workers' rights Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? Brexit: A really simple guide Mr Schinas was speaking after Mr Barnier briefed the European Commission's weekly meeting on the state of Brexit talks. Speaking after talks with Mr Barnier, the UK's Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" This video can not be played Liam Fox says leaving the EU without a deal would be ""hugely sub-optimal, compared to getting a deal"". This video can not be played Steve Brine:  ""The idea of some sort of clean break...is utter nonsense."" Downing Street echoed Mr Barnier's characterisation of the talks as ""difficult"", but said the negotiations were ""ongoing"". ""The EU continues to say that it wants this to be resolved and that it wants the UK to leave with a deal. Parliament has been clear that for this to happen, we require legally-binding changes which mean that the UK can't be trapped in the backstop indefinitely,"" said the PM's official spokesman. ""That is what we will continue to pursue."" The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Prime Minister Theresa May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to it that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. She believes this would be enough to get MPs - who last month rejected her deal by an historic margin - to back her deal in a vote she has promised on or before 12 March. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the EU has consistently refused to rewrite the deal it has struck with Mrs May, which is meant to ensure an orderly departure from the bloc on 29 March and pave the way for trade talks. And Mr Barnier repeated that message to EU leaders, according to Mr Schinas. ""Discussions have been difficult and no solution has been identified to that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol which, as you know, will not be reopened,"" he said at a press conference in Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming explained that EU sources said the UK side couldn't guarantee that whatever might end up being agreed in Brussels would even get through Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn is meeting Tory MPs to discuss a Norway-style Brexit Mrs May is also hoping to attract votes from Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas of the UK, as she battles to get her deal through the Commons. She is promising MPs a vote on anychanges to workers' rightsafter Brexit. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button But trade unions said the MPs should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"" and the assurances on workers' rights were ""not worth the paper they are written on"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has met Conservative MPs who back a close, Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. He discussed the idea of a ""Common Market 2.0"" trade-focused model with former ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin. Mr Boles said the goal was to reach a cross-party compromise to ensure the UK left the EU but in a manner which protected its economic interests. Allow Twitter content?

"Michel Barnier is leading Brexit talks on behalf of the European Commission Brexit negotiations ""have been difficult"" and ""no solution has been identified"" to the Irish backstop, the European Commission has said. It comes after the latest talks between UK ministers and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the talks had taken place in a ""constructive atmosphere"" but there had been no breakthrough. The UK is pushing for legally-binding changes to the EU deal. Brexit vote offer to MPs on workers' rights Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? Brexit: A really simple guide Mr Schinas was speaking after Mr Barnier briefed the European Commission's weekly meeting on the state of Brexit talks. Speaking after talks with Mr Barnier, the UK's Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" This video can not be played Liam Fox says leaving the EU without a deal would be ""hugely sub-optimal, compared to getting a deal"". This video can not be played Steve Brine:  ""The idea of some sort of clean break...is utter nonsense."" Downing Street echoed Mr Barnier's characterisation of the talks as ""difficult"", but said the negotiations were ""ongoing"". ""The EU continues to say that it wants this to be resolved and that it wants the UK to leave with a deal. Parliament has been clear that for this to happen, we require legally-binding changes which mean that the UK can't be trapped in the backstop indefinitely,"" said the PM's official spokesman. ""That is what we will continue to pursue."" The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Prime Minister Theresa May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to it that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. She believes this would be enough to get MPs - who last month rejected her deal by an historic margin - to back her deal in a vote she has promised on or before 12 March. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the EU has consistently refused to rewrite the deal it has struck with Mrs May, which is meant to ensure an orderly departure from the bloc on 29 March and pave the way for trade talks. And Mr Barnier repeated that message to EU leaders, according to Mr Schinas. ""Discussions have been difficult and no solution has been identified to that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol which, as you know, will not be reopened,"" he said at a press conference in Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming explained that EU sources said the UK side couldn't guarantee that whatever might end up being agreed in Brussels would even get through Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn is meeting Tory MPs to discuss a Norway-style Brexit Mrs May is also hoping to attract votes from Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas of the UK, as she battles to get her deal through the Commons. She is promising MPs a vote on anychanges to workers' rightsafter Brexit. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button But trade unions said the MPs should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"" and the assurances on workers' rights were ""not worth the paper they are written on"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has met Conservative MPs who back a close, Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. He discussed the idea of a ""Common Market 2.0"" trade-focused model with former ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin. Mr Boles said the goal was to reach a cross-party compromise to ensure the UK left the EU but in a manner which protected its economic interests. Allow Twitter content?

"A review has been carried out of policing at football matches A report into policing in Scottish football has identified serious concerns around stadium safety which are putting fans at risk. Findings included incidents of clubs gaining safety certificates without stadium inspections and selling more tickets than the ground capacity. Rangers' away games while in the lower leagues prompted serious concerns. Unsafe temporary scaffolding was discovered, with safety certificates altered to increase stadium capacity. The report states,external: ""This review highlights a lack of strategic oversight and co-ordination to ensure a corporate approach to safety certification. ""The review takes the view this gap should be seen as a significant risk to the safety of spectators and be addressed with the utmost priority."" The report, which was commissioned by Police Scotland followinga crush outside Celtic Parklast year, also highlighted a need for better stewarding and better engagement with fans. However, Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, who was tasked with compiling the report, says overall the current policing of Scottish football is fit for purpose. His team looked at operational planning for matches, intelligence gathering and allocation of police resources on match days. Police Scotland announced they hadasked Dep Ch Con Mark Roberts to conduct the reviewone month after a crush at Celtic Park, but insisted the review was not triggered by a particular incident. Dep Ch Con Roberts told BBC Scotland news: ""Some of the examples that were quoted do give rise for concern and I think it does require a degree of urgent attention. ""I would like the Scottish government to look at the framework to make sure people are properly discharging their responsibilities."" This video can not be played Steward who celebrated goal 'completely unprofessional' He did take some positives from the findings, highlighting individuals from the SPFL and from the SFA ""going above and beyond"" to identify risks and prevent them by working with police. He said: ""What you have is lots of professional, competent people, committed to Scottish football, trying to make a system work but they are not being supported by a system."" The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) vice chairman David Hamilton said he ""fully supported"" the recommendations made in the review - adding the issues surrounding safety at grounds were ""utterly devastating"". He continued: ""Such a review also opens up the potential to extend licensing arrangements to consider the community impact, travel plans and fan behaviour beyond the footprint of the stadia. ""This would force clubs to take greater responsibility for their fans not just at games but on their way to games too."" Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said he felt ""reassured"" by the report's findings, but pointed to how the issue of stadium safety has been subject to much public and political commentary recently. He said: ""We all have a collective responsibility to make sure we address the one thing that I know fans would be concerned about when they read the report - and that is, is it safe to go to grounds?"" One person was taken to hospital and four more were injured during the crush at Celtic Park on 2 September last year. The incident happened about 20 minutes before the 12:00 kick-off against Rangers, as Celtic supporters tried to make their way into the stadium. It cameafter stadium access points were changed. Fans also climbed over a wall at the end of a cemetery outside Parkhead Celtic later apologised to fans and said the match was the first occasion which featured new segregation and access arrangements for the Old Firm fixture. Some fans said the new plan resulted in some supporters being forced to climb over a high fence to escape the overcrowding, with one falling from a wall. Speculation arose regarding a gate having been closed on Janefield Street and contributing to the congestion. Police insisted, according to their understanding, the gate was open at all times but would have the issue included in the review. Officers had earlier cordoned off a section of London Road to allow Rangers' 800 fans access, forcing more home supporters than usual to use the Janefield Street entry point. Fans told BBC Scotland how an atmosphere of ""worry and panic"" quickly escalated as hundreds were later caught in a second crush in a corridor under the stadium's North Stand. Police Scotland promised to meet supporters to discuss their concerns following criticism of its operation. Celtic supporter groups called for a thorough investigation. Anticipating the review release, Paul Goodwin, of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association said fans should be told how strict safety checks are at individual grounds. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We deserve the right, as customers, to know what grounds have got issues. ""A lot of this comes back to the overall issues within the game, in terms of governance and transparency. ""Fans don't like to be thought of as customers, but sometimes if you draw it back to that conclusion, we deserve to know what the status of the places were are visiting are."" This video can not be played Celtic apologise after fans crush at Old Firm match The Football Stadium Officers Association (FSOA) said it raised concerns over the ""lack of consistency"" among local authorities over stadium licensing, specifically how safety certificates have been issued. A FSOA spokesperson said: ""We have raised these concerns with the Scottish government, Cosla and the relevant football authorities."" Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) president Alison Evison said the body takes the licensing of stadiums ""very seriously"". She continued: ""We have a strong record of safety on football events activity. We treat our community safety role with high priority. ""Going forward if there are improvements identified of course local government and Cosla will work positively with partners to find solutions."" People helped each other to climb over a wall Publication of the report comes as the government and football authorities continue to debate issues such as coin throwing and sectarianism. Prior to the policing review's completion, Jeanette Findlay, chairwoman of the Celtic Trust, said there was a culture inside the police service in Scotland to treat the fans as though they are ""potential criminals"". She told the BBC: ""The culture is thinking about and planning for games in that way. It's not about thinking, here are a group of citizens who are in a crowd situation and we need to keep them safe."" However earlier this week, Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf saidserious measures were requiredto tackle unacceptable conduct at football matches. Police warn of rise in 'sectarianism and consistently thuggish behaviour' at football Police Scotland look into sectarian singing and coin throwing His remarks followed a series of incidents, including aglass bottle being thrown at Celtic's Scott Sinclair.at a Scottish Cup match against Hibernian and an objectalmost hitting Hearts goalkeeper Zdenek Zlamalduring a clash with Celtic. Last month Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd criticised Celtic fans after beinghit by a coin and subjected to sectarian abusewhile warming up as a substitute during the sides' meeting at Rugby Park. Following the review's publication, SPF vice chairman David Hamilton stressed that he agreed Scottish football has a ""hooliganism problem as well as a sectarian problem"". He said: ""They are both manifestations of the same peculiarity - that some supporter groups believe that criminal behaviour is acceptable at football matches. ""'Fans Against Criminalisation''s refusal to even engage with the review has shown themselves to simply be apologists for this criminality. ""They have refused the opportunity to engage with the review, maintain their entrenched opinions and clearly have no interest in acknowledging yet alone fixing the problems of the Scottish game."" He added: ""This is an important point in Scottish Footballs history and if the review is implemented, should lead to a safer, fairer, more secure and pleasant environment for fans and those responsible for looking after them.""

"This video can not be played Old Firm game: Fans climb fences Five people have been injured trying to get into Sunday's Old Firm game at Celtic Park. One was taken to hospital after falling from a wall and others were treated at the scene before going into the match. Celtic fans said some supporters were forced to climb over a high fence to escape a crush, which they claim was caused by the stadium entry points being changed. Police and Celtic FC said they would be reviewing their procedures. The incident happened about 20 minutes before the 12:00 kick-off as Celtic supporters tried to make their way into the stadium. Police had earlier cordoned off a section of London Road to allow Rangers' 800 fans access, forcing more home supporters than usual to use the Janefield Street entry point. Hundreds of people were then caught in a two-way crush in the corridor under the stadium's North Stand. A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed entry to the area was then temporarily stopped and London Road re-opened in a bid to ease the congestion. One supporter, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Scotland news website: ""People couldn't walk round the stadium anymore so there was a bottleneck under the North Stand. ""Suddenly there was an absolute crush because there were about 1,000 people trying to get one way and about 1,000 trying to go the other way. The corridor is only six to seven people wide."" He added: ""They kept letting people through from either side of the corridor and it became a crush, with people getting semi-trampled. ""I was behind a woman with a boy of about 10 who was getting rocked and people were panicking and climbing over the fences as they couldn't actually breathe properly. It was that bad. ""Myself and my friends were fine but there were women and kids there. It must've been really scary for them."" Fans also climbed over a wall at the end of a cemetery outside Parkhead The Celtic fan said it took him 30-40 minutes to move 300 yards but that the police and club eventually stopped people going in so the situation resolved itself. ""It was an absolute joke,"" he said. ""The people at fault are the police for shutting the access and Celtic for not thinking about how the people flow would go."" One fan described the situation as a ""joke"" Ch Supt Brian McInulty, of Police Scotland, said: ""Five people were treated by first aiders when fans were attempting to get into the stadium in the lead up to kick-off at Janefield Street. ""Four people were treated at the scene and then went into the ground, and the other was taken to hospital after a fall from the wall bordering Janefield Street. ""This was a dynamic situation, occurring 10 minutes before the match started. ""Officers and stewards reacted quickly upon realising there was an issue and put in place measures to relieve the congestion. This included putting in place cordons to prevent further entry at Janefield St and opening up London Road to allow fans to access the stadium from the south."" Ntcham goal inflicts Gerrard's first loss He added: ""We work closely with Celtic Football Club to ensure the safety of all fans attending matches. We plan and practice various scenarios to ensure that if an incident occurs it will be dealt with as quickly as possible, as happened in this case. ""We will review today's incident and work with Celtic to ensure any learning is quickly put in place."" People helped each other to climb over a wall A statement from Celtic Football Club said: ""We are aware of the issues caused by congestion prior to kick-off. We are pleased that stewards and police were able to assist quickly and we thank our supporters for their patience shown while the matter was being dealt with. ""We will work closely with police to investigate and review this matter. The safety of our supporters will always be our priority."" The final score was Celtic 1-0 Rangers.

"A review of policing at football matches in Scotland is due this week Scotland's justice secretary has said serious measures are required to tackle unacceptable conduct at football matches. Humza Yousaf said ""nothing was off the table"" when it came to dealing with sectarianism and violent behaviour. His comments come after a spate of incidents, where items including coins and bottles were thrown or sectarian chanting was heard during matches. A review of policing at football matches in Scotland is due this week. The review, led by South Yorkshire deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, will consider operational planning for matches, intelligence gathering and resource deployment. It comes after a series of incidents, including Saturday night's Scottish Cup match between Celtic and Hibernian wherea glass bottle was thrown at Celtic forward Scott Sinclair. Last week,footage showed an object almost hitting Hearts goalkeeper Zdenek Zlamalduring Wednesday's 2-1 win for Celtic. An independent review of policing at football matches is due to begin this week Last month Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd criticised Celtic fans after beinghit by a coinand subjected to sectarian abuse while warming up as a substitute during the sides' meeting at Rugby Park. The problem, previously termed ""Scotland's shame"", returned to the headlines recently afterKilmarnock manager Steve Clarkehighlighted the abuse he received from Rangers fans. The club's chairmanDave King later apologisedto Clarke and said everyone at Rangers ""abhors the sectarian element that continues to be so prevalent in Scottish football."" Kris Boyd and Steve Clarke have been subjected to recent sectarian abuse The Scottish government said that while the vast majority of football supporters were well-behaved, a problem remained and it was necessary for all those with an influence to enforce a zero-tolerance approach to offensive behaviour. Mr Yousaf said measures, including the idea of strict liability or restrictions imposed on clubs through local authority licensing laws, could be implemented. Under strict liability rules, a club is held responsible for the conduct of its fans. Sanctions include fines, annulment of a match result, the closure of sections of grounds or playing matches behind closed doors. Clubs are ruled by strict liability when competing in European competitions but not domestically, with Scottish Professional Football League members voting overwhelmingly against such a proposal in 2013. Humza Yousaf said: ""When it comes to tackling unacceptable conduct at football, governing bodies and individual clubs must take serious measures to tackle this unacceptable behaviour. ""However, it would be foolish not to also consider what additional action could be taken and we will continue to consider the full range of options, and I will listen to ideas from across the parliamentary chamber, be it Strict Liability or exploring what can be done within current licensing laws, nothing is off the table.â"" Celtic fans abused me like Clarke - McCann Rangers 'abhor' sectarianism - King 'Sectarianism a sad reflection on Scots' Killie's Boyd lambasts Celtic fans Three in court over Celtic game incident 'Culture of denial' over sectarianism Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard in ruins Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"President Putin said foreign intelligence agencies were trying to access Russian technology and data President Vladimir Putin has accused foreign intelligence services of beefing up activities in Russia, announcing that hundreds of spies were stopped in 2018 alone. Without going into details, he said ""129 staff members and 465 agents of foreign special services were foiled"". Russian spies have themselves been accused of several plots, including the poisoning of ex-agent Sergei Skripal. Dutch, Czech and Swedish intelligence all say they have foiled attacks. Russia has also been accused by the West of trying to interfere in elections. Without naming Russia, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, warned on Tuesday that ""anti-European forces"" might try to target EU Parliament elections in May. In his speech to officers of Russia's FSB security service, Mr Putin said their work had to be efficient, especially in protecting data on the development of weapons systems. ""We see foreign intelligence agencies trying to increase their activity towards Russia, seeking by all means to access political, economic, scientific and technological information,"" he said. By Steve Rosenberg, BBC News Moscow It's become something of a Russian tradition. Each year, in late winter or early spring, Vladimir Putin visits Russia's federal security service, the FSB, for a board meeting. And in a speech there, he announces how many foreign agents Russia managed to catch the previous year. It's Moscow's annual scorecard of spying. Judging by the latest figures, espionage is on the up. Four years ago, President Putin revealed that 52 staff members and 290 agents of foreign intelligence agencies had been uncovered in the previous 12 months. The Kremlin's latest catch is 129 and 465. Still, keep in mind three points: We have no way of verifying the figures A Russia swamped with foreign spies neatly fits the Kremlin's current narrative that Russia is a besieged fortress threatened by the West. Plus, high numbers of uncovered agents makes the FSB look good - it suggests the spy catchers are doing their job. Vladimir Putin may claim that ""foreign intelligence agencies are trying to boost their activity in Russia"" but don't forget: Russia spies on the West, too. And Western powers have accused Moscow of trying to extend Russia's own network of foreign agents. After EU leaders agreed with the UK that Russia was highly likely to have been behind the Skripal attack in Salisbury last year, more than 25 countries expelled Russian diplomats. Have Russian spies lost their touch? Austrian colonel 'spied for Russia' How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far The head of the British army, Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, said last year thatRussia was seeking to ""exploit vulnerability and weakness wherever they detect it"".,external Several intelligence agencies have acted against alleged Russian spy networks. CCTV of two suspects in the Skripal attack whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU In December, the Czech Republic said it had broken up a group that used the Russian embassy as cover. Dutch security services said two months earlier that they had foiled a plot to hack the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW. The allegations of spying have all come against a backdrop of a worsening climate between Russia and the US. First the US and then Russia have suspended participation in a Cold War missile treaty. Four Russian cyber warfare suspects named by Dutch officials travelled on diplomatic passports At the weekend deputy defence minister Valery Gerasimov accused the US and its allies of using the ""protest potential of a fifth column"" along with precision weapons as part of a goal of destabilising countries. Last month, Mr Putin said Russia would start developing a new type of medium-range missiles and said they would be aimed at Western capitals, if the West deployed missiles in Europe.

"DUP councillor Graham Craig has been told not to distribute the leaflet. The DUP says a leaflet produced by a councillor for the upcoming elections that cites ""local homes for local people"" was not sanctioned by the party. Graham Craig is a DUP councillor in the Botanic area. BBC News NI has tried to contact Mr Craig for comment but has yet to receive a response. The leaflet also says Mr Craig will focus on ""taking back control of immigration"". But DUP councillor Lee Reynolds said housing and immigration were matters that should be handled sensitively. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Reynolds also said the matter had been referred to party officers. Lee Reynolds is the DUP's Belfast city council group leader. Allow Twitter content?

"There have been protests against fracking activity in the UK New government guidance on fracking is unlawful, the High Court has ruled. Campaign group Talk Fracking argued that the government had not considered the latest scientific evidence when formulating its policy. Ministers have been advising councils that gas from fracking in their area would help combat climate change. But a judge found that the government had failed to consider the latest evidence. Justice Dove ruled that ""material from Talk Fracking, and in particular their scientific evidence as described in their consultation response, was never in fact considered relevant or taken into account"" when formulating the revised policy. He also ruled that the government had unlawfully failed to carry out a lawful public consultation when the policy was revised. The judgment applies to England only. What is fracking? What it's like living next door to a fracking site UK fracking firm urges higher quake limit Claire Stephenson, who brought the claim on behalf of Talk Fracking, said: ""We are delighted that the court has agreed in part with our arguments that the government's policy on fracking is unlawful. ""The government have continually sought to ignore public opinion on fracking, despite the overwhelming opposition on a national level. Planning guidanceissued by the government,externallast year says local councils should ""recognise the benefits of on-shore oil and gas development ... for the security of energy supplies and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy."" It adds that planning authorities should ""put in place policies to facilitate their exploration and extraction."" Following the ruling, a spokeswoman from the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We note the judgment in the case brought by Talk Fracking, and will now consider our next steps."" ""Environmental protections are at the heart of our new planning rulebook, setting clear expectations for future development."" Scottish ministersare expected toset out their finalised policy on fracking in the coming weeks. A moratorium on the process has been in place in Scotland since 2015. Fracking is the process of drilling down into the Earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. Fracking allows drilling firms to access difficult-to-reach resources of oil and gas. The governmentbelievesshale gas has the potential to provide the UK with ""greater energy security, growth and jobs"" and says it ""could be an important part of our transition to a low carbon future"". But campaigners say fracking is distracting energy firms and governments from investing in renewable sources of energy. Talk Fracking argued that ministers had failed to take into account the latest evidence which it said raised doubt over fracking's ""low carbon"" credentials. Rowan Smith, solicitor from Leigh Day representing Talk Fracking, said: ""What is clear from this judgment is that the Government has to keep climate change science under review when formulating fracking policies in an open and transparent way."" By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst It's not clear what happens next on the issue, but it's certainly embarrassing for the government's local government department that put out the advice. And it's another setback for ministers who have watched the popularity of fracking slide in the opinion polls. Fracking in the UK is definitely potentially good for some things: the balance of payments, and tax revenues to the exchequer. It's also a lower-carbon fuel than coal. But this comparison is becoming increasingly irrelevant as coal is driven off the generating system. What is fracking and why is it controversial?

"French supercar maker Bugatti has unveiled the world's most expensive new car, sold to an unnamed buyer for at least $11m (Â£9.5m) before tax. The exact price is not being revealed, but is thought to have overtaken the previous new car record - about Â£8-9m for a Rolls-Royce Sweptail. With engine power about 20 times a Ford Fiesta, the car was built to celebrate Bugatti's 110th anniversary. Ferdinand Piech, grandson of Porsche's founder, is thought to be the buyer. Mr Piech is a former chief executive of Volkswagen, which owns Bugatti. During his tenure, he had a reputation for backing some of the group's most expensive development projects. However, Bugatti would only say that the purchaser was ""an enthusiast of the brand"", which is one of the motor industry's most treasured marques. Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said the La Voiture Noire - The Black Car - combined ""extraordinary technology, aesthetics and extreme luxury"". The car has a jet-black carbon fibre body and a 1,500 horsepower 16-cylinder engine. The Geneva car show is dominated by new electric supercars, but the Bugatti's six exhaust pipes speak to a very different market for power and noise. One motoring journalist said there was something ""Darth Vader about  it"". Bugatti is not saying exactly how fast the car goes. However, the specs are similar to another of Bugatti's astonishing pieces of engineering, the Chiron. This car reaches 62mph in 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 261mph. La Voiture Noire, Bugatti says, pays homage to its Type 57 SC Atlantic. Just four were made between 1936 and 1938, and fashion designer Ralph Lauren is the owner of the last Atlantic produced.

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team A search for two climbers missing after an avalanche on a mountain in Pakistan has been called off, with any hope of finding the men alive now gone. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat, at an altitude of about 6,300m (20,700ft), 10 days ago. Helicopter, drone and ground searches have found no trace of either of the men. Rescue attempts had been delayed due to bad weather and tensions in the region. BBC World Affairs reporter Richard Galpin said it was believed the pair had been hit by a ""huge avalanche"" during the night, the sound of which was apparently heard by villagers miles away, and it ""is now assumed they are dead"".

"Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches New satellite images of North Korea suggest it is restoring a rocket launch site it had pledged to dismantle, say analysts. The images were taken two days after talks between the leaders of the US and North Korea ended without them reaching a deal on denuclearisation. The Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing, never for ballistic missile launches. Work to dismantle it began last year but stopped as the US talks stalled. The pledge to dismantle ithad been seen as a confidence-building measure between Pyongyang and Washington. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Meanwhile, the US has warned North Korea could face yet more sanctions should Pyongyang not take steps to denuclearise. Satellite pictures show the site has been rebuilt The satellite evidence, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appears to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad at the Sohae site at Tongchang-ri. Images last July appeared to show the North had begun to dismantle the site. Sohae has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012. It has also been used for testing engines for missiles capable of reaching the US. But it has never been used for testing the ballistic missiles which have been considered so provocative. ""This distinction is important,"" Jenny Town,managing editor of monitoring group 38 North,external, told the BBC. ""The North Koreans likely see the rebuilding not as an active part of their missile programme, but of their civilian space programme - a distinction they have made repeatedly in the past,"" said Ms Town. She said the rebuilding of structures at the site could signal a lack of trust in the negotiations process. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This is indeed worth watching and the rebuilding work does send a rather ominous signal. But I'm always cautious of extrapolating meaning from satellite images. We cannot make assumptions about what is being discussed in the corridors of power in Pyongyang based on building work at a remote satellite launch station. This renewed activity may be Pyongyang's way of prodding Washington, just a little reminder to the Trump administration that it has the technology to build weapons and it will not give that up easily. Most analysts believe it is more likely, at this stage, that Mr Kim is testing Mr Trump's boundaries and patience, rather than getting ready to test a ballistic missile. If North Korea did go further than rebuilding a rocket test stand, and broke its pledge to stop testing missiles, it would risk the wrath of an unpredictable US president. The impoverished state could be slapped with even more economic sanctions. Mr Kim has sold these denuclearisation talks at home, and is cultivating his statesman-like image abroad - is he really ready to put that all at risk? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended last week in Hanoi without any deal or agreement. A historic first meeting last June in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress. The Hanoi talks were all smiles but little results The two leaders were unable to agree on how far North Korea should progress with denuclearisation before it was granted some sanctions relief. In a television interview on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said North Korea could yet face more sanctions. He said Washington would continue to watch whether Pyongyang was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons programme ""and everything associated with it"". ""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear. They're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact."" Observers, though, warn that adding fresh sanctions could completely stall the peace efforts. ""North Korea always reacts to the imposition of more sanctions in the same way: defiantly,"" Ms Town said. ""Imposing new sanctions now is only going to deflate whatever political will there may be to keep negotiating."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Trump-Kim summit: Who came out on top?

"EOD carried out a controlled explosion Counter terrorism police officers have said the suspect package found at Glasgow University is linked with devices discovered around London. Bomb disposal officers detonated the item after it was found in the mailroom on Wednesday morning. Police Scotland is now ""working closely together"" with officers investigating finds at Heathrow and London City airports and Waterloo station. Staff and students were evacuated from buildings and no-one was injured. Classes were expected to return to normal on Thursday. A controlled explosion took place on a suspect device found at Glasgow University Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. ""Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem. ""Our inquiries into the Glasgow package are at an early stage but there is no ongoing risk to the public."" He added: ""Anyone who sees something suspicious should report it to the police immediately."" University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Suspicious package sees University of Essex evacuated Lectures and tutorials were cancelled and roads cordoned off The university,externalsaid it was acting under advice from Police Scotland as it closed a number of buildings, cancelled classes and sent staff home. The package was discovered just one hour before another suspicious item was discovered at the University of Essex. A 100m cordon was placed around a section of the university whileEssex Police launched an investigation. On Tuesday three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London, the Metropolitan Police said. Scotland Yard said the packages were all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. One caught fire when opened by staff at Heathrow. The airport said it would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". London explosive packages: Police 'can't confirm' Irish terror link A number of police cordons in and around University Avenue in the west end of Glasgow remain in place until further notice. Police made clear, however, there was no ongoing risk to the public. A number of buildings at the University of Glasgow were closed off including the Boyd Orr Building, the mailroom, OTC, Wolfson Medical Building and Bower Building. Others sites that were later closed included the Isabella Elder Building, James McCune Smith Learning Hub, the Joseph Black Building, the Kelvin Building and University Gardens. Classes in these buildings were cancelled with hundreds of students affected. Staff members were later sent home. University Gardens and part of University Avenue were cordoned off by police. However, at about 16:00, the university tweeted that police had advised the incident was ""now over"". The tweet read: ""Minor restrictions will remain in place around the Isabella Elder building and Botany Gate while the Mailroom will remain closed for now. All other buildings are being reopened."" A spokesman confirmed all university buildings, except the mailroom, were operating as normal. Earlier on Wednesday the Royal Bank of Scotland HQ at Gogarburn in Edinburgh was also evacuated after a similar report. However, Police Scotland confirmed that the package posed no risk to the public and contained promotional goods.

"This video can not be played Taj Jackson on Leaving Neverland allegations Sexual abuse allegations made against Michael Jackson by Wade Robson feel like the ""ultimate betrayal"", the singer's nephew says. Taj Jackson says his uncle would be ""crying"" over the allegations made in the Leaving Neverland documentary. Wade and another man, James Safechuck, claim they were abused by the singer when they were children. Taj says the allegations are ""hurtful"" but believes they won't have a lasting effect on the singer's legacy. ""I think it's temporary in terms of the stain. First of all I believe the truth will come out,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""It might take some time. There's been cases when someone has been labelled something and then 10 years later you find out the truth."" Taj Jackson is the son of Michael's brother Tito The Leaving Neverland documentary features the claims by two men that they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck told the BBCthey were abused hundreds of timesfrom the ages of seven and 10. Taj says it's been difficult for the Jackson family as they know Wade and his family really well. He said his uncle would be ""crying"" over the allegations made in the documentary. ""He would've said 'no, not Wade, please not Wade'. But it's happened to him before, people betraying him. ""People that we thought were stand-up people have stolen from him, have sold stories on him."" This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" Taj believes Wade has made the allegations against his uncle because he and James sued the Jackson estate for millions of dollars and the case is up for appeal. ""They can say it's not about money but they are up for appeal and I think if they can get enough backlash or public opinion they're in a good position."" In aninterview with Oprah Winfrey on Monday,external, Wade said his motivation to sue in 2013 wasn't about getting money but was to get a ""powerful platform"" to tell his story. Taj told Newsbeat claims that Michael Jackson is a paedophile is something he's had to deal with for 20 years. He says it's ""hurtful"" the Leaving Neverland documentary might impact on how his uncle is viewed by the public. ""I don't think it's gonna sway the fans but I think it will sway the casual people and that hurts me because they're only seeing one side and they're seeing a one-sided documentary."" TJ Jackson, Taryll Jackson and Taj Jackson released the song Why with their uncle in 1996 Taj admits that he knew young boys slept in Michael Jackson's bed and he was one of those who had sleepovers. ""When you're in his world and you know how pure his heart is and he doesn't even think about those things. ""For him it's not weird but if I'm thinking about someone else then it's different. No-one was like Michael Jackson."" Taj says Michael Jackson's youngest son has been affected ""tremendously"" by abuse claims made against his dad. ""He's 17 and goes to school and he's always been bubbly and talkative in school. ""One of the teachers called to say he's not talking at all and he's not talking to anyone so it's affecting him a lot."" Michael Jackson's three children, Prince, Blanket and Paris, spoke on stage during the 'Michael Forever' concert in 2011 Taj says he's seen the second part of the documentary - which starts on Channel 4 on Wednesday - and says people who don't know Wade and James are likely to find their testimony compelling. ""People who know my uncle are furious right now. I'm talking about ex-employees that got fired from my uncle. They're still coming to his defence because they know the real Michael Jackson. ""It looks very convincing. The director did an incredible job. I'm a director I see the angles, I see the slow motion, the close-ups, the high angles to make them look vulnerable.

"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Counter-terrorism officers say they ""cannot confirm"" any links between Irish dissidents and explosive packages sent to three transport hubs in London. Devices delivered to London City Airport, Heathrow Airport and Waterloo Station on Tuesday all had Republic of Ireland stamps.

"This video can not be played The attack was caught on CCTV inside the Home Bargains store An ""arrogant and selfish"" father has been jailed for 16 years for organising a ""monstrous"" acid attack on his three-year-old son. The boy suffered burns to his face and arms in the attack at the Home Bargains store in Worcester in July last year. Prosecutors said the man, 40, had enlisted others in a bid to ""manufacture"" evidence to discredit his estranged wife during a custody battle. Five other men were jailed at Worcester Crown Court for their part in the plot. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and the five men were found guilty after a six-week trial of plotting to spray sulphuric acid on the boy with intent to harm. A seventh defendant, Martina Badiova, 23, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, was found not guilty of the same charge. Convicted were, clockwise from top left, Jan Dudi, Jabar Paktia, Norbert Pulko, Adam Cech and Saied Hussini Judge Robert Juckes QC, sentencing, told them they had carried out a ""monstrous"" crime with ""obviously strong acid"", probably from a car battery. He said: ""It is an extraordinary thing in this case that not one of you, most of whom have no previous convictions, most of whom with families of your own, at any stage stood back and asked the question of yourself and others: 'what are we doing?'"" The five convicted co-conspirators were: Adam Cech, 27 of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, 25, of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, 22, of Sutherland Road, London Jabar Paktia, 42, of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton Saied Hussini, also 42, of Wrottesley Road, London Hussini, who was said to have tested the strength of the acid on his arm before the attack, was imprisoned for 14 years, while the other four were each jailed for 12 years. Man 'forced to squirt boy, 3, with acid' Acid attack accused 'in surveillance team' Latest news from the West Midlands Following the sentencing, the boy's mother said she ""couldn't sleep for weeks"" after the attack and had ""repeat nightmares about what happened that day"". ""It shocks me to think that people could be involved with doing this to a defenceless child,"" she said. ""It has been extremely hard to accept that my three-year-old child has been attacked in such a way and that his father was behind this. She added: ""How will I explain this to my son?"" The court had heard the father, from Wolverhampton but originally from Afghanistan, was the ""driving force"" behind the attack in the Tallow Hill area on 21 July. His wife left him, taking their three children, in 2016. The trial was told the defendant was seeking greater access to his children and he wanted to create evidence of injuries to show his wife to be an unfit mother after she opposed the application. The boy has made a good recovery following the attack in Tallow Hill area of Worcester Cech, Dudi and Pulko were captured on CCTV at the scene of the attack after following the boy and his mother to the store from their home in a Vauxhall Vectra. Cech approached the child in the shop and squirted acid at him from a small plastic medicine-type bottle, claiming in the trial he had been threatened with a gun to do it. Footage then showed the three men calmly making their escape, Pulko even stopping at the tills to buy two items. After the attack, the boy screamed ""I hurt"" over and over again, jurors were told. He has since made a ""good recovery"" and is living with his mother. Hussini alleged the father - who he had been introduced to by Paktia - had been willing to pay Â£3,000 to carry out the job, and claimed it was Pulko who first suggested using acid. The father had denied knowing Pulko, despite being caught on CCTV ""handing over acid"" to him in a pub car park on the day of the attack. He also claimed to have only hired Hussini and Paktia as ""private investigators"", while Dudi alleged he was just there to watch the mother - and no more. The attack followed what prosecutors claimed had been an ""aborted attack"" at a school eight days earlier. During that incident, Pulko and Hussini were seen by neighbours loitering in the area. Ms Badiova told the court she took part in the ""aborted"" attack believing she was only there to make another man's boyfriend jealous. Supt Damian Pettit of West Mercia Police said: ""This was a horrific attack on an innocent young boy, whose scars will prove a constant reminder of that awful day.""

"Lewis Ludlow is a Muslim convert who used the name Ali Hussain and was nicknamed ""The Eagle"" An Islamic State (IS) supporter who planned to kill 100 people in a ""spectacular"" terror attack in London has been jailed. Lewis Ludlow, 27, from Rochester, Kent, was going to target Oxford Street with a bomb-laden truck after being refused permission to leave the UK. The Old Bailey heard he planned the attack after being told to make the British people ""pay in their blood"". He was sentenced to life imprisonment and will serve a minimum of 13 years. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said he was satisfied that Ludlow was ""engaged in preparations to launch a spectacular multi victim attack"". ""Multiple deaths were risked and very likely to be caused,"" he said. How Oxford Street terror plotter was caught Muslim convert Ludlow, who called himself ""The Eagle"", carried out reconnaissance of central London targets and filmed a pledge of allegiance to IS. Detectives recovered torn-up notes from bins outside his home which listed potential targets, including the Disney Store on Oxford Street, and said as many as 100 people could be killed in an attack using a bomb-laden truck. He had also considered attacking Madame Tussaud's and St Paul's Cathedral. Ludlow carried out reconnaissance of central London targets Sentencing him, Judge Hilliard said Ludlow had ""shown an interest in extremism for a number of years"" which involved a ""deep and genuine attachment to its objectives"". He described him as ""nobody's fool"" and said he was not being forced to do anything by a Philippines-based IS militant, with whom Ludlow was plotting. ""I do not regard you as suggestible or easily taken advantage of, "" he said. ""You were an enthusiastic participant in a joint plan."" He dismissed a claim by Ludlow made during hearings earlier this year that he had disengaged from the terror plot early on. He also said there was no evidence that Ludlow had changed his mindset before being arrested in April last year. The judge said Ludlow's autism and depression did not explain his ""participation in these offences"", and added that his ""adherence to violent Jihad"" was the ""result of free choices made by you"". Ludlow made detailed notes of possible targets in London The former Royal Mail worker, who called himself ""The Ghost"", had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group and was communicating with an IS militant in the Philippines. He had planned to join the group in that country but his passport was revoked, leaving him feeling like ""a trapped animal unable to escape from its cage"". In a video shown in court, Ludlow said: ""I have nothing for this country of Britain. I spit on your citizenship, your passport, you can go to hell with that."" Ludlow said the cancellation of his passport ""literally broke my heart"" and he had then been encouraged by his Filipino contact to carry out a terror attack in the UK instead. Hepleaded guiltyin August to preparing acts of terrorism, but claimed he had abandoned the idea. He also admitted funding IS abroad and was sentenced to a further seven years in prison to run concurrently. Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), said: ""I have no doubt that Ludlow was fully intent on committing a serious violent act."" Update 26 March 2019: This story has been amended following a revision of Ludlow's sentence. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC cut the sentence to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 13 years and two and a half months, down from 15 years. The Old Bailey judge said there had been an error in calculating Ludlow's discount for pleading guilty.

The aircraft was met by emergency services when it landed at Gatwick Airport about 05:25 following an eight-hour flight from Bridgetown in Barbados. Passenger Trevor Wilson said ""a bad chesty cough, possibly a chest infection"" was affecting people. The airline said it was investigating. Thirty people were assessed and treated, two of whom have been taken to hospital. The 448 passengers on the Virgin charter flight were returning from a cruise in the Caribbean, MSC Cruises said. A spokesman for the cruise company said: ""We are still investigating what may have caused the illness and we are currently waiting for further updates from Gatwick Airport medical services. ""What we do know is that on MSC Preziosa, no cases of acute gastroenteritis have been reported in the past 14 days."" Passengers not showing symptoms were allowed to leave the plane. Mr Wilsontweeted,external: ""This flight was exclusively cruise passengers from the MSC Preziosa. The illness seems to have originated on board ship not the plane. Five members of cabin crew became sick on flight."" A spokesman for the airport said emergency staff had taken the ill passengers to an assessment centre for treatment.

"This video can not be played Taj Jackson on Leaving Neverland allegations Sexual abuse allegations made against Michael Jackson by Wade Robson feel like the ""ultimate betrayal"", the singer's nephew says. Taj Jackson says his uncle would be ""crying"" over the allegations made in the Leaving Neverland documentary. Wade and another man, James Safechuck, claim they were abused by the singer when they were children. Taj says the allegations are ""hurtful"" but believes they won't have a lasting effect on the singer's legacy. ""I think it's temporary in terms of the stain. First of all I believe the truth will come out,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""It might take some time. There's been cases when someone has been labelled something and then 10 years later you find out the truth."" Taj Jackson is the son of Michael's brother Tito The Leaving Neverland documentary features the claims by two men that they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck told the BBCthey were abused hundreds of timesfrom the ages of seven and 10. Taj says it's been difficult for the Jackson family as they know Wade and his family really well. He said his uncle would be ""crying"" over the allegations made in the documentary. ""He would've said 'no, not Wade, please not Wade'. But it's happened to him before, people betraying him. ""People that we thought were stand-up people have stolen from him, have sold stories on him."" This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" Taj believes Wade has made the allegations against his uncle because he and James sued the Jackson estate for millions of dollars and the case is up for appeal. ""They can say it's not about money but they are up for appeal and I think if they can get enough backlash or public opinion they're in a good position."" In aninterview with Oprah Winfrey on Monday,external, Wade said his motivation to sue in 2013 wasn't about getting money but was to get a ""powerful platform"" to tell his story. Taj told Newsbeat claims that Michael Jackson is a paedophile is something he's had to deal with for 20 years. He says it's ""hurtful"" the Leaving Neverland documentary might impact on how his uncle is viewed by the public. ""I don't think it's gonna sway the fans but I think it will sway the casual people and that hurts me because they're only seeing one side and they're seeing a one-sided documentary."" TJ Jackson, Taryll Jackson and Taj Jackson released the song Why with their uncle in 1996 Taj admits that he knew young boys slept in Michael Jackson's bed and he was one of those who had sleepovers. ""When you're in his world and you know how pure his heart is and he doesn't even think about those things. ""For him it's not weird but if I'm thinking about someone else then it's different. No-one was like Michael Jackson."" Taj says Michael Jackson's youngest son has been affected ""tremendously"" by abuse claims made against his dad. ""He's 17 and goes to school and he's always been bubbly and talkative in school. ""One of the teachers called to say he's not talking at all and he's not talking to anyone so it's affecting him a lot."" Michael Jackson's three children, Prince, Blanket and Paris, spoke on stage during the 'Michael Forever' concert in 2011 Taj says he's seen the second part of the documentary - which starts on Channel 4 on Wednesday - and says people who don't know Wade and James are likely to find their testimony compelling. ""People who know my uncle are furious right now. I'm talking about ex-employees that got fired from my uncle. They're still coming to his defence because they know the real Michael Jackson. ""It looks very convincing. The director did an incredible job. I'm a director I see the angles, I see the slow motion, the close-ups, the high angles to make them look vulnerable.

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team A search for two climbers missing after an avalanche on a mountain in Pakistan has been called off, with any hope of finding the men alive now gone. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat, at an altitude of about 6,300m (20,700ft), 10 days ago. Helicopter, drone and ground searches have found no trace of either of the men. Rescue attempts had been delayed due to bad weather and tensions in the region. BBC World Affairs reporter Richard Galpin said it was believed the pair had been hit by a ""huge avalanche"" during the night, the sound of which was apparently heard by villagers miles away, and it ""is now assumed they are dead"".

"The late suspect, a landscape gardener, had personal or business relationships with the victims German police are searching for anyone who knew a landscape gardener who may have targeted them by laying booby traps before he died. Bernhard Graumann, 59, was found dead on Friday. Police believe he may be behind an explosive trap that killed a 64-year-old doctor on the same day. Two other people with connections to Graumann were injured by an exploding piece of firewood in their home. Those who think Graumann held a grudge against them should contact the police. Bernhard Graumann, from the small town of Mehlingen in western Germany, died on the night of 1 March at his home. Police are awaiting an autopsy report. Earlier that day, a 64-year-old doctor in the nearby town of Enkenbach-Alsenborn was killed in a deliberate explosion. German police say the unnamed doctor was killed by a booby trap planted at the front door of the doctor's practice, which was apparently triggered when the victim picked a disguised device from the ground. Less than 10km (6 miles) away in Otterberg, there was another explosion on Sunday morning. Police said that a wooden log laced with explosives was placed into a wood-burning stove, exploding and injuring a mother and daughter after it was unknowingly added to the fire. It is assumed that the suspect deliberately placed the booby-trapped log in the home of the victims. Both victims were hospitalised, but neither are in life-threatening condition. ""The investigation of the criminal police showed that in both cases Bernhard Graumann is suspicious,"" police said in a statement. ""He had a personal or business connection with the victims,"" police said, adding he ""did not have a good relationship"" with them. ""In both cases, there had been conflicts in the past."" A search of Graumann's home resulted in the discovery of gunpowder and ""other items"" covered by explosive regulations. Crucially, police said they could not rule out that more traps had been prepared by the gardener before his death, which could put other people's lives in danger. German media report that Graumann was known to be a member of a local medieval association which apparently included, among other activities, recreating antique firearms that use gunpowder. ""People who have had a problematic private or business relationship with Graumann are urged to contact the police immediately,"" the police said. A special phone line has received dozens of calls, they said.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers. ""We've agreed that by the end of the week we'll set out the scale of the investment required,"" she said.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces.""

Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now.

Her official spokesman said the Home Office would co-ordinate an urgent series of ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work government was doing to support local councils and police. Mrs May said the problem would require ""a whole-of-government effort, in conjunction with the police, the wider public sector and local communities"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the prime minister for saying there was no direct link between the cut in police numbers and the increase in violent crime.

But Donna Murray-Turner, who chairs the Croydon Safer Neighbourhood Board, does not believe more police officers will solve the issue.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Prime Minister Theresa May has not listened to police concerns about knife crime, a former head of the Metropolitan Police has said. Mrs May said the deaths of young people were ""appalling"" as she announced an upcoming summit on knife crime. But Lord Stevens told the BBC: ""I don't think she listens, quite frankly, to what she's being told."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was not doing enough to tackle the root causes of knife crime. Senior party members, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan and shadow policing minister Louise Haigh,have written to the PM calling for 10,000 new police officers,externalto help tackle youth violence. 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'I lost my son to knife crime - here's my advice' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives On Wednesday afternoon a man, believed to be in his mid-20s,was fatally stabbed in Leyton, east London, police said. The Met said it had launched a murder investigation and no arrests had been made. Earlier, Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for knife crime to betreated ""like a disease"", and said ""we have to listen to them [police] when they talk about resources"". The most awful political truth about the flare in knife crime is that it is so familiar. From time to time, a flurry of terrible attacks emerges, the public is alarmed and politicians debate what can be done. Frankly then, many of the solutions that are often put forward are familiar too. And for a time, genuinely trying to focus on this kind of violence is a prominent political priority. But also familiar is the narrative where that focus then fades over time and the political grip is loosened. What's difficult for politicians grappling with it this time round is not just that the real solutions might take a long time to pursue and make real - that's a familiar truth. Read more Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Lord Stevens - who was commissioner of the Met between 2000 and 2005 - criticised Mrs May's handling of crime and policing as PM and when she was home secretary. He said the Home Office had not been listening for the past five or six years. ""All you got from the Home Office, and in particular the home secretary at the time, now the prime minister, was 'our reforms are working'. ""She hasn't listened to what's been going on and it's not good enough."" Lord Stevens said he thought Mr Javid was the right person to see the crisis through and called for him to chair the upcoming summit on knife crime at 10 Downing Street. ""He's got the personality, he's got the empathy. He understands the difficulties on the streets and he understands the difficulties the police are facing."" The issue of knife crime was debated by Mrs May and Mr Corbynduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mrs May began PMQs by saying any deaths through violence were an ""appalling tragedy"" and young people were dying in a ""growing cycle of violence that has shocked us all"". The prime minister said she would hold a summit in No 10 in the coming days with ministers, community leaders and victims to explore what can be done. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of not doing enough to tackle the ""root cause"" of the rise in knife crime and of trying to keep communities ""safe on the cheap"". He said 285 people were stabbed to death last year in England and Wales - the ""highest level ever"" - before asking if she regretted ""cuts in police numbers"". Mrs May replied: ""We are putting more resources into the police this year - it's no good members on the opposition benches standing up and saying 'no you're not', it's a fact more money is being put into the police this year, that more money is being put into the police next year."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Theresa May served as home secretary for six years when forces in England and Wales faced deep budget cuts and - on her instructions - drastically reduced the use of stop-and-search. That is why claims that a shortage of police resources and fewer searches have contributed to the surge in serious violence appear to be so uncomfortable for her. If correct, it would mean her policies were in some way responsible. In contrast, the current incumbent, Sajid Javid - whose brother is a chief superintendent in West Midlands Police - has no prior record at the Home Office to defend. He won over officers at his first Police Federation conference - where Mrs May had once been booed and jeered - by promising more resources and backing the use of stop and search. After today's meeting, he repeatedly said how important it was to ""listen"" to the police - a coded message to his boss, if ever there was one. Earlier, Mr Javid met police chiefs from the seven forces in England and Wales most affected by violent crime, during which funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed. The UK's top police officer, Cressida Dick,said there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbersin England and Wales after Mrs May had previously insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". Asked for his view, Mr Javid said: ""I think police resources are very important to deal with this. We've got to do everything we can. ""I'm absolutely committed to working with the police in doing this. We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease, and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" The former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, told the BBC the police need to feel supported over the use of stop and search. In 2014, Mrs Mayrestricted the use of the tacticas home secretary, arguing that it undermined public confidence in the police when it was misused. But Mr Johnson said: ""What the police want to hear is this is something that is actively supported, and they'll be backed up in showing real determination in cracking down.""

"French supercar maker Bugatti has unveiled the world's most expensive new car, sold to an unnamed buyer for at least $11m (Â£9.5m) before tax. The exact price is not being revealed, but is thought to have overtaken the previous new car record - about Â£8-9m for a Rolls-Royce Sweptail. With engine power about 20 times a Ford Fiesta, the car was built to celebrate Bugatti's 110th anniversary. Ferdinand Piech, grandson of Porsche's founder, is thought to be the buyer. Mr Piech is a former chief executive of Volkswagen, which owns Bugatti. During his tenure, he had a reputation for backing some of the group's most expensive development projects. However, Bugatti would only say that the purchaser was ""an enthusiast of the brand"", which is one of the motor industry's most treasured marques. Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said the La Voiture Noire - The Black Car - combined ""extraordinary technology, aesthetics and extreme luxury"". The car has a jet-black carbon fibre body and a 1,500 horsepower 16-cylinder engine. The Geneva car show is dominated by new electric supercars, but the Bugatti's six exhaust pipes speak to a very different market for power and noise. One motoring journalist said there was something ""Darth Vader about  it"". Bugatti is not saying exactly how fast the car goes. However, the specs are similar to another of Bugatti's astonishing pieces of engineering, the Chiron. This car reaches 62mph in 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 261mph. La Voiture Noire, Bugatti says, pays homage to its Type 57 SC Atlantic. Just four were made between 1936 and 1938, and fashion designer Ralph Lauren is the owner of the last Atlantic produced.

"The US trade gap with the rest of the world jumped to a 10-year high of $621bn (Â£472.5bn) last year, dealing a blow to President Donald Trump's deficit reduction plan. The trade deficit is the difference between how much goods and services the US imports from other countries and how much it exports. Reducing the gap is a key plank of Mr Trump's policies. But in 2018, the US exported fewer goods compared with how much it bought. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Mr Trump claims that the US is being ""ripped off"" by other nations and wants countries to lower their tariffs on US goods and buy more of them. However, official data shows that while exports of US goods and services rose by $148.9bn last year, imports jumped by $217.7bn. It means that the gap is the widest since 2008, when the global financial crisis hit and the US fell into recession. The deficit in goods and services during December also hit a near 10-year high of $59.8bn. Exports to the rest of the world fell 1.9% to $205.1bn, while imports rose by 2.1% to $264.9bn. The US is currently locked in a trade battle with China over what it claims are unfair trade practices, resulting in tit-for-tat tariff increases on each others' goods. Allow Twitter content?

Both nations are in discussions and there is speculation they could reach an agreement by the end of March. New data shows that the trade gap between the US and China widened last year by $43.6bn to $419.2bn as exports of American products and services fell, but imports from China rose. It was one of Donald Trump's signature campaign promises. Back in June 2016, he stood before a large crowd in Monessen, Pennsylvania and said that as President, he would reduce America's ballooning trade deficit. He called it ""a political and politician-made disaster"" and said ""it can be corrected"". Only it hasn't exactly turned out that way. Last year, Mr Trump introduced tariffs on steel and aluminium from around the globe and on a range of imports from China. The idea was that the tariffs would make imports more expensive, thereby discouraging Americans from buying foreign goods and services and shrinking the trade deficit. But the opposite has happened. Instead, Donald Trump goes into the presidential re-election race having failed to deliver on his campaign promise to close the US trade deficit. Part of the problem is Mr Trump's own tax policies. They boosted US consumption and a lot of that spending went abroad. This happened as growth was slowing in other parts of the world, contributing to a rising dollar. That made US exports more expensive and less competitive. Of course, an economic downturn would help reduce the trade deficit. But who wants that? Mr Trump warned in December that if the two countries failed to reach an agreement on trade, he would take action, dubbing himself ""a Tariff Man"". The deficit between the US and the European Union also increased in 2018, up by $17.9bn to $169.3bn. Following the same trend as with China, US export growth to the EU was eclipsed by imports of European goods and services to America, which last year rose to $487.9bn. Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker reached a truce on trade last year Followinga spat between the US and the EUwhen America lifted tariffs on steel and aluminium, Mr Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year reached a truce. However, Mr Trump may choose to lift tariffs on European cars and parts after the US Commerce Department produced a report examining whether the imports threaten national security. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom are meeting on Wednesday in Washington, where the issue of allowing America's agriculture industry access to Europe is expected to be discussed.

"Washington's ambassador to the UK has defended the US's approach to food hygiene and farming. Criticism of US food standards was ""designed to reduce not increase trade"", Woody Johnson told the BBC. US beef and chicken producers use processes not permitted in the EU, including rinsing chicken carcasses with chlorine. But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries.

Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said. He said 90% of American farms were owned by families and cited his own mother, who he said continued to drive a tractor on the family's organic farm into her 90s. He added that he had confidence that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK would continue. ""Our relationship is more important than ever,"" he said.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament Summing up the debate on 70 years of the Commonwealth, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says it is ""a remarkable organisation with a remarkable reach"". She says moves must be made towards a fairer, more stable and prosperous Commonwealth, but that great progress is being made. ""We must ensure a modern Commonwealth can meet future challenges - from climate change to cyber attacks,"" she says. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament MPs are now on to the second backbench debate of the day on the opportunities and challenges facing the modern Commonwealth in its 70th year. The debate is led by Conservative MP James Duddridge and can continue until 5pm. Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Jess Phillips, as she has done in previous years, reads out the names of the women who have been killed by men in the past year, as recorded by the Counting Dead Women project. The Labour MP says these women are no longer here because ""they are hard to see, hard to hear and hard to believe"". After finishing reading out the list - which takes nearly seven minutes - Ms Phillips tells MPs: ""These women needs us, in this place, to hear their names and hear their stories."" Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Maria Miller is now opening the backbench debate on International Women's Day, which is celebrated tomorrow. 100 years ago Nancy Astor was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, Ms Miller says. The gender pay gap for women under 30 has all but disappeared she says, adding that great progress has been made with companies now forced to publish their gender pay gap: ""The issue is on the agenda"". But, she continues, ""there has not been enough progress at all"", and ""discrimination is still blatant."" Just one in three MPs are women, Ms Miller says, adding that this ""must be improved"". Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says the most important sentence in the report is that the Home Office has reviewed 11,800 Caribbean cases, but that around 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases were excluded. She asks Ms Hillier if she agrees that these large numbers of people cannot be ignored. Public Accounts Committee Chair Meg Hillier says the government must ""get a grip on this"", and that it is absolutely right that all those affected should receive support. ""It is very important that the government deals with this more effectively,"" she adds. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier says the Home Office ""failed to understand the real life impacts"" that it was implementing. The government created ""huge problems"" for people by changing the rules, but were ""seemingly unaware"", she says, adding that the Home Office was warned about these problems and their potential impacts in 2014. ""Some people went on holiday to be told they could never come back,"" Ms Hillier adds. The government's Windrush Scheme ""has not helped everybody as it should have done"", she says. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush MPs are now hearing a statement on the Commons Public Accounts Committee's (PAC) report on Windrush and the Home Office. The report says the Home Office had failed to ""take ownership"" of problems it had created. It also accused the department of  ""complacency"" and shirking its responsibility in response to theWindrush scandal. The committee of MPs further criticised a decision to exclude up to 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases from a review carried out to identify how many people may have been affected. The Windrush scandal involved wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs"" experienced.

Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes calls for the prosecution of the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist group, Masood Azhar. ""Both sides have a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric, de-escalate the tension and avoid taking any further military action which could inflame the situation further,"" she says. A major incident will occur from which there will be no going back, Ms McInnes adds, calling for ""immediate talks to prevent further military action"".

The situation ""remains fragile"", and both militaries remain on heightened alert, he adds. ""The situation could move quickly back into crisis"", Mr Field says, noting reports that a deadly grenade attack was carried out this morning. The captured Indian Wing Commander being reunited with his family ""is an important and welcome step by Pakistan to reduce tensions"", he adds. He calls on both countries to find a diplomatic solution to resolve the conflict and to ensure longer term regional stability in Kashmir. The UK ""stands ready to support discussions"" between the two countries, he adds, but notes that it is ""not for the UK to supply a solution or act as a mediator"". Foreign Office Minister Mark Field is now delivering a statement on Kashmir. Yesterday it was announced thatPakistan has detained dozens of suspected militantsfollowing an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which sparked a crisis with India. They include the brother and another relative of Masood Azhar, the founder of the group that claimed the attack. The latest tensions began to unfold on 14 February when asuicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian soldiersin Indian-administered Kashmir.

"French supercar maker Bugatti has unveiled the world's most expensive new car, sold to an unnamed buyer for at least $11m (Â£9.5m) before tax. The exact price is not being revealed, but is thought to have overtaken the previous new car record - about Â£8-9m for a Rolls-Royce Sweptail. With engine power about 20 times a Ford Fiesta, the car was built to celebrate Bugatti's 110th anniversary. Ferdinand Piech, grandson of Porsche's founder, is thought to be the buyer. Mr Piech is a former chief executive of Volkswagen, which owns Bugatti. During his tenure, he had a reputation for backing some of the group's most expensive development projects. However, Bugatti would only say that the purchaser was ""an enthusiast of the brand"", which is one of the motor industry's most treasured marques. Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann said the La Voiture Noire - The Black Car - combined ""extraordinary technology, aesthetics and extreme luxury"". The car has a jet-black carbon fibre body and a 1,500 horsepower 16-cylinder engine. The Geneva car show is dominated by new electric supercars, but the Bugatti's six exhaust pipes speak to a very different market for power and noise. One motoring journalist said there was something ""Darth Vader about  it"". Bugatti is not saying exactly how fast the car goes. However, the specs are similar to another of Bugatti's astonishing pieces of engineering, the Chiron. This car reaches 62mph in 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 261mph. La Voiture Noire, Bugatti says, pays homage to its Type 57 SC Atlantic. Just four were made between 1936 and 1938, and fashion designer Ralph Lauren is the owner of the last Atlantic produced.

"This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Victims' families have called for the Northern Ireland secretary to resign over comments she made about the Troubles. Karen Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were ""not crimes"". She later clarified that ""where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated"". John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". ""Her place now is untenable - she should go,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said the secretary of state should resign. ""What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father - 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body - that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way. ""For Mrs Bradley to come out with insulting, despicable insults to families, it's an absolute disgrace."" Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney met Mrs Bradley in London on Wednesday evening, during which he intended to discuss her comments. ""The position of the Irish Government is clear,"" his department said. ""There should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.""

Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley was responding to a question from DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly about legacy issues. ""Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists, every single one of those was a crime,"" she said. ""The fewer than 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. ""They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also called for Mrs Bradley's resignation. In a tweet, Mr Eastwood wrote: ""Karen Bradley is publically interfering with the rule of law. No-one has the right to deliberately pressure or intervene with due process. She should resign."" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neilltweeted,external: ""These comments are an insult to families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the British army, state agencies and their proxies in the loyalist death squads which were directed by the British state. ""These offensive and hurtful comments should be withdrawn immediately."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there should not be a one-sided approach to dealing with the past. ""We have been involved in discussions with the government to support our veterans, against the witch hunts against them,"" he said. ""However no-one should be above the law and all innocent victims deserve justice."" Later on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley returned to the chamber to clarify her comments. ""The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, and integrity and within the law,"" she said. ""I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible. ""These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities who are independent of government."" The son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane, John Finucane,tweeted that her original comments were ""indefensible"",external. ""Legally, politically and morally indefensible, yet is it really surprising to hear a [secretary of state] publicly express the contempt we know the British [government] had for lives here?"" Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Pat Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught in a 2012 review of the murder proposed by the then prime minister David Cameron. Mark Thompson, from victims' organisation Relatives for Justice, said: ""It is absolutely odious and reprehensible that they would stand up and say killings by the state are justified and that they are legitimate."" Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport The latest comments from Karen Bradley come at a particularly sensitive time, asan announcement is expected soon on whether any prosecutions will be brought in relation to the infamous Bloody Sunday killings. Campaigners for victims of state violence in Northern Ireland were quick to slam the secretary of state's comment that the security forces involved in killings were ""fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way"". Perhaps Mrs Bradley meant to use those words about soldiers and police officers who were found to have acted within the army's rules of engagement, but as she delivered her remarks in the Commons she appeared to be granting absolution to all security force personnel regardless of the circumstances. Whatever the case, there's no doubt that as the Bloody Sunday announcement draws closer, the government is under pressure from many of its own backbenchers and DUP MPs angered over what they regard as a ""witch hunt"" directed at military veterans. Less than an hour after Mrs Bradley spoke, Theresa May was on her feet dealing with the same issue, and confirming that the Ministry of Defence is considering potential legislation designed to ensure - in the prime minister's words that ""service personnel are not unfairly pursued through the courts"". However as those proposals are drawn up, you can expect they will provoke renewed controversy on either side of the debate over Northern Ireland's troubled past. Last year, Theresa May saidthe system for investigating the past in Northern Ireland was ""unfair"". The prime minister said only people in the ""armed forces"" or ""law enforcement"" were being investigated. However, in 2017, figures obtained by the BBC challenged claims thatTroubles investigations unduly focused on those committed by the Army.

""One summit is just not enough,"" she says, adding there should be ""weekly meetings"" on the issue either within the Home Office or Cobra, the government's emergency committee. Victoria Atkins says the government is working with police crime commissioners to reach vulnerable people who need help, and is putting money into new initiatives. ""There is more that we as a society can do to say it is not normal to carry knives,"" she says, but notes that the issue is ""complex"". Urgent question on knife crime House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says ""this is not a few newspaper stories, this is people's lives."" On the issue of police numbers, Ms Abbott says ""it is not just front line police officers, it is the need for community police officers"". She asks Ms Atkins if she agrees with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick that ""there is a clear correlation between the fall in police numbers and the rise in violent crime"".

"Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 and another died of his injuries some months later The sister of a man killed on Bloody Sunday has described a former soldier's comments on the shootings as ""very cold and very brutal"". Thirteen people died on the day and 15 were injured after troops opened fire in Londonderry in January 1972. The former paratrooper told the BBC thathe feels no guilt for what happened. He said he still considers it a job well done. Bloody Sunday: Tense wait for soldier prosecution decision Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report The man known as Sergeant 'O' is one of a number of ex-soldiers who will find out next week if they will be prosecuted over the killings The Saville Inquiry into the killings concluded that all the victims were innocent. Speaking to the BBC's Peter Taylor, Sergeant 'O' said that Lord Saville was not there on the day and whilst he accepted that some of those who were killed were innocent he did not accept that all of the victims were innocent. Kate Nash, whose 19-year-old brother William was shot dead described the soldier's comments as cold and as a lie. ""What a horrible lie to continue to stand by, even as you become an older person. ""Very cold and very brutal."" Eighteen ex-paratroopershave been reported to the PPSover the killings and the Bloody Sunday victims are currently waiting to hear if any will face charges. Michael McDaid, William Nash, John Young were killed on Bloody Sunday Lord Saville's official inquiry into the killings concluded that all victims were innocent and posed no threat. The paratroopers, he said, lost their self-control and fired without discipline. His unequivocal conclusion led the then prime minister, David Cameron, to deliver a historic apology in the House of Commons and to the people of Derry. What happened on Bloody Sunday, he said, was ""unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation following the report. The BBC previously obtained a letter from a senior public prosecutor detailing the criminal charges the soldiers could face. They include murder and attempted murder, wounding, perjury and joint enterprise, which means an offence where two or more people are involved.

"Michel Barnier is leading Brexit talks on behalf of the European Commission Brexit negotiations ""have been difficult"" and ""no solution has been identified"" to the Irish backstop, the European Commission has said. It comes after the latest talks between UK ministers and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the talks had taken place in a ""constructive atmosphere"" but there had been no breakthrough. The UK is pushing for legally-binding changes to the EU deal. Brexit vote offer to MPs on workers' rights Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? Brexit: A really simple guide Mr Schinas was speaking after Mr Barnier briefed the European Commission's weekly meeting on the state of Brexit talks. Speaking after talks with Mr Barnier, the UK's Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" This video can not be played Liam Fox says leaving the EU without a deal would be ""hugely sub-optimal, compared to getting a deal"". This video can not be played Steve Brine:  ""The idea of some sort of clean break...is utter nonsense."" Downing Street echoed Mr Barnier's characterisation of the talks as ""difficult"", but said the negotiations were ""ongoing"". ""The EU continues to say that it wants this to be resolved and that it wants the UK to leave with a deal. Parliament has been clear that for this to happen, we require legally-binding changes which mean that the UK can't be trapped in the backstop indefinitely,"" said the PM's official spokesman. ""That is what we will continue to pursue."" The backstop is an insurance policy - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Prime Minister Theresa May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to it that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. She believes this would be enough to get MPs - who last month rejected her deal by an historic margin - to back her deal in a vote she has promised on or before 12 March. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the EU has consistently refused to rewrite the deal it has struck with Mrs May, which is meant to ensure an orderly departure from the bloc on 29 March and pave the way for trade talks. And Mr Barnier repeated that message to EU leaders, according to Mr Schinas. ""Discussions have been difficult and no solution has been identified to that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol which, as you know, will not be reopened,"" he said at a press conference in Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming explained that EU sources said the UK side couldn't guarantee that whatever might end up being agreed in Brussels would even get through Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn is meeting Tory MPs to discuss a Norway-style Brexit Mrs May is also hoping to attract votes from Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas of the UK, as she battles to get her deal through the Commons. She is promising MPs a vote on anychanges to workers' rightsafter Brexit. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button But trade unions said the MPs should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"" and the assurances on workers' rights were ""not worth the paper they are written on"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has met Conservative MPs who back a close, Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. He discussed the idea of a ""Common Market 2.0"" trade-focused model with former ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin. Mr Boles said the goal was to reach a cross-party compromise to ensure the UK left the EU but in a manner which protected its economic interests. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The attack was caught on CCTV inside the Home Bargains store An ""arrogant and selfish"" father has been jailed for 16 years for organising a ""monstrous"" acid attack on his three-year-old son. The boy suffered burns to his face and arms in the attack at the Home Bargains store in Worcester in July last year. Prosecutors said the man, 40, had enlisted others in a bid to ""manufacture"" evidence to discredit his estranged wife during a custody battle. Five other men were jailed at Worcester Crown Court for their part in the plot. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and the five men were found guilty after a six-week trial of plotting to spray sulphuric acid on the boy with intent to harm. A seventh defendant, Martina Badiova, 23, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, was found not guilty of the same charge. Convicted were, clockwise from top left, Jan Dudi, Jabar Paktia, Norbert Pulko, Adam Cech and Saied Hussini Judge Robert Juckes QC, sentencing, told them they had carried out a ""monstrous"" crime with ""obviously strong acid"", probably from a car battery. He said: ""It is an extraordinary thing in this case that not one of you, most of whom have no previous convictions, most of whom with families of your own, at any stage stood back and asked the question of yourself and others: 'what are we doing?'"" The five convicted co-conspirators were: Adam Cech, 27 of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, 25, of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, 22, of Sutherland Road, London Jabar Paktia, 42, of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton Saied Hussini, also 42, of Wrottesley Road, London Hussini, who was said to have tested the strength of the acid on his arm before the attack, was imprisoned for 14 years, while the other four were each jailed for 12 years. Man 'forced to squirt boy, 3, with acid' Acid attack accused 'in surveillance team' Latest news from the West Midlands Following the sentencing, the boy's mother said she ""couldn't sleep for weeks"" after the attack and had ""repeat nightmares about what happened that day"". ""It shocks me to think that people could be involved with doing this to a defenceless child,"" she said. ""It has been extremely hard to accept that my three-year-old child has been attacked in such a way and that his father was behind this. She added: ""How will I explain this to my son?"" The court had heard the father, from Wolverhampton but originally from Afghanistan, was the ""driving force"" behind the attack in the Tallow Hill area on 21 July. His wife left him, taking their three children, in 2016. The trial was told the defendant was seeking greater access to his children and he wanted to create evidence of injuries to show his wife to be an unfit mother after she opposed the application. The boy has made a good recovery following the attack in Tallow Hill area of Worcester Cech, Dudi and Pulko were captured on CCTV at the scene of the attack after following the boy and his mother to the store from their home in a Vauxhall Vectra. Cech approached the child in the shop and squirted acid at him from a small plastic medicine-type bottle, claiming in the trial he had been threatened with a gun to do it. Footage then showed the three men calmly making their escape, Pulko even stopping at the tills to buy two items. After the attack, the boy screamed ""I hurt"" over and over again, jurors were told. He has since made a ""good recovery"" and is living with his mother. Hussini alleged the father - who he had been introduced to by Paktia - had been willing to pay Â£3,000 to carry out the job, and claimed it was Pulko who first suggested using acid. The father had denied knowing Pulko, despite being caught on CCTV ""handing over acid"" to him in a pub car park on the day of the attack. He also claimed to have only hired Hussini and Paktia as ""private investigators"", while Dudi alleged he was just there to watch the mother - and no more. The attack followed what prosecutors claimed had been an ""aborted attack"" at a school eight days earlier. During that incident, Pulko and Hussini were seen by neighbours loitering in the area. Ms Badiova told the court she took part in the ""aborted"" attack believing she was only there to make another man's boyfriend jealous. Supt Damian Pettit of West Mercia Police said: ""This was a horrific attack on an innocent young boy, whose scars will prove a constant reminder of that awful day.""

"Passengers were taken ill on a flight from Barbados to London Gatwick Passengers and crew on a Virgin Atlantic flight were put into quarantine due to widespread sickness on board the plane. The aircraft was met by emergency services when it landed at Gatwick Airport about 05:25 following an eight-hour flight from Bridgetown in Barbados. Passenger Trevor Wilson said ""a bad chesty cough, possibly a chest infection"" was affecting people. The airline said it was investigating. Thirty people were assessed and treated, two of whom have been taken to hospital. The 448 passengers on the Virgin charter flight were returning from a cruise in the Caribbean, MSC Cruises said. A spokesman for the cruise company said: ""We are still investigating what may have caused the illness and we are currently waiting for further updates from Gatwick Airport medical services. ""What we do know is that on MSC Preziosa, no cases of acute gastroenteritis have been reported in the past 14 days."" Passengers not showing symptoms were allowed to leave the plane. Mr Wilsontweeted,external: ""This flight was exclusively cruise passengers from the MSC Preziosa. The illness seems to have originated on board ship not the plane. Five members of cabin crew became sick on flight."" A spokesman for the airport said emergency staff had taken the ill passengers to an assessment centre for treatment.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? It comes after two 17-year-olds were killed in separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now.

Mrs May said the problem would require ""a whole-of-government effort, in conjunction with the police, the wider public sector and local communities"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the prime minister for saying there was no direct link between the cut in police numbers and the increase in violent crime.

Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Jess Phillips, as she has done in previous years, reads out the names of the women who have been killed by men in the past year, as recorded by the Counting Dead Women project. The Labour MP says these women are no longer here because ""they are hard to see, hard to hear and hard to believe"". After finishing reading out the list - which takes nearly seven minutes - Ms Phillips tells MPs: ""These women needs us, in this place, to hear their names and hear their stories.""

The gender pay gap for women under 30 has all but disappeared she says, adding that great progress has been made with companies now forced to publish their gender pay gap: ""The issue is on the agenda"". But, she continues, ""there has not been enough progress at all"", and ""discrimination is still blatant."" Just one in three MPs are women, Ms Miller says, adding that this ""must be improved"". Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says the most important sentence in the report is that the Home Office has reviewed 11,800 Caribbean cases, but that around 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases were excluded.

Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes calls for the prosecution of the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist group, Masood Azhar. ""Both sides have a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric, de-escalate the tension and avoid taking any further military action which could inflame the situation further,"" she says. A major incident will occur from which there will be no going back, Ms McInnes adds, calling for ""immediate talks to prevent further military action"". It is time to break the cycle of children growing up surrounded by conflict and in fear, she concludes, adding: ""peace and stability must be brought to the people of Kashmir."" Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says there has been a ""welcome pause"" in the escalation of tensions, but the government remains ""deeply concerned"". The situation ""remains fragile"", and both militaries remain on heightened alert, he adds. ""The situation could move quickly back into crisis"", Mr Field says, noting reports that a deadly grenade attack was carried out this morning. The captured Indian Wing Commander being reunited with his family ""is an important and welcome step by Pakistan to reduce tensions"", he adds. He calls on both countries to find a diplomatic solution to resolve the conflict and to ensure longer term regional stability in Kashmir. The UK ""stands ready to support discussions"" between the two countries, he adds, but notes that it is ""not for the UK to supply a solution or act as a mediator"". Foreign Office Minister Mark Field is now delivering a statement on Kashmir. Yesterday it was announced thatPakistan has detained dozens of suspected militantsfollowing an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which sparked a crisis with India. They include the brother and another relative of Masood Azhar, the founder of the group that claimed the attack. The latest tensions began to unfold on 14 February when asuicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian soldiersin Indian-administered Kashmir. Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) said it carried out the attack, and on 26 February, India retaliated by carrying outair strikeson what it said was a JeM militant camp in Pakistan. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to respond and the day after the strike, a dogfight between the sides led to anIndian fighter jet being shot downin Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

"Reports that Will Smith is tipped to play Richard Williams have sparked accusations of colourism An upcoming biopic about the father of Serena and Venus Williams has faced criticism amid reports that Will Smith will play the lead role. Richard Williams, 77, coached his daughters to become two of the world's greatest tennis players, despite having no previous experience of the game. But Smith's reported casting in the film has angered critics, who say he is too light-skinned for the part. The actor has not yet commented on the reported casting or the criticism. Colourism is a form of discrimination against dark-skinned people in favour of those with lighter skin from the same race. Richard Williams coached his daughters to the top of the game It can lead to a lack of representation in film, TV and fashion, particularly in Hollywoodand Bollywood, as well as discrimination at work or on dating sites, and evento serious health problems from skin bleaching creams. This video can not be played Colourism: ""There's not just one way of being beautiful"" Do light-skinned black celebs have it easier? 'Colourism is big in the Asian community' British film No Shade tackles colourism and dating Smith's casting in the film has not been confirmed. However, aftera report from Deadline News,externalclaimed that the 50-year-old actor was ""poised to play"" Mr Williams, many people expressed their anger on social media. The criticism stems from the fact that Smith is significantly lighter than Mr Williams. US-based sports writer Clarence Hill Jr tweeted that ""colourism matters"", and said that Smith wasn't the right choice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Victims' families have called for the Northern Ireland secretary to resign over comments she made about the Troubles. Karen Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were ""not crimes"". She later clarified that ""where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated"". John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". ""Her place now is untenable - she should go,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said the secretary of state should resign. ""What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father - 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body - that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way. ""For Mrs Bradley to come out with insulting, despicable insults to families, it's an absolute disgrace."" Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney met Mrs Bradley in London on Wednesday evening, during which he intended to discuss her comments. ""The position of the Irish Government is clear,"" his department said. ""There should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.""

Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley was responding to a question from DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly about legacy issues. ""Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists, every single one of those was a crime,"" she said. ""The fewer than 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. ""They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also called for Mrs Bradley's resignation. In a tweet, Mr Eastwood wrote: ""Karen Bradley is publically interfering with the rule of law. No-one has the right to deliberately pressure or intervene with due process. She should resign."" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neilltweeted,external: ""These comments are an insult to families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the British army, state agencies and their proxies in the loyalist death squads which were directed by the British state. ""These offensive and hurtful comments should be withdrawn immediately."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there should not be a one-sided approach to dealing with the past. ""We have been involved in discussions with the government to support our veterans, against the witch hunts against them,"" he said. ""However no-one should be above the law and all innocent victims deserve justice."" Later on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley returned to the chamber to clarify her comments. ""The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, and integrity and within the law,"" she said. ""I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible. ""These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities who are independent of government."" The son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane, John Finucane,tweeted that her original comments were ""indefensible"",external. ""Legally, politically and morally indefensible, yet is it really surprising to hear a [secretary of state] publicly express the contempt we know the British [government] had for lives here?"" Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Pat Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught in a 2012 review of the murder proposed by the then prime minister David Cameron. Mark Thompson, from victims' organisation Relatives for Justice, said: ""It is absolutely odious and reprehensible that they would stand up and say killings by the state are justified and that they are legitimate."" Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport The latest comments from Karen Bradley come at a particularly sensitive time, asan announcement is expected soon on whether any prosecutions will be brought in relation to the infamous Bloody Sunday killings. Campaigners for victims of state violence in Northern Ireland were quick to slam the secretary of state's comment that the security forces involved in killings were ""fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way"". Perhaps Mrs Bradley meant to use those words about soldiers and police officers who were found to have acted within the army's rules of engagement, but as she delivered her remarks in the Commons she appeared to be granting absolution to all security force personnel regardless of the circumstances. Whatever the case, there's no doubt that as the Bloody Sunday announcement draws closer, the government is under pressure from many of its own backbenchers and DUP MPs angered over what they regard as a ""witch hunt"" directed at military veterans. Less than an hour after Mrs Bradley spoke, Theresa May was on her feet dealing with the same issue, and confirming that the Ministry of Defence is considering potential legislation designed to ensure - in the prime minister's words that ""service personnel are not unfairly pursued through the courts"". However as those proposals are drawn up, you can expect they will provoke renewed controversy on either side of the debate over Northern Ireland's troubled past. Last year, Theresa May saidthe system for investigating the past in Northern Ireland was ""unfair"". The prime minister said only people in the ""armed forces"" or ""law enforcement"" were being investigated. However, in 2017, figures obtained by the BBC challenged claims thatTroubles investigations unduly focused on those committed by the Army.

But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries.

Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said. He said 90% of American farms were owned by families and cited his own mother, who he said continued to drive a tractor on the family's organic farm into her 90s. He added that he had confidence that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK would continue. ""Our relationship is more important than ever,"" he said.

"Jeremy Corbyn at Momentum rally during the 2017 general election campaign The Labour-supporting Momentum group has been fined Â£16,700 for ""multiple breaches of electoral law"", the Electoral Commission has said. This included the highest fine issued to a non-party campaign for not submitting an accurate spending return. The watchdog said poor record keeping by the group during the 2017 general election was one of the reasons for the fine. Momentum blamed clerical errors, which was ""not surprising"" for a new group. The grassroots group was formed out of the campaign that supported Jeremy Corbyn in his successful 2015 leadership bid and now campaigns for Labour. It is the first time the group has been investigated by the elections watchdog. The group registered as a non-party campaigner during the snap June 2017 general election and submitted a spending return to the commission in September 2017. But the watchdog says a ""number of issues"" were found and an investigation was launched in November 2017. Momentum was fined: Â£12,150 for failing to submit a spending return that was complete and accurate Â£2,700 for omitting Â£22,958.46 of reportable donations from a post-poll donation report Â£250 for failing to provide the required declaration to accompany their post-poll donations report Â£250 for failing to provide all required invoices with their spending return As a members' association, the group also had to report any donations above Â£7,500, under Electoral Commission rules. The watchdog found that two donations from the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) of Â£10,000 and Â£8,000 were not reported within 30 days of accepting them. The group was fined Â£900 and Â£450 for these failures respectively. The Momentum v Progress debate Louise Edwards, the commission's director of regulation, said: ""Non-party campaigners are essential for a healthy democracy. ""But just as crucial is that after a poll, voters can see complete and accurate spending data. ""The fines that we have levied reflect Momentum's repeated revisions to their spending return, poor record keeping and failure to follow advice given by the commission prior to the election."" She said non-party campaigners who seek to persuade people to vote a certain way have legal obligations and they should ""invest properly in having the right processes and staff to meet their obligations"". ""Momentum is unlike most non-party campaigners in that political campaigning is its full-time work, so it is particularly disappointing that they have failed to meet the law's requirements,"" she said. Momentum spokesperson Laura Parker said the group welcomed the findings that it did not overspend beyond the regulated limit in the 2017 general election. She said the watchdog ""did find some mistakes in our reporting and some clerical errors"", but added that this was ""not surprising for a new organisation"". The fines were ""disproportionate"" for ""incredibly minor"" offences"" she added. ""There were also various mitigating circumstances which should be taken into account. Momentum was a new, volunteer-led organisation and this was the first time we had to follow the regulations. ""We won't make these mistakes again.""

"Steven Sidebottom was found guilty of murdering and robbing Brian McKandie A man convicted of the brutal murder of a 67-year-old handyman who had Â£200,000 in cash hidden in his Aberdeenshire home has been jailed for life. Brian McKandie was found dead in his cottage near Rothienorman in 2016. Police initially treated his death as an accident but a post-mortem examination  later found he had suffered at least 15 blows to the head. Steven Sidebottom, 25, was told he wouldserve a minimum of 21 years for the murder and robbery,external. It is understood he is considering appealing against both conviction and sentence. Lord Uist told the father-of-one and first time offender he had been convicted of the murder of an ""inoffensive and popular"" man. The 'accidental death' that was a brutal murder An ordinary man with Â£200,000 hidden in his cottage The judge said: ""The degree of violence used was severe and extreme. ""This was in any view a very brutal murder. ""You have continued to deny your guilt since your conviction and shown no remorse."" He told Sidebottom: ""I consider that the appropriate punishment part in your case should be 22 years. I shall take into account the period of one year which you have already spent in custody on remand by reducing that period to 21 years."" It is thought Sidebottom got away with a few thousand pounds - but police later found about Â£200,000 stashed away in tins and shoeboxes in Mr McKandie's home. Mr McKandie lived in his rural cottage most of his life Sidebottom denied carrying out the attack in March 2016, but a jury at the High Court in Aberdeenreturned a majority guilty verdict last monthafter an 18-day trial. For many decades, Mr McKandie was known as someone who carried out cash-in-hand car repairs at the garage at his home, as well as fixing electrical items. He would often joke with customers that the money would ""top up"" his ""shoebox"". Seven weeks after his body was discovered in his rural cottage, police found numerous sweet and biscuit tins and shoeboxes filled with banknotes. Police found about Â£200,000 in notes in the cottage Mr McKandie's death featured on Crimewatch and a Â£10,000 reward was offered. Police attention turned to Sidebottom, who knew Mr McKandie and lived locally. Officers saw discrepancies in the information he had given them about being outside the pensioner's home in the days before he died. The main elements of the prosecution case included evidence of Sidebottom suddenly having what appeared to be ""thousands"" of pounds around the time of the murder, and that he had ""lavished"" gifts on his student girlfriend. There was also evidence of Sidebottom offering a friend Â£500 to drive him so he could ""do someone in"" to get money. However, Graeme Gray said he did not do the ""job"" as it sounded ""too risky"". The court also heard evidence that Sidebottom's mobile phone could have been in the area of Mr McKandie's home around the time he was believed to have been killed. The handyman worked in the garage next to his cottage It all formed part of the circumstantial case presented by advocate depute Iain McSporran for the prosecution. However, Sidebottom's defence counsel Ian Duguid QC argued that there was no evidence any money had been taken from Mr McKandie's home. The judge also noted that no DNA was found linking the accused to the crime, nor any fingerprints. Lord Uist told the jury that in order to convict Sidebottom, they would have to accept the ""whole package"" of the circumstantial case. Some members of the jury - who spent almost 11 hours considering the verdict over three days - were visibly upset as the verdict was delivered. Sidebottom showed no emotion. Mr McKandie's relatives said in a statement after the conviction: ""The reality is we will never understand why Brian - a complete gentleman - died in such a brutal and senseless way, and it is something we will never come to terms with."" Police Scotland welcomed Sidebottom's conviction for a ""cold and calculated murder"". Det Supt Iain Smith said: ""He killed Brian within the pensioner's own home in the most brutal of ways and a painstaking and thorough investigation was launched by Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team to bring this complex circumstantial case to court. ""The most important thing is that Brian's family now has the justice they deserve, as well as his friends who sat through every day of evidence in court and the vast amount of acquaintances he amassed during the decades spent working as a handyman in Rothienorman. ""I would once again like to thank Brian's family and in particular his brother Bill for their patience during the investigation and subsequent trial - they have all shown incredible dignity throughout."" Sidebottom was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"Reports that Will Smith is tipped to play Richard Williams have sparked accusations of colourism An upcoming biopic about the father of Serena and Venus Williams has faced criticism amid reports that Will Smith will play the lead role. Richard Williams, 77, coached his daughters to become two of the world's greatest tennis players, despite having no previous experience of the game. But Smith's reported casting in the film has angered critics, who say he is too light-skinned for the part. The actor has not yet commented on the reported casting or the criticism. Colourism is a form of discrimination against dark-skinned people in favour of those with lighter skin from the same race. Richard Williams coached his daughters to the top of the game It can lead to a lack of representation in film, TV and fashion, particularly in Hollywoodand Bollywood, as well as discrimination at work or on dating sites, and evento serious health problems from skin bleaching creams. This video can not be played Colourism: ""There's not just one way of being beautiful"" Do light-skinned black celebs have it easier? 'Colourism is big in the Asian community' British film No Shade tackles colourism and dating Smith's casting in the film has not been confirmed. However, aftera report from Deadline News,externalclaimed that the 50-year-old actor was ""poised to play"" Mr Williams, many people expressed their anger on social media. The criticism stems from the fact that Smith is significantly lighter than Mr Williams. US-based sports writer Clarence Hill Jr tweeted that ""colourism matters"", and said that Smith wasn't the right choice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"MPs questioned Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on Brexit backstop talks Commons leader Andrea Leadsom outlined future parliamentary business She confirmed MPs will vote on 12 March on whether to approve Brexit deal Shadow home secretary asked urgent question on knife crime EU officials call for the UK to suggest an âacceptableâ plan to resolve the Irish backstop impasse. The day in the Commons comes to an end with Labour MP Alison McGovern's adjournment debate on the regeneration of New Ferry, Wirral. The day began with questions to culture ministers, before Attorney General Geoffrey Cox faced some pressure from MPs to reveal details of the changes he is seeking to theIrish border backstop plan. Mr Cox said he was ""unable"" to comment on the specifics, but that UK negotiators were discussing ""detailed, coherent, careful proposals"" with the EU. In the business statement, Andrea Leadsom announced MPs will vote again on whether to approve the PM's Brexit deal on Tuesday - with the motion tabled on Monday. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament Summing up the debate on 70 years of the Commonwealth, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says it is ""a remarkable organisation with a remarkable reach"". She says moves must be made towards a fairer, more stable and prosperous Commonwealth, but that great progress is being made. ""We must ensure a modern Commonwealth can meet future challenges - from climate change to cyber attacks,"" she says. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament MPs are now on to the second backbench debate of the day on the opportunities and challenges facing the modern Commonwealth in its 70th year. The debate is led by Conservative MP James Duddridge and can continue until 5pm. Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Jess Phillips, as she has done in previous years, reads out the names of the women who have been killed by men in the past year, as recorded by the Counting Dead Women project. The Labour MP says these women are no longer here because ""they are hard to see, hard to hear and hard to believe"". After finishing reading out the list - which takes nearly seven minutes - Ms Phillips tells MPs: ""These women needs us, in this place, to hear their names and hear their stories."" Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Maria Miller is now opening the backbench debate on International Women's Day, which is celebrated tomorrow. 100 years ago Nancy Astor was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, Ms Miller says. The gender pay gap for women under 30 has all but disappeared she says, adding that great progress has been made with companies now forced to publish their gender pay gap: ""The issue is on the agenda"". But, she continues, ""there has not been enough progress at all"", and ""discrimination is still blatant."" Just one in three MPs are women, Ms Miller says, adding that this ""must be improved"". Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says the most important sentence in the report is that the Home Office has reviewed 11,800 Caribbean cases, but that around 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases were excluded. She asks Ms Hillier if she agrees that these large numbers of people cannot be ignored. Public Accounts Committee Chair Meg Hillier says the government must ""get a grip on this"", and that it is absolutely right that all those affected should receive support. ""It is very important that the government deals with this more effectively,"" she adds. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier says the Home Office ""failed to understand the real life impacts"" that it was implementing.

The report says the Home Office had failed to ""take ownership"" of problems it had created. It also accused the department of  ""complacency"" and shirking its responsibility in response to theWindrush scandal. The committee of MPs further criticised a decision to exclude up to 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases from a review carried out to identify how many people may have been affected. The Windrush scandal involved wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs"" experienced.

Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes calls for the prosecution of the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist group, Masood Azhar. ""Both sides have a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric, de-escalate the tension and avoid taking any further military action which could inflame the situation further,"" she says.

The situation ""remains fragile"", and both militaries remain on heightened alert, he adds. ""The situation could move quickly back into crisis"", Mr Field says, noting reports that a deadly grenade attack was carried out this morning. The captured Indian Wing Commander being reunited with his family ""is an important and welcome step by Pakistan to reduce tensions"", he adds. He calls on both countries to find a diplomatic solution to resolve the conflict and to ensure longer term regional stability in Kashmir. The UK ""stands ready to support discussions"" between the two countries, he adds, but notes that it is ""not for the UK to supply a solution or act as a mediator"". Foreign Office Minister Mark Field is now delivering a statement on Kashmir. Yesterday it was announced thatPakistan has detained dozens of suspected militantsfollowing an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which sparked a crisis with India. They include the brother and another relative of Masood Azhar, the founder of the group that claimed the attack.

The day in the Commons comes to an end with Labour MP Alison McGovern's adjournment debate on the regeneration of New Ferry, Wirral. The day began with questions to culture ministers, before Attorney General Geoffrey Cox faced some pressure from MPs to reveal details of the changes he is seeking to theIrish border backstop plan. Mr Cox said he was ""unable"" to comment on the specifics, but that UK negotiators were discussing ""detailed, coherent, careful proposals"" with the EU. In the business statement, Andrea Leadsom announced MPs will vote again on whether to approve the PM's Brexit deal on Tuesday - with the motion tabled on Monday. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament Summing up the debate on 70 years of the Commonwealth, Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin says it is ""a remarkable organisation with a remarkable reach"". She says moves must be made towards a fairer, more stable and prosperous Commonwealth, but that great progress is being made. ""We must ensure a modern Commonwealth can meet future challenges - from climate change to cyber attacks,"" she says. Debate on the Commonwealth House of CommonsParliament MPs are now on to the second backbench debate of the day on the opportunities and challenges facing the modern Commonwealth in its 70th year. The debate is led by Conservative MP James Duddridge and can continue until 5pm. Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Jess Phillips, as she has done in previous years, reads out the names of the women who have been killed by men in the past year, as recorded by the Counting Dead Women project. The Labour MP says these women are no longer here because ""they are hard to see, hard to hear and hard to believe"". After finishing reading out the list - which takes nearly seven minutes - Ms Phillips tells MPs: ""These women needs us, in this place, to hear their names and hear their stories."" Debate on International Women's Day House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Maria Miller is now opening the backbench debate on International Women's Day, which is celebrated tomorrow. 100 years ago Nancy Astor was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, Ms Miller says. The gender pay gap for women under 30 has all but disappeared she says, adding that great progress has been made with companies now forced to publish their gender pay gap: ""The issue is on the agenda"". But, she continues, ""there has not been enough progress at all"", and ""discrimination is still blatant."" Just one in three MPs are women, Ms Miller says, adding that this ""must be improved"". Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott says the most important sentence in the report is that the Home Office has reviewed 11,800 Caribbean cases, but that around 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases were excluded. She asks Ms Hillier if she agrees that these large numbers of people cannot be ignored. Public Accounts Committee Chair Meg Hillier says the government must ""get a grip on this"", and that it is absolutely right that all those affected should receive support. ""It is very important that the government deals with this more effectively,"" she adds. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush House of CommonsParliament Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier says the Home Office ""failed to understand the real life impacts"" that it was implementing. The government created ""huge problems"" for people by changing the rules, but were ""seemingly unaware"", she says, adding that the Home Office was warned about these problems and their potential impacts in 2014. ""Some people went on holiday to be told they could never come back,"" Ms Hillier adds. The government's Windrush Scheme ""has not helped everybody as it should have done"", she says. Public Accounts Committee report on Windrush MPs are now hearing a statement on the Commons Public Accounts Committee's (PAC) report on Windrush and the Home Office. The report says the Home Office had failed to ""take ownership"" of problems it had created. It also accused the department of  ""complacency"" and shirking its responsibility in response to theWindrush scandal. The committee of MPs further criticised a decision to exclude up to 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases from a review carried out to identify how many people may have been affected. The Windrush scandal involved wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs"" experienced.

Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes calls for the prosecution of the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist group, Masood Azhar. ""Both sides have a responsibility to dial down the rhetoric, de-escalate the tension and avoid taking any further military action which could inflame the situation further,"" she says. A major incident will occur from which there will be no going back, Ms McInnes adds, calling for ""immediate talks to prevent further military action"". It is time to break the cycle of children growing up surrounded by conflict and in fear, she concludes, adding: ""peace and stability must be brought to the people of Kashmir."" Kashmir Statement House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says there has been a ""welcome pause"" in the escalation of tensions, but the government remains ""deeply concerned"". The situation ""remains fragile"", and both militaries remain on heightened alert, he adds. ""The situation could move quickly back into crisis"", Mr Field says, noting reports that a deadly grenade attack was carried out this morning. The captured Indian Wing Commander being reunited with his family ""is an important and welcome step by Pakistan to reduce tensions"", he adds. He calls on both countries to find a diplomatic solution to resolve the conflict and to ensure longer term regional stability in Kashmir. The UK ""stands ready to support discussions"" between the two countries, he adds, but notes that it is ""not for the UK to supply a solution or act as a mediator"". Foreign Office Minister Mark Field is now delivering a statement on Kashmir. Yesterday it was announced thatPakistan has detained dozens of suspected militantsfollowing an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which sparked a crisis with India. They include the brother and another relative of Masood Azhar, the founder of the group that claimed the attack. The latest tensions began to unfold on 14 February when asuicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian soldiersin Indian-administered Kashmir. Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) said it carried out the attack, and on 26 February, India retaliated by carrying outair strikeson what it said was a JeM militant camp in Pakistan. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to respond and the day after the strike, a dogfight between the sides led to anIndian fighter jet being shot downin Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"The late suspect, a landscape gardener, had personal or business relationships with the victims German police are searching for anyone who knew a landscape gardener who may have targeted them by laying booby traps before he died. Bernhard Graumann, 59, was found dead on Friday. Police believe he may be behind an explosive trap that killed a 64-year-old doctor on the same day. Two other people with connections to Graumann were injured by an exploding piece of firewood in their home. Those who think Graumann held a grudge against them should contact the police. Bernhard Graumann, from the small town of Mehlingen in western Germany, died on the night of 1 March at his home. Police are awaiting an autopsy report. Earlier that day, a 64-year-old doctor in the nearby town of Enkenbach-Alsenborn was killed in a deliberate explosion. German police say the unnamed doctor was killed by a booby trap planted at the front door of the doctor's practice, which was apparently triggered when the victim picked a disguised device from the ground. Less than 10km (6 miles) away in Otterberg, there was another explosion on Sunday morning. Police said that a wooden log laced with explosives was placed into a wood-burning stove, exploding and injuring a mother and daughter after it was unknowingly added to the fire. It is assumed that the suspect deliberately placed the booby-trapped log in the home of the victims. Both victims were hospitalised, but neither are in life-threatening condition. ""The investigation of the criminal police showed that in both cases Bernhard Graumann is suspicious,"" police said in a statement. ""He had a personal or business connection with the victims,"" police said, adding he ""did not have a good relationship"" with them. ""In both cases, there had been conflicts in the past."" A search of Graumann's home resulted in the discovery of gunpowder and ""other items"" covered by explosive regulations. Crucially, police said they could not rule out that more traps had been prepared by the gardener before his death, which could put other people's lives in danger. German media report that Graumann was known to be a member of a local medieval association which apparently included, among other activities, recreating antique firearms that use gunpowder. ""People who have had a problematic private or business relationship with Graumann are urged to contact the police immediately,"" the police said. A special phone line has received dozens of calls, they said.

"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Counter-terrorism officers say they ""cannot confirm"" any links between Irish dissidents and explosive packages sent to three transport hubs in London. Devices delivered to London City Airport, Heathrow Airport and Waterloo Station on Tuesday all had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". But the devices have been linked withone sent to the University of Glasgow. Scotland Yard said it was ""pursuing a number of lines of inquiry"", including ""the possibility that the packages have come from Ireland"". Mr Haydon said no message appeared to be contained within the packages, no sender had been identified and no group had claimed responsibility. ""I cannot confirm at the moment if it's connected to any Ireland-related terrorist groups,"" he said. Extra police officers have been at Waterloo Station Mr Haydon said the devices, which are being checked for fingerprints and DNA, were ""not designed to kill"" but had ""some degree of sophistication"". Irish police are assisting the Met with its inquiries, the GardaÃ­ confirmed. Explosives found at airports and station Police Scotland said its counter terrorist officers were working with officers from the Met following the University of Glasgow incident. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem."" Neither of the packages sent to City Airport or Waterloo station were opened British Transport Police (BTP) said it had more officers on the transport network to provide ""reassurance"" after the London series. Both airports and Waterloo are running as normal, with London City Airport saying there would be a ""visible police presence"". Nobody was injured by the ""small improvised explosive devices"", which were found in white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. The first package caught fire when it was opened by staff at Heathrow's Compass Centre at about 09:55 GMT. The other two were discovered over the next three hours. Allow Twitter content?

The Met said all three appeared capable of igniting a small fire when opened.

"The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it Counter-terrorism officers say they ""cannot confirm"" any links between Irish dissidents and explosive packages sent to three transport hubs in London. Devices delivered to London City Airport, Heathrow Airport and Waterloo Station on Tuesday all had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". But the devices have been linked withone sent to the University of Glasgow. Scotland Yard said it was ""pursuing a number of lines of inquiry"", including ""the possibility that the packages have come from Ireland"". Mr Haydon said no message appeared to be contained within the packages, no sender had been identified and no group had claimed responsibility. ""I cannot confirm at the moment if it's connected to any Ireland-related terrorist groups,"" he said. Extra police officers have been at Waterloo Station Mr Haydon said the devices, which are being checked for fingerprints and DNA, were ""not designed to kill"" but had ""some degree of sophistication"". Irish police are assisting the Met with its inquiries, the GardaÃ­ confirmed. Explosives found at airports and station Police Scotland said its counter terrorist officers were working with officers from the Met following the University of Glasgow incident. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem."" Neither of the packages sent to City Airport or Waterloo station were opened British Transport Police (BTP) said it had more officers on the transport network to provide ""reassurance"" after the London series. Both airports and Waterloo are running as normal, with London City Airport saying there would be a ""visible police presence"". Nobody was injured by the ""small improvised explosive devices"", which were found in white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. The first package caught fire when it was opened by staff at Heathrow's Compass Centre at about 09:55 GMT. The other two were discovered over the next three hours. Allow Twitter content?

"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

"Cambridge University is to offer ""second chance"" places after A-level results for the first time this summer, in a deliberate bid to increase the number of disadvantaged students. There will be about 100 places available but only deprived students from the UK will be allowed to apply. The university has faced accusations of being socially exclusive. Cambridge says the scheme reflects its wish to recruit more disadvantaged youngsters - but it is not a ""quota"". The prestigious university has been attacked for a lack of diversity in its intake of about 3,500 undergraduates each year - such as too few students from poorer backgrounds or from deprived areas. Last week, BBC News revealedUK students had 500 fewer undergraduate places at Cambridge than a decade ago, while overseas student numbers had risen by 65%. In response, Cambridge has announced that it will give a second chance to about 100 disadvantaged youngsters currently at school in the UK. Plan revealed to cut fees to Â£7,500, but Brexit delay likely Shrinking number of UK students getting Oxbridge places revealed Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' These will be students who have already applied to the university but have been turned down in the main admissions process, who can now try to get a place after their exam results in the summer. It will use the ""adjustment"" process which runs alongside the clearing system after A-level results are published, which allows students with strong results to make a late change in their application. The places will depend on getting high exam results in the summer The type of disadvantage will include young people living in deprived areas, in places where few people go to university and who are at schools where few people have ever gained places at Cambridge or Oxford. Ethnicity will not be counted as a factor. Sir Peter Lampl,  who chairs the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said that Cambridge's plan for ""reserving places for disadvantaged young people"" was a ""step in the right direction"". But he said there was still a problem with many talented, poorer pupils not even applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or else having their exam grades under-predicted by their school. He said that the whole university admissions system should be changed so that all students ""apply only after they have received their A-level results"". Cambridge has been criticised for having a privileged intake - with figures recently showing thatonly 2% of students were white and working class. There have also been concerns that there aretoo few students from some ethnic minorities. About 2% of the intake for 2017-18 were black students. Cambridge says that its plan for reserved places in the summer is specifically about increasing the number of students from ""widening participation backgrounds"". The university says where these students, whose original applications were rejected, ""go on to achieve outstanding results, we want to open up the possibility for them to be reconsidered"". Rae Tooth, chief executive officer of the Villiers Park social mobility charity, backed the scheme but said universities ""need to become better at identifying and nurturing potential wherever it is"". She said: ""Results achieved by students from less advantaged backgrounds are not always reflective of their huge motivation or their ability. ""Often they face obstacles that are outside of their control and limit their potential."" Sam Lucy, Cambridge's director of admissions, said the university received more than 14,000 applications from the UK - and that some students might not have shown ""their full academic potential"" in applications and interviews. This new scheme would allow their applications ""to be reconsidered as soon as they have their final results"", with the prospect of places for those who achieved high results, she said. ""We hope this will have a positive impact in enabling us to admit talented students from under-represented groups who narrowly miss out in the first round,"" Ms Lucy added.

"Employers have formed an alliance to boost the number of jobs that pay the voluntary living wage A plan has been launched to make Dundee the first ""living wage city"" in the UK. Employers have joined forces in order to boost the number of jobs which pay the voluntary living wage of Â£9. More than 50 employers in Dundee have already committed to paying their staff and subcontractors the living wage, covering a quarter of all workers in the city. Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""The significance of the living wage cannot be overstated."" Scottish government unveils 'living wage nation' plans An alliance has been formed between the city council, DC Thomson and the local chamber of commerce among other employers to carry out the voluntary living wage plan. It comes more than a year after the Scottish government set out plans to make Scotland a ""living wage nation"" over the next three years. Measures include a regionally focused accreditation scheme for employers to create the UK's ""first living wage towns, cities and regions"". More than 50 employers in Dundee have committed to paying their employees the living wage The voluntary living wage increased last year to Â£9, more than Â£1 an hour above the National Living Wage of Â£7.83. Clare Goff, of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""Major employers within Dundee are working together to improve the lives of citizens and boost the local economy by making a real living wage the norm. ""The Living Wage Foundation has launched the Making Living Wage Places scheme to recognise groups of local 'anchor' institutions which not only pay the living wage to their employers and contractors, but which also seek to use their power and influence to spread living wage accreditation through their local area."" 'Real living wage' rises to Â£9 an hour Mr Hepburn, the Scottish Government's fair work minister, said: ""Evidence shows that paying it leads to increased productivity, better morale and lower sickness absence. It also demonstrates to the world that an organisation is committed to treating its workforce well. ""While Scotland is making good progress in becoming a living wage nation, and punches well above its weight in terms of the proportion of people paid at least the living wage, more remains to be done. ""The Scottish Government is committed to doing everything in our power to put fair work and equality at the heart of our labour market.""

"The UK won't be bound by future EU changes and can choose whether to accept them or not MPs have been promised a vote on any changes to workers' rights after Brexit as Theresa May seeks Labour support to pass her deal on leaving the EU. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs in Leave constituencies have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. But the TUC said they should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"". The union movement said what was being offered was ""flimsy procedural tweaks"". Brexit: A really simple guide Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? It comes as Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox emerged from their latest round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, as they seek to get legally-binding changes to the EU withdrawal agreement ahead of crunch Commons vote. Speaking after a meeting with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

"Iris scanning and facial recognition technology have been trialled to halt the prison drug supply Facial recognition and eye scanning have been deployed at prisons to prevent drug smuggling. The Ministry of Justice said the biometric scans for visitors were designed to help staff identify people bringing in contraband. At one prison, there were more ""no shows"" from visitors than usual after they learned the scans were being used. But prison campaigners said if families were deterred from visiting, then it would be ""counter-productive"". In the trials, facial recognition technology was used at HMP Humber; iris scanners at HMP Lindholme; and identity document verification at HMP Hull. Ministers considered the pilot programme ""successful"" and are considering how to roll out the technology more widely in prisons across England and Wales. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Last year prison staff across England and Wales seized more than 23,000 drug packages and mobile phones. Many methods were used to smuggle in the contraband, but intelligence work identified one trend in particular - prison visits. Over a six-week period in December and January, cameras scanned the faces of 770 visitors at HMP Humber, to spot if they were using false identities or making repeat trips to see different prisoners. Some visitors turned back after finding out facial matching software was in use. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""New technology is vital in our fight against the gangs that seek to cause chaos in prisons, and this biometric equipment has the potential to significantly aid our efforts."" He said that along with a prison officer recruitment drive, the technology would help to ""make prisons places of rehabilitation where offenders can turn their lives around"". It comes as the Prison Service struggles to stem the flow of the powerful synthetic drug Spice, blamed for outbreaks of violence, and illegal phones which are believed to be used to organise drug deliveries and intimidate witnesses. Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling The drug causing chaos in prison Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones The Ministry of Justice said that prison intelligence has identified a trend of visitors supplying banned items to inmates. But those responsible have proven difficult to track because they may be using false identity documents to gain access to the prison, it said. Some prisons use fingerprint technology, but many rely on physical ID documents such as driving licences. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said: ""If families and children are being deterred from visiting, that would be counterproductive. ""We need to see more of the evidence behind this apparent deterrent effect."" The campaign group Big Brother Watch, which has launcheda legal challenge to police plans to use automatic facial recognition in public places, said the prisons trial was a ""total shock"". It accused the government of taking an ""experimental approach to human rights"" by trying to win public acceptance for facial recognition cameras in controlled environments such as prisons, before it uses them as a general public surveillance tool.

The change we have made means that we take your UK nation (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales) into account in selecting stories at the top of the news homepage. This is an example of the stories at the top of the news homepage being different for the nations: All options still provide UK-wide stories, international stories and stories from the UK nations. The difference is that a team in each of the four nations is considering if any top stories are less relevant for that nation's audience and removing them if appropriate and adding in any stories that are more relevant. We expect that a lot of the time there will not be many changes. Some of the time there will be none. The nations feature is only available when you're signed into your BBC account. If you provided your postcode when registering for your BBC account, you'll automatically see more of the top stories for your nation (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales) when you are signed in. If you didn't provide a postcode, or if you'd like to change the selected nation, you can edit your preference using this settings option on the news homepage. You can also use this to choose to remain with the 'UK' option. In some situations we cannot reliably determine your nation from your postcode* so you'll see the 'UK' stories but you can select any of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales using the settings option on the news homepage. *this can happen because we use only the first part of your postcode (the postcode region) for this feature and some postcode regions overlap boundaries. The feature only affects the stories at the top of the news homepage. There won't always be different stories for your nation, so on some days you won't see any change. Can I give you feedback?

"This video can not be played Specialist paramedics are trying to free up ambulance crews in Lincolnshire The most critically injured patients in rural areas are at risk due to the time it takes the ambulance service to reach them, a BBC investigation has found. Some rural communities wait more than 20 minutes on average for 999 crews or trained members of the community to get to immediately life-threatening cases like cardiac arrests and stab victims. A response should come in six to eight minutes, depending on where you live. Experts said delays could make the difference between life and death. This was particularly the case for cardiac arrests where ""every second counts"", the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said. For the full interactive experience, please update your browser or enable JavaScript. Loading interactive map... Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Source: Ambulance trusts. Data is shown for postcode districts with more than nine highest category callouts in January-October 2018. Districts with 10-49 callouts are labelled ""low numbers"". Northern Ireland does not use comparable categorisation. Click here if you cannot see the interactive map,external Wells-next-the-Sea has longest wait for ambulances Ambulance bosses accepted some responses took longer than they should but said staff were working hard in ""challenging circumstances"" due to the levels of demand and the remote nature of some locations. They said expert advice was provided over the phone until a response arrived. Using the Freedom of Information Act, BBC News has obtained the average response times for the most life-threatening callouts in more than 2,700 local communities across Britain. These times cover the point at which a trained person reaches the patient - so it could be an ambulance or volunteers trained by the service to respond to these highest-priority cases. These calls include: cardiac arrests stab wounds major blood loss seizures patients not breathing or struggling to breathe women in the end stages of labour They represent about one in 20 emergency cases the ambulance service deals with, and are prioritised above all others because of the risk to life. The BBC News investigation shows there are some rural areas in Britain where it took over 20 minutes on average for the ambulance service to reach a patient during January to October last year. That compares with responses in under five minutes in a number of town and city neighbourhoods. Across all the communities in Britain, the average response time for rural areas was 11 minutes 13 seconds - more than 50% longer than the seven minutes 14 seconds it takes in urban areas. Northern Ireland categorises emergency calls differently to England, Wales and Scotland. Every moment counts for these patients - none more so than the cardiac arrest cases. Research has shown that if patients are given all the treatment immediately, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation - an electric shock to restart the heart, about two-thirds can survive. But every minute delay reduces survival by 10%. And this is one of the reasons why there has been a big emphasis on putting defibrillators in community settings and encouraging people to learn how to do CPR. Judy O'Sullivan, of the BHF, said it was ""critical"" that expert help from the ambulance services arrived as ""quickly as possible"". But she said CPR from ordinary members of the public was also vital - in the UK, this happens in less than half of cardiac arrests that occur out of hospital. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every second counts,"" Ms O'Sullivan added. There are different targets depending on where you live in the UK. In England, ambulance services are expected to reach patients within an average of seven minutes. That has to be a ""trained response"" - but this can include community first responders, who can be members of the public and off-duty health professionals, who have been given special training to deal with life-threatening conditions until an ambulance crew arrives. In Scotland the expectation is that at least half of patients will be reached in six minutes. In Wales, the target is that most patients are reached in eight minutes  - but having a defibrillator on scene and ready to use even if it is in the hands of a member of public counts as a response. The most immediately life-threatening calls are prioritised above all others by the ambulance services. And ambulances are automatically dispatched to the scene when one comes in. But control-room staff, such as Sue Hinton, who works for the West Midlands service, also step in to see if there are any other options if it looks like it will take some time to reach the patient. She likened it to a ""game of chess"", with crews stationed at different points in a region to give them the best chance of responding. ""You are constantly moving people around trying to get to the patients in the quickest time,"" she said. And rural areas were particularly ""challenging"" because of the distances involved, narrow roads and - when the weather was bad - the difficulty getting around. ""We utilise everything we have to get to patients as quickly as we can,"" Ms Hinton said And this included seeing if there were closer crews that could be diverted from other jobs as well as putting calls out to community first responders who may be closer to the scene and often know the areas better than ambulance crews. ""These trained volunteers are invaluable in rural areas,"" she added. It depends on how you cut the figures. BBC News analysed 586,000 emergency responses across more than 2,700 different postcode districts. About one in 10 callouts was to rural areas. There were 300 districts that had a very small numbers of critical cases, including some remote parts of Scotland where there was just one callout during the 10 months looked at. Some of these took over an hour to reach. There were 2,400 locations that had at least 10 callouts and a number of areas that waited over 20 minutes for a response. But to obtain a trustworthy response time for a local area, BBC News judged, there needed to have been at least 50 callouts over the time period - more than one a week. There were 2,000 locations with that level of demand. The single longest wait was seen in the NR23 postcode in and aroundWells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast, followed by RH14, in Chichester, Sussex. One former community responder in Wells-next-the-Sea told the BBC he resigned because of the length of time he was left with badly-injured patients before ambulance crews arrived. These waits also were longer than those in any district with more than 50 callouts in Wales or Scotland but the differences in the way response times are measured may be a factor in that. Ambulance services say they are expected to achieve the average target response times on a regional and national level only - not down to the super-local level looked at by BBC News. They also say there are other measures of performance, including the expectation that nine in 10 top-category callouts be reached within 15 minutes, that they perform better on. Nonetheless, ambulance chiefs accept they would like to do better. Anthony Marsh, who chairs the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the levels of demand and the remoteness of some areas presented ""challenging circumstances"" for the service. ""Our staff are working flat out to deal with record number of 999 calls, to reach all patients as quickly as they can whether they live in rural or urban areas,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly given the very rural nature of the majority of our country, there will be cases where we are longer to arrive than we would prefer."" Mr Marsh also pointed out control-room staff would, if needed, stay on the phone line to offer ""expert advice"" until help arrived. And he called on more members of the public to get trained in basic life support, so they would know what to do if faced with an emergency. Other steps are also being taken to improve the speed of responses. In some area,  police and fire crews have been enlisted and trained to respond to calls, while the BHF is in the process of working with ambulance services to map where defibrillators are - large numbers have been bought privately and are not registered on ambulance systems.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

"The UK won't be bound by future EU changes and can choose whether to accept them or not MPs have been promised a vote on any changes to workers' rights after Brexit as Theresa May seeks Labour support to pass her deal on leaving the EU. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs in Leave constituencies have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. But the TUC said they should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"". The union movement said what was being offered was ""flimsy procedural tweaks"". Brexit: A really simple guide Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? It comes as Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox emerged from their latest round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, as they seek to get legally-binding changes to the EU withdrawal agreement ahead of crunch Commons vote. Speaking after a meeting with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

"Cambridge University is to offer ""second chance"" places after A-level results for the first time this summer, in a deliberate bid to increase the number of disadvantaged students. There will be about 100 places available but only deprived students from the UK will be allowed to apply. The university has faced accusations of being socially exclusive. Cambridge says the scheme reflects its wish to recruit more disadvantaged youngsters - but it is not a ""quota"". The prestigious university has been attacked for a lack of diversity in its intake of about 3,500 undergraduates each year - such as too few students from poorer backgrounds or from deprived areas. Last week, BBC News revealedUK students had 500 fewer undergraduate places at Cambridge than a decade ago, while overseas student numbers had risen by 65%. In response, Cambridge has announced that it will give a second chance to about 100 disadvantaged youngsters currently at school in the UK. Plan revealed to cut fees to Â£7,500, but Brexit delay likely Shrinking number of UK students getting Oxbridge places revealed Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' These will be students who have already applied to the university but have been turned down in the main admissions process, who can now try to get a place after their exam results in the summer. It will use the ""adjustment"" process which runs alongside the clearing system after A-level results are published, which allows students with strong results to make a late change in their application. The places will depend on getting high exam results in the summer The type of disadvantage will include young people living in deprived areas, in places where few people go to university and who are at schools where few people have ever gained places at Cambridge or Oxford. Ethnicity will not be counted as a factor. Sir Peter Lampl,  who chairs the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said that Cambridge's plan for ""reserving places for disadvantaged young people"" was a ""step in the right direction"". But he said there was still a problem with many talented, poorer pupils not even applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or else having their exam grades under-predicted by their school. He said that the whole university admissions system should be changed so that all students ""apply only after they have received their A-level results"". Cambridge has been criticised for having a privileged intake - with figures recently showing thatonly 2% of students were white and working class. There have also been concerns that there aretoo few students from some ethnic minorities. About 2% of the intake for 2017-18 were black students. Cambridge says that its plan for reserved places in the summer is specifically about increasing the number of students from ""widening participation backgrounds"". The university says where these students, whose original applications were rejected, ""go on to achieve outstanding results, we want to open up the possibility for them to be reconsidered"". Rae Tooth, chief executive officer of the Villiers Park social mobility charity, backed the scheme but said universities ""need to become better at identifying and nurturing potential wherever it is"". She said: ""Results achieved by students from less advantaged backgrounds are not always reflective of their huge motivation or their ability. ""Often they face obstacles that are outside of their control and limit their potential."" Sam Lucy, Cambridge's director of admissions, said the university received more than 14,000 applications from the UK - and that some students might not have shown ""their full academic potential"" in applications and interviews. This new scheme would allow their applications ""to be reconsidered as soon as they have their final results"", with the prospect of places for those who achieved high results, she said. ""We hope this will have a positive impact in enabling us to admit talented students from under-represented groups who narrowly miss out in the first round,"" Ms Lucy added.

"Washington's ambassador to the UK has defended the US's approach to food hygiene and farming. Criticism of US food standards was ""designed to reduce not increase trade"", Woody Johnson told the BBC. US beef and chicken producers use processes not permitted in the EU, including rinsing chicken carcasses with chlorine. But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries. Read more:How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK farmer organisations have argued that while US production methods are safe, animal welfare and environmental standards are lower than in the UK. Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said. He said 90% of American farms were owned by families and cited his own mother, who he said continued to drive a tractor on the family's organic farm into her 90s. He added that he had confidence that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK would continue. ""Our relationship is more important than ever,"" he said.

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"Iris scanning and facial recognition technology have been trialled to halt the prison drug supply Facial recognition and eye scanning have been deployed at prisons to prevent drug smuggling. The Ministry of Justice said the biometric scans for visitors were designed to help staff identify people bringing in contraband. At one prison, there were more ""no shows"" from visitors than usual after they learned the scans were being used. But prison campaigners said if families were deterred from visiting, then it would be ""counter-productive"". In the trials, facial recognition technology was used at HMP Humber; iris scanners at HMP Lindholme; and identity document verification at HMP Hull. Ministers considered the pilot programme ""successful"" and are considering how to roll out the technology more widely in prisons across England and Wales. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Last year prison staff across England and Wales seized more than 23,000 drug packages and mobile phones. Many methods were used to smuggle in the contraband, but intelligence work identified one trend in particular - prison visits. Over a six-week period in December and January, cameras scanned the faces of 770 visitors at HMP Humber, to spot if they were using false identities or making repeat trips to see different prisoners. Some visitors turned back after finding out facial matching software was in use. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""New technology is vital in our fight against the gangs that seek to cause chaos in prisons, and this biometric equipment has the potential to significantly aid our efforts."" He said that along with a prison officer recruitment drive, the technology would help to ""make prisons places of rehabilitation where offenders can turn their lives around"". It comes as the Prison Service struggles to stem the flow of the powerful synthetic drug Spice, blamed for outbreaks of violence, and illegal phones which are believed to be used to organise drug deliveries and intimidate witnesses. Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling The drug causing chaos in prison Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones The Ministry of Justice said that prison intelligence has identified a trend of visitors supplying banned items to inmates. But those responsible have proven difficult to track because they may be using false identity documents to gain access to the prison, it said. Some prisons use fingerprint technology, but many rely on physical ID documents such as driving licences. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said: ""If families and children are being deterred from visiting, that would be counterproductive. ""We need to see more of the evidence behind this apparent deterrent effect."" The campaign group Big Brother Watch, which has launcheda legal challenge to police plans to use automatic facial recognition in public places, said the prisons trial was a ""total shock"". It accused the government of taking an ""experimental approach to human rights"" by trying to win public acceptance for facial recognition cameras in controlled environments such as prisons, before it uses them as a general public surveillance tool.

"Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches New satellite images of North Korea suggest it is restoring a rocket launch site it had pledged to dismantle, say analysts. The images were taken two days after talks between the leaders of the US and North Korea ended without them reaching a deal on denuclearisation. The Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing, never for ballistic missile launches. Work to dismantle it began last year but stopped as the US talks stalled. The pledge to dismantle ithad been seen as a confidence-building measure between Pyongyang and Washington. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Meanwhile, the US has warned North Korea could face yet more sanctions should Pyongyang not take steps to denuclearise. Satellite pictures show the site has been rebuilt The satellite evidence, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appears to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad at the Sohae site at Tongchang-ri. Images last July appeared to show the North had begun to dismantle the site. Sohae has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012. It has also been used for testing engines for missiles capable of reaching the US. But it has never been used for testing the ballistic missiles which have been considered so provocative. ""This distinction is important,"" Jenny Town,managing editor of monitoring group 38 North,external, told the BBC. ""The North Koreans likely see the rebuilding not as an active part of their missile programme, but of their civilian space programme - a distinction they have made repeatedly in the past,"" said Ms Town. She said the rebuilding of structures at the site could signal a lack of trust in the negotiations process. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This is indeed worth watching and the rebuilding work does send a rather ominous signal. But I'm always cautious of extrapolating meaning from satellite images. We cannot make assumptions about what is being discussed in the corridors of power in Pyongyang based on building work at a remote satellite launch station. This renewed activity may be Pyongyang's way of prodding Washington, just a little reminder to the Trump administration that it has the technology to build weapons and it will not give that up easily. Most analysts believe it is more likely, at this stage, that Mr Kim is testing Mr Trump's boundaries and patience, rather than getting ready to test a ballistic missile. If North Korea did go further than rebuilding a rocket test stand, and broke its pledge to stop testing missiles, it would risk the wrath of an unpredictable US president. The impoverished state could be slapped with even more economic sanctions. Mr Kim has sold these denuclearisation talks at home, and is cultivating his statesman-like image abroad - is he really ready to put that all at risk? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended last week in Hanoi without any deal or agreement. A historic first meeting last June in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress. The Hanoi talks were all smiles but little results The two leaders were unable to agree on how far North Korea should progress with denuclearisation before it was granted some sanctions relief. In a television interview on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said North Korea could yet face more sanctions. He said Washington would continue to watch whether Pyongyang was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons programme ""and everything associated with it"". ""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear. They're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact."" Observers, though, warn that adding fresh sanctions could completely stall the peace efforts. ""North Korea always reacts to the imposition of more sanctions in the same way: defiantly,"" Ms Town said. ""Imposing new sanctions now is only going to deflate whatever political will there may be to keep negotiating."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Trump-Kim summit: Who came out on top?

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers. ""We've agreed that by the end of the week we'll set out the scale of the investment required,"" she said.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? It comes after two 17-year-olds were killed in separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" In Lancashire,six people have been arrestedover a gang attack at a sixth form college.

Theresa May told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the killings of Jodie and Yousef were ""absolutely appalling"". Her official spokesman said the Home Office would co-ordinate an urgent series of ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work government was doing to support local councils and police. Mrs May said the problem would require ""a whole-of-government effort, in conjunction with the police, the wider public sector and local communities"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the prime minister for saying there was no direct link between the cut in police numbers and the increase in violent crime. In a video posted on Tuesday,external, he said young people ""shouldn't pay the price for austerity with their lives"". Police officer numbers in England and Wales havedropped by just under 20,000 since 2010,external, while levels of violent crime have risen in recent years. Figures released in February showed the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - 285 -was the highest since records began in 1946. But Donna Murray-Turner, who chairs the Croydon Safer Neighbourhood Board, does not believe more police officers will solve the issue. She told BBC Breakfast the problem of knife crime was ""far more complex and multi-layered than upping the numbers in police officers"" and called for greater ""community engagement"".

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers. ""We've agreed that by the end of the week we'll set out the scale of the investment required,"" she said. Durham's Chief Constable, Mike Barton, said he was ""heartened"" by the meeting while the chief constable of Merseyside Police said the talks were ""very good"". 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives Ahead of the meeting, spokespeople from a number of police bodies called for funding for more officers. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? It comes after two 17-year-olds were killed in separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" In Lancashire,six people have been arrestedover a gang attack at a sixth form college. A machete was found near Runshaw College in Leyland, following Monday's incident.

Theresa May told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the killings of Jodie and Yousef were ""absolutely appalling"". Her official spokesman said the Home Office would co-ordinate an urgent series of ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work government was doing to support local councils and police. Mrs May said the problem would require ""a whole-of-government effort, in conjunction with the police, the wider public sector and local communities"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the prime minister for saying there was no direct link between the cut in police numbers and the increase in violent crime. In a video posted on Tuesday,external, he said young people ""shouldn't pay the price for austerity with their lives"". Police officer numbers in England and Wales havedropped by just under 20,000 since 2010,external, while levels of violent crime have risen in recent years. Figures released in February showed the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - 285 -was the highest since records began in 1946. But Donna Murray-Turner, who chairs the Croydon Safer Neighbourhood Board, does not believe more police officers will solve the issue. She told BBC Breakfast the problem of knife crime was ""far more complex and multi-layered than upping the numbers in police officers"" and called for greater ""community engagement"".

"Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 and another died of his injuries some months later The sister of a man killed on Bloody Sunday has described a former soldier's comments on the shootings as ""very cold and very brutal"". Thirteen people died on the day and 15 were injured after troops opened fire in Londonderry in January 1972. The former paratrooper told the BBC thathe feels no guilt for what happened. He said he still considers it a job well done. Bloody Sunday: Tense wait for soldier prosecution decision Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report The man known as Sergeant 'O' is one of a number of ex-soldiers who will find out next week if they will be prosecuted over the killings The Saville Inquiry into the killings concluded that all the victims were innocent. Speaking to the BBC's Peter Taylor, Sergeant 'O' said that Lord Saville was not there on the day and whilst he accepted that some of those who were killed were innocent he did not accept that all of the victims were innocent. Kate Nash, whose 19-year-old brother William was shot dead described the soldier's comments as cold and as a lie. ""What a horrible lie to continue to stand by, even as you become an older person. ""Very cold and very brutal."" Eighteen ex-paratroopershave been reported to the PPSover the killings and the Bloody Sunday victims are currently waiting to hear if any will face charges. Michael McDaid, William Nash, John Young were killed on Bloody Sunday Lord Saville's official inquiry into the killings concluded that all victims were innocent and posed no threat. The paratroopers, he said, lost their self-control and fired without discipline. His unequivocal conclusion led the then prime minister, David Cameron, to deliver a historic apology in the House of Commons and to the people of Derry. What happened on Bloody Sunday, he said, was ""unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation following the report. The BBC previously obtained a letter from a senior public prosecutor detailing the criminal charges the soldiers could face. They include murder and attempted murder, wounding, perjury and joint enterprise, which means an offence where two or more people are involved.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected.

""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit.

"Cambridge University is to offer ""second chance"" places after A-level results for the first time this summer, in a deliberate bid to increase the number of disadvantaged students. There will be about 100 places available but only deprived students from the UK will be allowed to apply. The university has faced accusations of being socially exclusive. Cambridge says the scheme reflects its wish to recruit more disadvantaged youngsters - but it is not a ""quota"". The prestigious university has been attacked for a lack of diversity in its intake of about 3,500 undergraduates each year - such as too few students from poorer backgrounds or from deprived areas. Last week, BBC News revealedUK students had 500 fewer undergraduate places at Cambridge than a decade ago, while overseas student numbers had risen by 65%. In response, Cambridge has announced that it will give a second chance to about 100 disadvantaged youngsters currently at school in the UK. Plan revealed to cut fees to Â£7,500, but Brexit delay likely Shrinking number of UK students getting Oxbridge places revealed Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' These will be students who have already applied to the university but have been turned down in the main admissions process, who can now try to get a place after their exam results in the summer. It will use the ""adjustment"" process which runs alongside the clearing system after A-level results are published, which allows students with strong results to make a late change in their application. The places will depend on getting high exam results in the summer The type of disadvantage will include young people living in deprived areas, in places where few people go to university and who are at schools where few people have ever gained places at Cambridge or Oxford. Ethnicity will not be counted as a factor. Sir Peter Lampl,  who chairs the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said that Cambridge's plan for ""reserving places for disadvantaged young people"" was a ""step in the right direction"". But he said there was still a problem with many talented, poorer pupils not even applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or else having their exam grades under-predicted by their school. He said that the whole university admissions system should be changed so that all students ""apply only after they have received their A-level results"". Cambridge has been criticised for having a privileged intake - with figures recently showing thatonly 2% of students were white and working class. There have also been concerns that there aretoo few students from some ethnic minorities. About 2% of the intake for 2017-18 were black students. Cambridge says that its plan for reserved places in the summer is specifically about increasing the number of students from ""widening participation backgrounds"". The university says where these students, whose original applications were rejected, ""go on to achieve outstanding results, we want to open up the possibility for them to be reconsidered"". Rae Tooth, chief executive officer of the Villiers Park social mobility charity, backed the scheme but said universities ""need to become better at identifying and nurturing potential wherever it is"". She said: ""Results achieved by students from less advantaged backgrounds are not always reflective of their huge motivation or their ability. ""Often they face obstacles that are outside of their control and limit their potential."" Sam Lucy, Cambridge's director of admissions, said the university received more than 14,000 applications from the UK - and that some students might not have shown ""their full academic potential"" in applications and interviews. This new scheme would allow their applications ""to be reconsidered as soon as they have their final results"", with the prospect of places for those who achieved high results, she said. ""We hope this will have a positive impact in enabling us to admit talented students from under-represented groups who narrowly miss out in the first round,"" Ms Lucy added.

"Washington's ambassador to the UK has defended the US's approach to food hygiene and farming. Criticism of US food standards was ""designed to reduce not increase trade"", Woody Johnson told the BBC. US beef and chicken producers use processes not permitted in the EU, including rinsing chicken carcasses with chlorine. But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries. Read more:How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK farmer organisations have argued that while US production methods are safe, animal welfare and environmental standards are lower than in the UK. Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said. He said 90% of American farms were owned by families and cited his own mother, who he said continued to drive a tractor on the family's organic farm into her 90s. He added that he had confidence that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK would continue. ""Our relationship is more important than ever,"" he said.

'He had meltdowns, he just couldn't cope' One in 10 NI children have mental illness Mental health problems in NI 'like a tsunami' 'I hadn't even heard of depression' The idea is to provide on the spot mental health treatment where the crisis is developing rather than a lengthy wait in a hospital Emergency Department. ""The difficulty arises when police officers arrive at someone's home, if they're in crisis the last thing they want to see is a police officer,"" explained Insp Mark Cavanagh, who heads up the project for the police. Insp Mark Cavanagh is the lead police officer on the project ""Very often, if the crisis can't be averted the police then have to accompany the person to an emergency department, adding to the stigma the patient feels, and very often it's a very time-consuming use of police time."" Don Bradley, who is in charge of mental health services for the South Eastern Trust, said it was often better for the person going through that distress if they could be treated where the emergency was arising. ""It could help defuse the situation and prevent a lot more distress or even further trauma, so that's why we all came together,"" he said. The pilot currently operates in North Down and Lisburn at weekends. The Multi-Agency Triage Team (MATT) briefs officers going on shift reminding them that they're available and can be contacted directly to assist people with a mental health vulnerability. The team can then talk to the person on the phone and travel to see them with a paramedic and an ambulance on hand. Paramedics have a range of skills to deal with people they assess but are limited in terms of mental health issues, said the Ambulance Service's Ciaran McKenna. The Multi-Agency Triage Team briefs officers ahead of their shift On one Saturday night in February, the first call was about a 38-year-old patient on a mental health ward who had left the hospital. He was deemed as ""high-risk"". Insp Cavanagh explained: ""We find that there is information on the health systems that we simply wouldn't have access to and whenever someone is high-risk that's where we join forces and try to locate that person and ensure their safety."" Karen McMillan, a Psychiatric Nurse on the team, said their database has access to the patient's full history. ""We would also have most likely up-to-date contact numbers and we would in the first attempt try to locate this person,"" she said. ""We've been successful in the past where a missing person will take our call because we're from mental health and we've been able to keep that person on the line and engage that person to the extent that they will say where they are. ""Then we continue to talk to them on the phone while the police find them."" At 02:00 GMT another call came in about from the family of a 30-year-old man who was threatening to take his own life. Local police officers were already at the man's house, but so far he has remained in a highly distressed state, causing a major concern to his family. Ms McMillan talked to him on the phone and within minutes he started opening up about his concerns. Psychiatric nurse Karen McMillan responds to many of the calls He hadn't had any previous help from mental health services but had been at his local emergency department earlier in the day; he became agitated by the waiting time and left. Ms McMillan asked him if he'd be willing to speak to a mental health nurse face-to-face, and he agreed. ""He is looking for help,"" she explained. ""He has a lot of problems, he is struggling but he is seeking help."" ""He feels that no one wants to help him and to break that down took a bit of time."" The team set off to his home and treated him in his own environment. Insp Mark Cavanagh says it is important to have the help of other emergency services as some callers can be hesitant to see police officers at their homes This is what makes this pilot scheme so unique. ""To have a mental health nurse sitting in someone's living room at 02:30 to offer that level of comfort and support to an individual in crisis,"" said Insp Cavanagh. Forty minutes later, the mental health team had helped the patient and his family. ""Mental health problems impact on the whole family and we were able to offer them support too,"" said Ms McMillan. Returning to police headquarters, Insp Cavanagh said that call epitomises everything the services are trying to do. ""We got someone who was in crisis who had contacted the police the help and support they needed at 02:30, and that says it all,"" he said. ""Ordinarily we couldn't have offered that level of support, so we have to be eternally grateful for our partners the Ambulance Service and the South Eastern Trust for being there when we need them most."" Ms McMillan agreed, saying the services work well as a team. ""We've developed a very good working relationship,"" she said. ""We enhance each other's service - this patient got a specialist service and we also got to give advice to his family."" It's hoped that the pilot scheme will eventually be rolled out across Northern Ireland. Is young people's mental health getting worse?

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"Iris scanning and facial recognition technology have been trialled to halt the prison drug supply Facial recognition and eye scanning have been deployed at prisons to prevent drug smuggling. The Ministry of Justice said the biometric scans for visitors were designed to help staff identify people bringing in contraband. At one prison, there were more ""no shows"" from visitors than usual after they learned the scans were being used. But prison campaigners said if families were deterred from visiting, then it would be ""counter-productive"". In the trials, facial recognition technology was used at HMP Humber; iris scanners at HMP Lindholme; and identity document verification at HMP Hull. Ministers considered the pilot programme ""successful"" and are considering how to roll out the technology more widely in prisons across England and Wales. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Last year prison staff across England and Wales seized more than 23,000 drug packages and mobile phones. Many methods were used to smuggle in the contraband, but intelligence work identified one trend in particular - prison visits. Over a six-week period in December and January, cameras scanned the faces of 770 visitors at HMP Humber, to spot if they were using false identities or making repeat trips to see different prisoners. Some visitors turned back after finding out facial matching software was in use. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""New technology is vital in our fight against the gangs that seek to cause chaos in prisons, and this biometric equipment has the potential to significantly aid our efforts."" He said that along with a prison officer recruitment drive, the technology would help to ""make prisons places of rehabilitation where offenders can turn their lives around"". It comes as the Prison Service struggles to stem the flow of the powerful synthetic drug Spice, blamed for outbreaks of violence, and illegal phones which are believed to be used to organise drug deliveries and intimidate witnesses. Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling The drug causing chaos in prison Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones The Ministry of Justice said that prison intelligence has identified a trend of visitors supplying banned items to inmates. But those responsible have proven difficult to track because they may be using false identity documents to gain access to the prison, it said. Some prisons use fingerprint technology, but many rely on physical ID documents such as driving licences. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said: ""If families and children are being deterred from visiting, that would be counterproductive. ""We need to see more of the evidence behind this apparent deterrent effect."" The campaign group Big Brother Watch, which has launcheda legal challenge to police plans to use automatic facial recognition in public places, said the prisons trial was a ""total shock"". It accused the government of taking an ""experimental approach to human rights"" by trying to win public acceptance for facial recognition cameras in controlled environments such as prisons, before it uses them as a general public surveillance tool.

"Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches New satellite images of North Korea suggest it is restoring a rocket launch site it had pledged to dismantle, say analysts. The images were taken two days after talks between the leaders of the US and North Korea ended without them reaching a deal on denuclearisation. The Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing, never for ballistic missile launches. Work to dismantle it began last year but stopped as the US talks stalled. The pledge to dismantle ithad been seen as a confidence-building measure between Pyongyang and Washington. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Meanwhile, the US has warned North Korea could face yet more sanctions should Pyongyang not take steps to denuclearise. Satellite pictures show the site has been rebuilt The satellite evidence, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appears to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad at the Sohae site at Tongchang-ri. Images last July appeared to show the North had begun to dismantle the site. Sohae has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012. It has also been used for testing engines for missiles capable of reaching the US. But it has never been used for testing the ballistic missiles which have been considered so provocative. ""This distinction is important,"" Jenny Town,managing editor of monitoring group 38 North,external, told the BBC. ""The North Koreans likely see the rebuilding not as an active part of their missile programme, but of their civilian space programme - a distinction they have made repeatedly in the past,"" said Ms Town. She said the rebuilding of structures at the site could signal a lack of trust in the negotiations process. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This is indeed worth watching and the rebuilding work does send a rather ominous signal. But I'm always cautious of extrapolating meaning from satellite images. We cannot make assumptions about what is being discussed in the corridors of power in Pyongyang based on building work at a remote satellite launch station. This renewed activity may be Pyongyang's way of prodding Washington, just a little reminder to the Trump administration that it has the technology to build weapons and it will not give that up easily. Most analysts believe it is more likely, at this stage, that Mr Kim is testing Mr Trump's boundaries and patience, rather than getting ready to test a ballistic missile. If North Korea did go further than rebuilding a rocket test stand, and broke its pledge to stop testing missiles, it would risk the wrath of an unpredictable US president. The impoverished state could be slapped with even more economic sanctions. Mr Kim has sold these denuclearisation talks at home, and is cultivating his statesman-like image abroad - is he really ready to put that all at risk? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended last week in Hanoi without any deal or agreement. A historic first meeting last June in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress. The Hanoi talks were all smiles but little results The two leaders were unable to agree on how far North Korea should progress with denuclearisation before it was granted some sanctions relief. In a television interview on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said North Korea could yet face more sanctions. He said Washington would continue to watch whether Pyongyang was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons programme ""and everything associated with it"". ""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear. They're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact."" Observers, though, warn that adding fresh sanctions could completely stall the peace efforts. ""North Korea always reacts to the imposition of more sanctions in the same way: defiantly,"" Ms Town said. ""Imposing new sanctions now is only going to deflate whatever political will there may be to keep negotiating."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Trump-Kim summit: Who came out on top?

"A review has been carried out of policing at football matches A report into policing in Scottish football has identified serious concerns around stadium safety which are putting fans at risk. Findings included incidents of clubs gaining safety certificates without stadium inspections and selling more tickets than the ground capacity. Rangers' away games while in the lower leagues prompted serious concerns. Unsafe temporary scaffolding was discovered, with safety certificates altered to increase stadium capacity. The report states,external: ""This review highlights a lack of strategic oversight and co-ordination to ensure a corporate approach to safety certification. ""The review takes the view this gap should be seen as a significant risk to the safety of spectators and be addressed with the utmost priority."" The report, which was commissioned by Police Scotland followinga crush outside Celtic Parklast year, also highlighted a need for better stewarding and better engagement with fans. However, Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, who was tasked with compiling the report, says overall the current policing of Scottish football is fit for purpose. His team looked at operational planning for matches, intelligence gathering and allocation of police resources on match days. Police Scotland announced they hadasked Dep Ch Con Mark Roberts to conduct the reviewone month after a crush at Celtic Park, but insisted the review was not triggered by a particular incident.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers. ""We've agreed that by the end of the week we'll set out the scale of the investment required,"" she said.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces.""

Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now.

"This video can not be played Specialist paramedics are trying to free up ambulance crews in Lincolnshire The most critically injured patients in rural areas are at risk due to the time it takes the ambulance service to reach them, a BBC investigation has found. Some rural communities wait more than 20 minutes on average for 999 crews or trained members of the community to get to immediately life-threatening cases like cardiac arrests and stab victims. A response should come in six to eight minutes, depending on where you live. Experts said delays could make the difference between life and death. This was particularly the case for cardiac arrests where ""every second counts"", the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said. For the full interactive experience, please update your browser or enable JavaScript. Loading interactive map... Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Source: Ambulance trusts. Data is shown for postcode districts with more than nine highest category callouts in January-October 2018. Districts with 10-49 callouts are labelled ""low numbers"". Northern Ireland does not use comparable categorisation. Click here if you cannot see the interactive map,external Wells-next-the-Sea has longest wait for ambulances Ambulance bosses accepted some responses took longer than they should but said staff were working hard in ""challenging circumstances"" due to the levels of demand and the remote nature of some locations. They said expert advice was provided over the phone until a response arrived. Using the Freedom of Information Act, BBC News has obtained the average response times for the most life-threatening callouts in more than 2,700 local communities across Britain. These times cover the point at which a trained person reaches the patient - so it could be an ambulance or volunteers trained by the service to respond to these highest-priority cases. These calls include: cardiac arrests stab wounds major blood loss seizures patients not breathing or struggling to breathe women in the end stages of labour They represent about one in 20 emergency cases the ambulance service deals with, and are prioritised above all others because of the risk to life. The BBC News investigation shows there are some rural areas in Britain where it took over 20 minutes on average for the ambulance service to reach a patient during January to October last year. That compares with responses in under five minutes in a number of town and city neighbourhoods. Across all the communities in Britain, the average response time for rural areas was 11 minutes 13 seconds - more than 50% longer than the seven minutes 14 seconds it takes in urban areas. Northern Ireland categorises emergency calls differently to England, Wales and Scotland. Every moment counts for these patients - none more so than the cardiac arrest cases. Research has shown that if patients are given all the treatment immediately, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation - an electric shock to restart the heart, about two-thirds can survive. But every minute delay reduces survival by 10%. And this is one of the reasons why there has been a big emphasis on putting defibrillators in community settings and encouraging people to learn how to do CPR. Judy O'Sullivan, of the BHF, said it was ""critical"" that expert help from the ambulance services arrived as ""quickly as possible"". But she said CPR from ordinary members of the public was also vital - in the UK, this happens in less than half of cardiac arrests that occur out of hospital. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every second counts,"" Ms O'Sullivan added. There are different targets depending on where you live in the UK. In England, ambulance services are expected to reach patients within an average of seven minutes. That has to be a ""trained response"" - but this can include community first responders, who can be members of the public and off-duty health professionals, who have been given special training to deal with life-threatening conditions until an ambulance crew arrives. In Scotland the expectation is that at least half of patients will be reached in six minutes. In Wales, the target is that most patients are reached in eight minutes  - but having a defibrillator on scene and ready to use even if it is in the hands of a member of public counts as a response. The most immediately life-threatening calls are prioritised above all others by the ambulance services. And ambulances are automatically dispatched to the scene when one comes in. But control-room staff, such as Sue Hinton, who works for the West Midlands service, also step in to see if there are any other options if it looks like it will take some time to reach the patient. She likened it to a ""game of chess"", with crews stationed at different points in a region to give them the best chance of responding. ""You are constantly moving people around trying to get to the patients in the quickest time,"" she said. And rural areas were particularly ""challenging"" because of the distances involved, narrow roads and - when the weather was bad - the difficulty getting around. ""We utilise everything we have to get to patients as quickly as we can,"" Ms Hinton said And this included seeing if there were closer crews that could be diverted from other jobs as well as putting calls out to community first responders who may be closer to the scene and often know the areas better than ambulance crews. ""These trained volunteers are invaluable in rural areas,"" she added. It depends on how you cut the figures. BBC News analysed 586,000 emergency responses across more than 2,700 different postcode districts. About one in 10 callouts was to rural areas. There were 300 districts that had a very small numbers of critical cases, including some remote parts of Scotland where there was just one callout during the 10 months looked at. Some of these took over an hour to reach. There were 2,400 locations that had at least 10 callouts and a number of areas that waited over 20 minutes for a response. But to obtain a trustworthy response time for a local area, BBC News judged, there needed to have been at least 50 callouts over the time period - more than one a week. There were 2,000 locations with that level of demand. The single longest wait was seen in the NR23 postcode in and aroundWells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast, followed by RH14, in Chichester, Sussex. One former community responder in Wells-next-the-Sea told the BBC he resigned because of the length of time he was left with badly-injured patients before ambulance crews arrived. These waits also were longer than those in any district with more than 50 callouts in Wales or Scotland but the differences in the way response times are measured may be a factor in that. Ambulance services say they are expected to achieve the average target response times on a regional and national level only - not down to the super-local level looked at by BBC News. They also say there are other measures of performance, including the expectation that nine in 10 top-category callouts be reached within 15 minutes, that they perform better on. Nonetheless, ambulance chiefs accept they would like to do better. Anthony Marsh, who chairs the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the levels of demand and the remoteness of some areas presented ""challenging circumstances"" for the service. ""Our staff are working flat out to deal with record number of 999 calls, to reach all patients as quickly as they can whether they live in rural or urban areas,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly given the very rural nature of the majority of our country, there will be cases where we are longer to arrive than we would prefer."" Mr Marsh also pointed out control-room staff would, if needed, stay on the phone line to offer ""expert advice"" until help arrived. And he called on more members of the public to get trained in basic life support, so they would know what to do if faced with an emergency. Other steps are also being taken to improve the speed of responses. In some area,  police and fire crews have been enlisted and trained to respond to calls, while the BHF is in the process of working with ambulance services to map where defibrillators are - large numbers have been bought privately and are not registered on ambulance systems.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for.

Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

"The UK won't be bound by future EU changes and can choose whether to accept them or not MPs have been promised a vote on any changes to workers' rights after Brexit as Theresa May seeks Labour support to pass her deal on leaving the EU. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs in Leave constituencies have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. But the TUC said they should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"". The union movement said what was being offered was ""flimsy procedural tweaks"". Brexit: A really simple guide Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? It comes as Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox emerged from their latest round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, as they seek to get legally-binding changes to the EU withdrawal agreement ahead of crunch Commons vote. Speaking after a meeting with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

"Cambridge University is to offer ""second chance"" places after A-level results for the first time this summer, in a deliberate bid to increase the number of disadvantaged students. There will be about 100 places available but only deprived students from the UK will be allowed to apply. The university has faced accusations of being socially exclusive. Cambridge says the scheme reflects its wish to recruit more disadvantaged youngsters - but it is not a ""quota"". The prestigious university has been attacked for a lack of diversity in its intake of about 3,500 undergraduates each year - such as too few students from poorer backgrounds or from deprived areas. Last week, BBC News revealedUK students had 500 fewer undergraduate places at Cambridge than a decade ago, while overseas student numbers had risen by 65%. In response, Cambridge has announced that it will give a second chance to about 100 disadvantaged youngsters currently at school in the UK. Plan revealed to cut fees to Â£7,500, but Brexit delay likely Shrinking number of UK students getting Oxbridge places revealed Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' These will be students who have already applied to the university but have been turned down in the main admissions process, who can now try to get a place after their exam results in the summer. It will use the ""adjustment"" process which runs alongside the clearing system after A-level results are published, which allows students with strong results to make a late change in their application. The places will depend on getting high exam results in the summer The type of disadvantage will include young people living in deprived areas, in places where few people go to university and who are at schools where few people have ever gained places at Cambridge or Oxford. Ethnicity will not be counted as a factor. Sir Peter Lampl,  who chairs the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said that Cambridge's plan for ""reserving places for disadvantaged young people"" was a ""step in the right direction"". But he said there was still a problem with many talented, poorer pupils not even applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or else having their exam grades under-predicted by their school. He said that the whole university admissions system should be changed so that all students ""apply only after they have received their A-level results"". Cambridge has been criticised for having a privileged intake - with figures recently showing thatonly 2% of students were white and working class. There have also been concerns that there aretoo few students from some ethnic minorities. About 2% of the intake for 2017-18 were black students. Cambridge says that its plan for reserved places in the summer is specifically about increasing the number of students from ""widening participation backgrounds"". The university says where these students, whose original applications were rejected, ""go on to achieve outstanding results, we want to open up the possibility for them to be reconsidered"". Rae Tooth, chief executive officer of the Villiers Park social mobility charity, backed the scheme but said universities ""need to become better at identifying and nurturing potential wherever it is"". She said: ""Results achieved by students from less advantaged backgrounds are not always reflective of their huge motivation or their ability. ""Often they face obstacles that are outside of their control and limit their potential."" Sam Lucy, Cambridge's director of admissions, said the university received more than 14,000 applications from the UK - and that some students might not have shown ""their full academic potential"" in applications and interviews. This new scheme would allow their applications ""to be reconsidered as soon as they have their final results"", with the prospect of places for those who achieved high results, she said. ""We hope this will have a positive impact in enabling us to admit talented students from under-represented groups who narrowly miss out in the first round,"" Ms Lucy added.

"Washington's ambassador to the UK has defended the US's approach to food hygiene and farming. Criticism of US food standards was ""designed to reduce not increase trade"", Woody Johnson told the BBC. US beef and chicken producers use processes not permitted in the EU, including rinsing chicken carcasses with chlorine. But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries. Read more:How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK farmer organisations have argued that while US production methods are safe, animal welfare and environmental standards are lower than in the UK. Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said.

"Employers have formed an alliance to boost the number of jobs that pay the voluntary living wage A plan has been launched to make Dundee the first ""living wage city"" in the UK. Employers have joined forces in order to boost the number of jobs which pay the voluntary living wage of Â£9. More than 50 employers in Dundee have already committed to paying their staff and subcontractors the living wage, covering a quarter of all workers in the city. Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""The significance of the living wage cannot be overstated."" Scottish government unveils 'living wage nation' plans An alliance has been formed between the city council, DC Thomson and the local chamber of commerce among other employers to carry out the voluntary living wage plan. It comes more than a year after the Scottish government set out plans to make Scotland a ""living wage nation"" over the next three years. Measures include a regionally focused accreditation scheme for employers to create the UK's ""first living wage towns, cities and regions"". More than 50 employers in Dundee have committed to paying their employees the living wage The voluntary living wage increased last year to Â£9, more than Â£1 an hour above the National Living Wage of Â£7.83. Clare Goff, of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""Major employers within Dundee are working together to improve the lives of citizens and boost the local economy by making a real living wage the norm. ""The Living Wage Foundation has launched the Making Living Wage Places scheme to recognise groups of local 'anchor' institutions which not only pay the living wage to their employers and contractors, but which also seek to use their power and influence to spread living wage accreditation through their local area."" 'Real living wage' rises to Â£9 an hour Mr Hepburn, the Scottish Government's fair work minister, said: ""Evidence shows that paying it leads to increased productivity, better morale and lower sickness absence. It also demonstrates to the world that an organisation is committed to treating its workforce well. ""While Scotland is making good progress in becoming a living wage nation, and punches well above its weight in terms of the proportion of people paid at least the living wage, more remains to be done. ""The Scottish Government is committed to doing everything in our power to put fair work and equality at the heart of our labour market.""

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches New satellite images of North Korea suggest it is restoring a rocket launch site it had pledged to dismantle, say analysts. The images were taken two days after talks between the leaders of the US and North Korea ended without them reaching a deal on denuclearisation. The Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing, never for ballistic missile launches. Work to dismantle it began last year but stopped as the US talks stalled. The pledge to dismantle ithad been seen as a confidence-building measure between Pyongyang and Washington. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Meanwhile, the US has warned North Korea could face yet more sanctions should Pyongyang not take steps to denuclearise. Satellite pictures show the site has been rebuilt The satellite evidence, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appears to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad at the Sohae site at Tongchang-ri. Images last July appeared to show the North had begun to dismantle the site. Sohae has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012. It has also been used for testing engines for missiles capable of reaching the US. But it has never been used for testing the ballistic missiles which have been considered so provocative. ""This distinction is important,"" Jenny Town,managing editor of monitoring group 38 North,external, told the BBC. ""The North Koreans likely see the rebuilding not as an active part of their missile programme, but of their civilian space programme - a distinction they have made repeatedly in the past,"" said Ms Town. She said the rebuilding of structures at the site could signal a lack of trust in the negotiations process. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This is indeed worth watching and the rebuilding work does send a rather ominous signal. But I'm always cautious of extrapolating meaning from satellite images. We cannot make assumptions about what is being discussed in the corridors of power in Pyongyang based on building work at a remote satellite launch station. This renewed activity may be Pyongyang's way of prodding Washington, just a little reminder to the Trump administration that it has the technology to build weapons and it will not give that up easily. Most analysts believe it is more likely, at this stage, that Mr Kim is testing Mr Trump's boundaries and patience, rather than getting ready to test a ballistic missile. If North Korea did go further than rebuilding a rocket test stand, and broke its pledge to stop testing missiles, it would risk the wrath of an unpredictable US president. The impoverished state could be slapped with even more economic sanctions. Mr Kim has sold these denuclearisation talks at home, and is cultivating his statesman-like image abroad - is he really ready to put that all at risk? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended last week in Hanoi without any deal or agreement. A historic first meeting last June in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress. The Hanoi talks were all smiles but little results The two leaders were unable to agree on how far North Korea should progress with denuclearisation before it was granted some sanctions relief. In a television interview on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said North Korea could yet face more sanctions. He said Washington would continue to watch whether Pyongyang was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons programme ""and everything associated with it"". ""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear. They're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact."" Observers, though, warn that adding fresh sanctions could completely stall the peace efforts. ""North Korea always reacts to the imposition of more sanctions in the same way: defiantly,"" Ms Town said. ""Imposing new sanctions now is only going to deflate whatever political will there may be to keep negotiating."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Trump-Kim summit: Who came out on top?

"This video can not be played Specialist paramedics are trying to free up ambulance crews in Lincolnshire The most critically injured patients in rural areas are at risk due to the time it takes the ambulance service to reach them, a BBC investigation has found. Some rural communities wait more than 20 minutes on average for 999 crews or trained members of the community to get to immediately life-threatening cases like cardiac arrests and stab victims. A response should come in six to eight minutes, depending on where you live. Experts said delays could make the difference between life and death. This was particularly the case for cardiac arrests where ""every second counts"", the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said. For the full interactive experience, please update your browser or enable JavaScript. Loading interactive map... Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Source: Ambulance trusts. Data is shown for postcode districts with more than nine highest category callouts in January-October 2018. Districts with 10-49 callouts are labelled ""low numbers"". Northern Ireland does not use comparable categorisation. Click here if you cannot see the interactive map,external Wells-next-the-Sea has longest wait for ambulances Ambulance bosses accepted some responses took longer than they should but said staff were working hard in ""challenging circumstances"" due to the levels of demand and the remote nature of some locations. They said expert advice was provided over the phone until a response arrived. Using the Freedom of Information Act, BBC News has obtained the average response times for the most life-threatening callouts in more than 2,700 local communities across Britain. These times cover the point at which a trained person reaches the patient - so it could be an ambulance or volunteers trained by the service to respond to these highest-priority cases. These calls include: cardiac arrests stab wounds major blood loss seizures patients not breathing or struggling to breathe women in the end stages of labour They represent about one in 20 emergency cases the ambulance service deals with, and are prioritised above all others because of the risk to life. The BBC News investigation shows there are some rural areas in Britain where it took over 20 minutes on average for the ambulance service to reach a patient during January to October last year. That compares with responses in under five minutes in a number of town and city neighbourhoods. Across all the communities in Britain, the average response time for rural areas was 11 minutes 13 seconds - more than 50% longer than the seven minutes 14 seconds it takes in urban areas. Northern Ireland categorises emergency calls differently to England, Wales and Scotland. Every moment counts for these patients - none more so than the cardiac arrest cases. Research has shown that if patients are given all the treatment immediately, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation - an electric shock to restart the heart, about two-thirds can survive. But every minute delay reduces survival by 10%. And this is one of the reasons why there has been a big emphasis on putting defibrillators in community settings and encouraging people to learn how to do CPR. Judy O'Sullivan, of the BHF, said it was ""critical"" that expert help from the ambulance services arrived as ""quickly as possible"". But she said CPR from ordinary members of the public was also vital - in the UK, this happens in less than half of cardiac arrests that occur out of hospital. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every second counts,"" Ms O'Sullivan added. There are different targets depending on where you live in the UK. In England, ambulance services are expected to reach patients within an average of seven minutes. That has to be a ""trained response"" - but this can include community first responders, who can be members of the public and off-duty health professionals, who have been given special training to deal with life-threatening conditions until an ambulance crew arrives. In Scotland the expectation is that at least half of patients will be reached in six minutes. In Wales, the target is that most patients are reached in eight minutes  - but having a defibrillator on scene and ready to use even if it is in the hands of a member of public counts as a response. The most immediately life-threatening calls are prioritised above all others by the ambulance services. And ambulances are automatically dispatched to the scene when one comes in. But control-room staff, such as Sue Hinton, who works for the West Midlands service, also step in to see if there are any other options if it looks like it will take some time to reach the patient. She likened it to a ""game of chess"", with crews stationed at different points in a region to give them the best chance of responding. ""You are constantly moving people around trying to get to the patients in the quickest time,"" she said. And rural areas were particularly ""challenging"" because of the distances involved, narrow roads and - when the weather was bad - the difficulty getting around. ""We utilise everything we have to get to patients as quickly as we can,"" Ms Hinton said And this included seeing if there were closer crews that could be diverted from other jobs as well as putting calls out to community first responders who may be closer to the scene and often know the areas better than ambulance crews. ""These trained volunteers are invaluable in rural areas,"" she added. It depends on how you cut the figures. BBC News analysed 586,000 emergency responses across more than 2,700 different postcode districts. About one in 10 callouts was to rural areas. There were 300 districts that had a very small numbers of critical cases, including some remote parts of Scotland where there was just one callout during the 10 months looked at. Some of these took over an hour to reach. There were 2,400 locations that had at least 10 callouts and a number of areas that waited over 20 minutes for a response. But to obtain a trustworthy response time for a local area, BBC News judged, there needed to have been at least 50 callouts over the time period - more than one a week. There were 2,000 locations with that level of demand. The single longest wait was seen in the NR23 postcode in and aroundWells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast, followed by RH14, in Chichester, Sussex. One former community responder in Wells-next-the-Sea told the BBC he resigned because of the length of time he was left with badly-injured patients before ambulance crews arrived. These waits also were longer than those in any district with more than 50 callouts in Wales or Scotland but the differences in the way response times are measured may be a factor in that. Ambulance services say they are expected to achieve the average target response times on a regional and national level only - not down to the super-local level looked at by BBC News. They also say there are other measures of performance, including the expectation that nine in 10 top-category callouts be reached within 15 minutes, that they perform better on. Nonetheless, ambulance chiefs accept they would like to do better. Anthony Marsh, who chairs the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the levels of demand and the remoteness of some areas presented ""challenging circumstances"" for the service. ""Our staff are working flat out to deal with record number of 999 calls, to reach all patients as quickly as they can whether they live in rural or urban areas,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly given the very rural nature of the majority of our country, there will be cases where we are longer to arrive than we would prefer."" Mr Marsh also pointed out control-room staff would, if needed, stay on the phone line to offer ""expert advice"" until help arrived. And he called on more members of the public to get trained in basic life support, so they would know what to do if faced with an emergency. Other steps are also being taken to improve the speed of responses. In some area,  police and fire crews have been enlisted and trained to respond to calls, while the BHF is in the process of working with ambulance services to map where defibrillators are - large numbers have been bought privately and are not registered on ambulance systems.

" The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead.

"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive.

"Cambridge University is to offer ""second chance"" places after A-level results for the first time this summer, in a deliberate bid to increase the number of disadvantaged students. There will be about 100 places available but only deprived students from the UK will be allowed to apply. The university has faced accusations of being socially exclusive. Cambridge says the scheme reflects its wish to recruit more disadvantaged youngsters - but it is not a ""quota"". The prestigious university has been attacked for a lack of diversity in its intake of about 3,500 undergraduates each year - such as too few students from poorer backgrounds or from deprived areas. Last week, BBC News revealedUK students had 500 fewer undergraduate places at Cambridge than a decade ago, while overseas student numbers had risen by 65%. In response, Cambridge has announced that it will give a second chance to about 100 disadvantaged youngsters currently at school in the UK. Plan revealed to cut fees to Â£7,500, but Brexit delay likely Shrinking number of UK students getting Oxbridge places revealed Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' These will be students who have already applied to the university but have been turned down in the main admissions process, who can now try to get a place after their exam results in the summer. It will use the ""adjustment"" process which runs alongside the clearing system after A-level results are published, which allows students with strong results to make a late change in their application. The places will depend on getting high exam results in the summer The type of disadvantage will include young people living in deprived areas, in places where few people go to university and who are at schools where few people have ever gained places at Cambridge or Oxford. Ethnicity will not be counted as a factor. Sir Peter Lampl,  who chairs the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said that Cambridge's plan for ""reserving places for disadvantaged young people"" was a ""step in the right direction"". But he said there was still a problem with many talented, poorer pupils not even applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or else having their exam grades under-predicted by their school. He said that the whole university admissions system should be changed so that all students ""apply only after they have received their A-level results"". Cambridge has been criticised for having a privileged intake - with figures recently showing thatonly 2% of students were white and working class. There have also been concerns that there aretoo few students from some ethnic minorities. About 2% of the intake for 2017-18 were black students. Cambridge says that its plan for reserved places in the summer is specifically about increasing the number of students from ""widening participation backgrounds"". The university says where these students, whose original applications were rejected, ""go on to achieve outstanding results, we want to open up the possibility for them to be reconsidered"". Rae Tooth, chief executive officer of the Villiers Park social mobility charity, backed the scheme but said universities ""need to become better at identifying and nurturing potential wherever it is"". She said: ""Results achieved by students from less advantaged backgrounds are not always reflective of their huge motivation or their ability. ""Often they face obstacles that are outside of their control and limit their potential."" Sam Lucy, Cambridge's director of admissions, said the university received more than 14,000 applications from the UK - and that some students might not have shown ""their full academic potential"" in applications and interviews. This new scheme would allow their applications ""to be reconsidered as soon as they have their final results"", with the prospect of places for those who achieved high results, she said. ""We hope this will have a positive impact in enabling us to admit talented students from under-represented groups who narrowly miss out in the first round,"" Ms Lucy added.

"Washington's ambassador to the UK has defended the US's approach to food hygiene and farming. Criticism of US food standards was ""designed to reduce not increase trade"", Woody Johnson told the BBC. US beef and chicken producers use processes not permitted in the EU, including rinsing chicken carcasses with chlorine. But Mr Johnson said the UK should accept American meat as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. ""To get a robust trade arrangement, that lifts all boats, it has to include farming and farm products,"" he said. Whether the UK should allow imports of US-produced beef and chicken after it leaves the EU is among the most contentious trade questions. He said Americans believed their food was ""cost-effective and humane"" and would have taken legal action if they felt there was anything wrong with the safety of their food. ""If I had my choice between chicken that was safe and clean and didn't have campylobacter material and poisons on it... I would take the one that had been cleaned sufficiently,"" he said. The ambassador defended the practice of treating meat with chlorinated water, telling the BBC that in the US, ""we have the lowest levels of food poisoning"". But it's difficult to find enough evidence to support this claim. The most common bacteria in chicken that cause food poisoning are campylobacter and salmonella. Astudy in the UK published in 2014,external, using data from 2009, estimated 280,000 cases of campylobacter or about 450 cases per 100,000 people. AUS study published in 2011,external, using data from 2002-2008 estimated 845,024 cases of campylobacter or about 300 cases per 100,000 people. For salmonella the US study estimated just over a million cases of salmonella a year - a rate of about 350 per 100,000 people. The UK study estimated that there were about 34,000 cases of salmonella from food per year or about 55 per 100,000 people. Both studies were government-commissioned and used lab reports as their basis but used different methodologies to scale up to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis. In short, it's very hard to compare. But theWorld Health Organization tried to estimate,externalglobal rates of sickness from food in 2015. Data used for the study suggests that the region containing the US, Cuba and Canada has a higher rate of salmonella but a lower rate of campylobacter than the region containing developed European countries including the UK. Correction: An earlier version of this story wrongly compared estimated cases in the US with confirmed cases in the UK. It was amended on 5 April to reflect estimated figures from both countries. Read more:How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK farmer organisations have argued that while US production methods are safe, animal welfare and environmental standards are lower than in the UK. Will a UK-US trade deal lower food standards in the UK? US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken Mr Johnson rejected that. ""American farmers care about their land and their animals as much as they do here. A lot of these statements are designed, perhaps by the EU, to create barriers to US farm products,"" he said. He said 90% of American farms were owned by families and cited his own mother, who he said continued to drive a tractor on the family's organic farm into her 90s. He added that he had confidence that whatever the outcome of Brexit, the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK would continue. ""Our relationship is more important than ever,"" he said.

"Hello Kitty appeared on the catwalk at last autumn's Paris fashion show Hello Kitty, whose image already appears on pyjamas, pencil cases, and the sides of buses, is to grace the big screen after the brand's owner signed the feline icon's first film deal. After five years of discussions, Sanrio, the Japanese firm which manages the character, has signed a deal with a unit of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema. The film's plot is not yet decided. ""A search for writers and creative talent will commence immediately,"" Sanrio said in a statement. The film will be made by Flynn Picture Company, the production company behind blockbuster films Rampage and Skyscraper, starring Dwayne Johnson. It will be produced by New Line Cinema, a unit of Warner Bros, responsible for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. Over the last 45 years, the mouthless cartoon cat adorned with trademark hair bow has generated billions of dollars. The simple line-drawn image has appeared on merchandise including clothing, toys and stationery, targeted mostly at young children, but also more recently popular with some adults. Hello Kitty-branded products are sold in 130 countries worldwide, with the range extending from prosecco to plimsolls. Hello Kitty is not actually a cat Hello Kitty bullet train unveiled in Japan The Japanese anime tackling workplace bullying Hello Kitty is also licensed for amusement parks and cafÃ©s, while last year a Japanese railway firm splashed the image on its bullet train, painted in pink and white. Although the brand typifies the Japanese trend for ""kawaii"" or cuteness, the character itself is identified as British, ""born in a suburb of London"", because when she was created in the 1970s, British culture was fashionable in Japan. She also has a twin sister, Mimmy. Sanrio said Hello Kitty's popularity was down to the ""heartfelt message of friendship"" the brand offered its fans. A statement from New Line Cinema said the firm was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore use of the ""timeless"" intellectual property. ""Hello Kitty and her friends have been part of our shared culture for decades and we look forward to exploring where her newest adventure will take her,"" it added.

"Iris scanning and facial recognition technology have been trialled to halt the prison drug supply Facial recognition and eye scanning have been deployed at prisons to prevent drug smuggling. The Ministry of Justice said the biometric scans for visitors were designed to help staff identify people bringing in contraband. At one prison, there were more ""no shows"" from visitors than usual after they learned the scans were being used. But prison campaigners said if families were deterred from visiting, then it would be ""counter-productive"". In the trials, facial recognition technology was used at HMP Humber; iris scanners at HMP Lindholme; and identity document verification at HMP Hull. Ministers considered the pilot programme ""successful"" and are considering how to roll out the technology more widely in prisons across England and Wales. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Last year prison staff across England and Wales seized more than 23,000 drug packages and mobile phones. Many methods were used to smuggle in the contraband, but intelligence work identified one trend in particular - prison visits. Over a six-week period in December and January, cameras scanned the faces of 770 visitors at HMP Humber, to spot if they were using false identities or making repeat trips to see different prisoners. Some visitors turned back after finding out facial matching software was in use. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""New technology is vital in our fight against the gangs that seek to cause chaos in prisons, and this biometric equipment has the potential to significantly aid our efforts."" He said that along with a prison officer recruitment drive, the technology would help to ""make prisons places of rehabilitation where offenders can turn their lives around"". It comes as the Prison Service struggles to stem the flow of the powerful synthetic drug Spice, blamed for outbreaks of violence, and illegal phones which are believed to be used to organise drug deliveries and intimidate witnesses. Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling The drug causing chaos in prison Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones The Ministry of Justice said that prison intelligence has identified a trend of visitors supplying banned items to inmates. But those responsible have proven difficult to track because they may be using false identity documents to gain access to the prison, it said. Some prisons use fingerprint technology, but many rely on physical ID documents such as driving licences. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said: ""If families and children are being deterred from visiting, that would be counterproductive. ""We need to see more of the evidence behind this apparent deterrent effect."" The campaign group Big Brother Watch, which has launcheda legal challenge to police plans to use automatic facial recognition in public places, said the prisons trial was a ""total shock"". It accused the government of taking an ""experimental approach to human rights"" by trying to win public acceptance for facial recognition cameras in controlled environments such as prisons, before it uses them as a general public surveillance tool.

The images were taken two days after talks between the leaders of the US and North Korea ended without them reaching a deal on denuclearisation. The Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing, never for ballistic missile launches. Work to dismantle it began last year but stopped as the US talks stalled. The pledge to dismantle ithad been seen as a confidence-building measure between Pyongyang and Washington. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Meanwhile, the US has warned North Korea could face yet more sanctions should Pyongyang not take steps to denuclearise. Satellite pictures show the site has been rebuilt The satellite evidence, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appears to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad at the Sohae site at Tongchang-ri. Images last July appeared to show the North had begun to dismantle the site. Sohae has been North Korea's main satellite launch facility since 2012. It has also been used for testing engines for missiles capable of reaching the US. But it has never been used for testing the ballistic missiles which have been considered so provocative. ""This distinction is important,"" Jenny Town,managing editor of monitoring group 38 North,external, told the BBC. ""The North Koreans likely see the rebuilding not as an active part of their missile programme, but of their civilian space programme - a distinction they have made repeatedly in the past,"" said Ms Town. She said the rebuilding of structures at the site could signal a lack of trust in the negotiations process. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul This is indeed worth watching and the rebuilding work does send a rather ominous signal. But I'm always cautious of extrapolating meaning from satellite images. We cannot make assumptions about what is being discussed in the corridors of power in Pyongyang based on building work at a remote satellite launch station. This renewed activity may be Pyongyang's way of prodding Washington, just a little reminder to the Trump administration that it has the technology to build weapons and it will not give that up easily. Most analysts believe it is more likely, at this stage, that Mr Kim is testing Mr Trump's boundaries and patience, rather than getting ready to test a ballistic missile. If North Korea did go further than rebuilding a rocket test stand, and broke its pledge to stop testing missiles, it would risk the wrath of an unpredictable US president. The impoverished state could be slapped with even more economic sanctions. Mr Kim has sold these denuclearisation talks at home, and is cultivating his statesman-like image abroad - is he really ready to put that all at risk? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended last week in Hanoi without any deal or agreement. A historic first meeting last June in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress. The Hanoi talks were all smiles but little results The two leaders were unable to agree on how far North Korea should progress with denuclearisation before it was granted some sanctions relief. In a television interview on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said North Korea could yet face more sanctions. He said Washington would continue to watch whether Pyongyang was committed to giving up its nuclear weapons programme ""and everything associated with it"". ""If they're not willing to do it, then I think President Trump has been very clear. They're not going to get relief from the crushing economic sanctions that have been imposed on them and we'll look at ramping those sanctions up in fact."" Observers, though, warn that adding fresh sanctions could completely stall the peace efforts. ""North Korea always reacts to the imposition of more sanctions in the same way: defiantly,"" Ms Town said. ""Imposing new sanctions now is only going to deflate whatever political will there may be to keep negotiating."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Trump-Kim summit: Who came out on top?

"2018's cold spring was partly to blame for an increase in potholes Firms that dig up the roads would have to guarantee they remained pothole-free for five years, under new Department for Transport (DfT) proposals. At the moment, utility companies only guarantee roadworks for two years. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Imposing higher standards on repairs will help keep roads pothole-free for longer."" But a utilities sector spokesperson said it was unnecessary to increase the guarantee. Street Works UK represents gas, electricity, water, sewage and telecoms companies. Chief executive, Clive Bairsto, said: ""The Government should not take forward proposals unless they are supported by a strong evidence base."" ""Utilities and their contractor partners play a vital role in delivering and maintaining vital infrastructure which powers the economy, and it is crucial that any new regulations are proportionate."" Companies that dig up the roads may have to guarantee the work for five years Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Potholes are the biggest enemy for road users and this Government is looking at all options to keep our roads in the best condition."" Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation said:  ""A five-year guarantee might cause the utility companies to sit up and take notice, but only if they believe local highway authorities will have the resource to monitor the state of repairs up to five years after they have been done."" The DfT is also proposing to allow innovative road surfacing techniques which could cut the number of potholes, such as asphalt with a high bitumen content. The pothole issue is rising up the political agenda, as the repair bill mounts. The government has said that last year's cold spring weather was at least partly to blame for an increase in the number of pothole problems. In October's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond promised an extra Â£420m for councils in England to deal with ""potholes, repair damaged roads, and invest in keeping bridges open and safe"". The Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) - whose members supply much of the materials used for filling in holes - claims one in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition andÂ£8bn is needed to carry out a one-time, thorough fix of potholes in England.,external The AA has called for learner drivers to have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the driving test.

"This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite The Home Office has been accused of ""complacency"" and shirking its responsibility in response to the Windrush scandal. A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the department had failed to ""take ownership"" of problems it had created. The scandal involved wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs"" experienced. PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""It is deeply regrettable that a scandal of this magnitude, on the back of repeated and unheeded warnings, does not appear to have fully shaken the Home Office out of its complacency about its systemic and cultural problems."" She said that ""there is a long way to go before the Home Office can credibly claim to have put things right"". The committee of MPs also criticised a decision to exclude up to 160,000 non-Caribbean Commonwealth cases from a review carried out to identify how many people may have been affected. A review of 11,800 Caribbean cases identified 164 who were removed or detained who might have been resident in the UK before 1973. But the report warned that the Windrush scandal concerned the entire Commonwealth and other cases could not be ""simply ignored"". Many of the new arrivals were children Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: 'Home Office ignored warnings' An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been called the Windrush generation, in reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The MPs' report condemned the department for failing to keep accurate records of people's immigration status and showing a ""lack of concern"" about the impact its policies had. It also said the Home Office had lacked ""any sense of urgency"" in its response to the scandal and took eight months to set up a hardship fund, adding that a compensation scheme is still not operating over a year since the problems were first exposed. A Home Office spokeswoman said a dedicated taskforce had helped thousands prove their status in the UK and had provided support to more than 600 people on issues including benefits and housing. She said the home secretary had also commissioned a review with independent oversight to establish what went wrong and prevent it happening again.

"This video can not be played Ex-Nissan boss leaves Tokyo jail in mask and orange braces Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has left prison in Japan on bail, more than three months after being arrested. A Tokyo court made the surprise decision to allow his release on Tuesday, setting bail at 1bn yen (Â£6.8m; $8.9m). Mr Ghosn has been charged with financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust, but denies wrongdoing. The 64-year-old left the detention centre surrounded by guards, wearing a cap and white medical face mask. He was also wearing overalls and orange, reflective braces, making him barely recognisable by comparison with the smart-suit, shirt-and-tie attire he sported when running a global carmaking empire with 470,000 employees, selling 10.6 million vehicles in 2017 from 122 factories. Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Ghosn says 'plot and treason' behind arrest Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Strict bail conditions for Mr Ghosn, including video surveillance and restricted use of his mobile phone, were set for his release. His computer access is restricted to his lawyer's office during weekday daytime hours. As the architect of the alliance between Nissan and French carmaker Renault, he brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. He then ran the alliance of the three global carmakers as both chief executive and chairman. He has saidhis arrestwas the result of a ""plot and treason"" against him - a bid by some Nissan executives wanting to stop his plan to integrate Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi. His previous requests for bail were rejected and his lengthy detention has drawn international criticism. His imminent release from the detention centre, where he has been held since his arrest on 19 November, was signalled by the arrival of a car from the Embassy of France. ""Carlos Ghosn is being released. He is a French citizen. He will be able to defend himself with greater ease. So much, the better,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. ""But my responsibility as finance and economy minister is to make sure that hundreds of thousands of jobs at Renault and at the Renault-Nissan alliance are protected,"" he added. Press members set up for Mr Ghosn's exit from prison Mr Ghosn was released after Japanese courts hadrejected two previous requests for bail, saying the Brazilian-born executive posed a flight risk and could conceal evidence. The latest bail request was filed by a new legal team. The case has attracted global attention and drawn criticism of Japan's criminal justice system, which allows for lengthy detention periods. It is the first time the businessman, previously hailed a hero in Japan for turning around the ailing Nissan, has been photographed in public since mid-November. He had looked visibly thinner when he appeared in court in January for the first time since his arrest. Courtroom sketch from his appearance in January His status was such that his life was serialised in a Japanese comic book. In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn came seventh, ahead of Barack Obama, who was placed ninth. Born in Porto Velho, Brazil, to Lebanese parents, he was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"". The allegations against him have received widespread media coverage in Japan and also forced changes at the carmakers. Renault, for instance, has altered its governance structure to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive.

"Goldman Sachs is relaxing its dress code, as the Wall Street giant moves toward a more casual workplace. The investment bank announced the ""firm-wide flexible dress code"" in an internal memo, urging employees to use ""good judgement"" in their fashion choices. Goldman Sachs loosened the dress code for its tech division in 2017, in a bid to appeal to top talent. Other banks like JP Morgan have taken similar steps. In a widely cited memo, the US bank said the ""changing nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment"" had prompted the move to a ""firm wide flexible dress code"". ""Casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgement in this regard,"" the memo read.

"The CondÃ©-sur-Sarthe prison in Normandy is one of France's most secure jails A prison inmate in northern France has seriously wounded two guards in a knife attack, in what French ministers have described as a ""terrorist incident"". MichaÃ«l Chiolo was later detained in a police operation carried out on Tuesday evening. He and his female partner, who was visiting him, had been barricaded in the family-visiting area of a Normandy high-security prison since the morning. Both were shot by police, and she is now said to have died of her wounds. One of the guards suffered a serious abdominal wound, while the second was slashed on the face and back, reports say. Chiolo shouted ""Allahu Akhbar"" (God is Greatest) during his attack, reports said. ""It was truly a murder attempt. There was blood everywhere. The family-visiting unit was a battle scene,"" a prison staff representative told AFP news agency. It is thought the ceramic knife Chiolo used might have been smuggled into the prison by his partner, Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said. Knife attacker in Marseille shot dead Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Chiolo, who was serving a 30-year sentence, reportedly became radicalised while in prison. He said he wanted to avenge the death of Cherif Chekatt, who carried out the Strasbourg shooting attack in December, Paris prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said on Tuesday night. The two men had previously spent 175 days in jail together, and then continued to correspond by mail, franceinfo reports on its website. Chiolo had been jailed for choking an 89-year-old man, whom he and an accomplice had tied up while burgling, to death. While in jail, he was sentenced to an extra year in prison for condoning terrorism. He had asked fellow inmates to ""re-enact"" the 2015 terror attack on the Bataclan music venue in Paris, which left 90 people dead.

"Iris scanning and facial recognition technology have been trialled to halt the prison drug supply Facial recognition and eye scanning have been deployed at prisons to prevent drug smuggling. The Ministry of Justice said the biometric scans for visitors were designed to help staff identify people bringing in contraband. At one prison, there were more ""no shows"" from visitors than usual after they learned the scans were being used. But prison campaigners said if families were deterred from visiting, then it would be ""counter-productive"". In the trials, facial recognition technology was used at HMP Humber; iris scanners at HMP Lindholme; and identity document verification at HMP Hull. Ministers considered the pilot programme ""successful"" and are considering how to roll out the technology more widely in prisons across England and Wales. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Last year prison staff across England and Wales seized more than 23,000 drug packages and mobile phones. Many methods were used to smuggle in the contraband, but intelligence work identified one trend in particular - prison visits. Over a six-week period in December and January, cameras scanned the faces of 770 visitors at HMP Humber, to spot if they were using false identities or making repeat trips to see different prisoners. Some visitors turned back after finding out facial matching software was in use. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""New technology is vital in our fight against the gangs that seek to cause chaos in prisons, and this biometric equipment has the potential to significantly aid our efforts."" He said that along with a prison officer recruitment drive, the technology would help to ""make prisons places of rehabilitation where offenders can turn their lives around"". It comes as the Prison Service struggles to stem the flow of the powerful synthetic drug Spice, blamed for outbreaks of violence, and illegal phones which are believed to be used to organise drug deliveries and intimidate witnesses. Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling The drug causing chaos in prison Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones The Ministry of Justice said that prison intelligence has identified a trend of visitors supplying banned items to inmates. But those responsible have proven difficult to track because they may be using false identity documents to gain access to the prison, it said. Some prisons use fingerprint technology, but many rely on physical ID documents such as driving licences. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform said: ""If families and children are being deterred from visiting, that would be counterproductive. ""We need to see more of the evidence behind this apparent deterrent effect."" The campaign group Big Brother Watch, which has launcheda legal challenge to police plans to use automatic facial recognition in public places, said the prisons trial was a ""total shock"". It accused the government of taking an ""experimental approach to human rights"" by trying to win public acceptance for facial recognition cameras in controlled environments such as prisons, before it uses them as a general public surveillance tool.

It comes as Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox emerged from their latest round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, as they seek to get legally-binding changes to the EU withdrawal agreement ahead of crunch Commons vote. Speaking after a meeting with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Sajid Javid has called for knife crime to be treated ""like a disease"" after meeting police chiefs from seven forces most affected by violent crime. The home secretary said he wanted a ""legal duty"" on government departments to help prevent serious violence. The talks followed a spate of fatal teenage stabbings which has prompted debate about falling police numbers. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would host a summit ""in the coming days"" to tackle knife crime. Both police funding and stop-and-search powers were discussed in Wednesday's meeting, Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want serious violence to be treated by all parts of government, all parts of the public sector, like a disease and I want us to tackle it the same way - everyone would come together."" Chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Sara Thornton said the discussions had been ""really constructive ""and highlighted the need for extra police officers. ""We've agreed that by the end of the week we'll set out the scale of the investment required,"" she said. Durham's Chief Constable, Mike Barton, said he was ""heartened"" by the meeting while the chief constable of Merseyside Police said the talks were ""very good"". 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' 'Treat knife crime like terrorism' The unit tackling knives Ahead of the meeting, spokespeople from a number of police bodies called for funding for more officers. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicksaid there was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. But Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". When asked for his view on the matter, Mr Javid said it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"", adding: ""We have to listen to them when they talk about resources."" The home secretary said government needed to listen to police concerns about resources Senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Wales, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire attended the meeting, as did representatives of the National Crime Agency and National Police Chiefs' Council. Earlier, Ms Thornton told BBC Breakfast that ""emergency funding"" was needed to tackle the problem. ""We need to have more officer hours on the streets,"" she said. ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? It comes after two 17-year-olds were killed in separate stabbings in London and Greater Manchester at the weekend. Jodie Chesney was killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki was stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. A 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murder of Yousef, Greater Manchester Police said. A second 17-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. Speaking about Yousef's death, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he supported an increase in the use of stop and search by police, even though it was ""controversial"". ""If there are more young people carrying knives, it follows there needs to be more people apprehended,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police saida man had been arrested in Leicester in connection with the murder of Jodie. Jodie's grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" In Lancashire,six people have been arrestedover a gang attack at a sixth form college.

Theresa May told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the killings of Jodie and Yousef were ""absolutely appalling"". Her official spokesman said the Home Office would co-ordinate an urgent series of ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work government was doing to support local councils and police. Mrs May said the problem would require ""a whole-of-government effort, in conjunction with the police, the wider public sector and local communities"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the prime minister for saying there was no direct link between the cut in police numbers and the increase in violent crime. In a video posted on Tuesday,external, he said young people ""shouldn't pay the price for austerity with their lives"". Police officer numbers in England and Wales havedropped by just under 20,000 since 2010,external, while levels of violent crime have risen in recent years. Figures released in February showed the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - 285 -was the highest since records began in 1946. But Donna Murray-Turner, who chairs the Croydon Safer Neighbourhood Board, does not believe more police officers will solve the issue. She told BBC Breakfast the problem of knife crime was ""far more complex and multi-layered than upping the numbers in police officers"" and called for greater ""community engagement"".

"David Sterling said cross-border trade could be a ""serious dilemma"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit Northern Ireland's chief civil servant has warned a no-deal Brexit could have ""grave"" consequences for the region. In a letter to Stormont's political parties, David Sterling comes close to suggesting there may have to be some hardening of the Irish border. He refers to a ""serious dilemma"" in finding a solution for trading agri-food products with the Irish Republic. A no-deal exit could have a ""profound and long-lasting impact"" on society in Northern Ireland, he added. Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: Your questions answered Some of the content is similar to aletter Mr Sterling sent to Whitehall departments in December. But in some areas the language has been toughened including a warning of a ""sharp increase in unemployment"". The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March. Brexit talks arecontinuing in Brussels to reach a breakthrough on the backstop. It is the insurance policy to maintain an open Irish border unless and until another solution is found. The most significant part of Mr Sterling's letter is a section dealing with cross-border trade. He writes that in event of no deal agri-food products from Northern Ireland could only continue to enter the Republic of Ireland if arrangements were put in place to collect tariffs and ""fulfil other regulatory obligations"". If new controls are not in place Mr Sterling said there would be no ""legal basis"" for this trade. He said this dilemma could only be resolved by a ""material shift in the fundamental position, including the statutory obligations, of one or more of the authorities"". In effect this means that unless the EU waived its usual rules, Northern Ireland produce would not be able to enter the Republic. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? The EU normally requires that food products from countries with which it does not have a deal have to enter through a border inspection post. The letter continues: ""In effect, there is currently no mitigation available for the severe consequences of a no-deal outcome. ""These consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply."" Democratic Unionist Party MP (DUP) Gavin Robinson said the civil service plans for dealing with Brexit ""should be taken forward by a functioning"" devolved government at Stormont. The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter split between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. ""Sinn FÃ©in walked away and like so many other areas they seem to prefer standing on the sidelines rather than engage in anything positive or productive,"" said Mr Robinson. Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the letter outlined how ""catastrophic"" a no-deal Brexit would be. And she said the DUP should ""start listening"" to the civil service and business and farming groups ""who are all warning about the disastrous impact"".

"GardaÃ­ released a photo of the other skull that has been recovered, alongside that of the Crusader The skull of an 800-year-old skeleton known as the Crusader, which was stolen from the crypt of an Irish church, has been found. Vandals decapitated the skeleton, which wasinterred beneath St Michan's Church in Dublin, during a break-in last week. On Tuesday, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) said they had recovered the skull along with another stolen from the crypt. The crypt is a popular tourist attraction but tours were cancelled after the break-in. A Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police force) spokesman told BBC News NI that the stolen skulls were recovered in Dublin but he would not give more details about the circumstances of the find. He merely said the items ""were recovered as a result of information that came into the possession of the investigating gardaÃ­"". The Crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed He added that National Museum of Ireland was ""acting in an advisory capacity"" during the recovery. St Michan's is a functioning church, which hosts regular Anglican services. Its crypt was badly damaged in last week's break-in and several of the mummies - including the 400-year-old remains of a nun - had been desecrated in the incident, according to the Church of Ireland. Crusaders fought in a series of religious wars known as the Crusades, which were sanctioned by the Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known of the crusades were campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. There were seven major crusades as well as many less significant ones. The Crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed. A solid steel internal gate was also stolen. After it was confirmed that the skulls had been found, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin Dr Michael Jackson said the emphasis would ""turn to consideration of future security and display of the remains in the crypt of St Michan's"". The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday He described the remains as ""a priceless part of the heritage of the city of Dublin and its citizens"", according to Irish national broadcaster RTÃ. The crypt was previously vandalised in 1996, when a group of teenagers broke in and took a number of mummified bodies from their coffins. At that time, the Irish Times reported that the intruders dragged the corpses on to the ground and ""seemed to be playing football with their heads"".

"Hospitals warning vital supplies might run out and operations would be cancelled, an ambulance service stockpiling tyres, and officials ""close to panic"" - these are recent stories about NHS efforts to plan for the possible consequences of the UK leaving the European Union with no agreement in place at the end of March. So, should patients be worried? There are two answers. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports caused by traffic chaos near the Channel ports. The Whitehall line is that everything that can be done is being done. But the other point being made is this is an unprecedented scenario - and nobody can be sure what will happen if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. There is a tension at the heart of NHS no-deal planning. On the one hand, there is a need to reassure the public and avoid panic stockpiling of medicines, which would simply exacerbate supply shortages. But on the other, senior hospital executives need to identify the risks to their organisations and patient care and warn of any gaps in planning. Brexit halt to blood donor sessions amid traffic fears reversed Pharmacists warn of a 'surge' in shortage of common medicines Brexit: Is NHS already finding it hard to get medicines? Brexit: NHS managers warn about impact of no deal A board paper at a leading hospital trust,revealed by BBC News, sets out in stark terms what might happen in a chaotic no-deal scenario. In it, Dr David Rosser, chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham Trust, says: ""By far the greatest concern is the availability of medicines, devices and clinical supplies."" He questions the reassurances from the government and says trusts still don't know which products are at risk. Trusts, he says, could ""quickly run out of vital medical supplies"". There are fears some medication might be in short supply Dr Rosser makes the point that complex surgery on a patient does not begin until thorough checks are made on the right supplies and equipment being available. But the checks applied in the operating theatres do not, he says, cover post-operative care, during which medicines might not be obtainable. And there would, therefore, have to be widespread cancellations of non-urgent operations. The Birmingham memo has emerged days after news of a discussion about a no-deal Brexit at a board meeting of University College London Hospitals Trust was revealed in the Evening Standard. At this meeting, the chief executive, Prof Marcel Levi, told colleagues the tone from government and NHS officials had changed completely in recent weeks. And words of reassurance had been replaced by ""almost daily communications which are very close to panic"". Meanwhile, it has also emerged that separate papers, for the London Ambulance Service board, include a reference to preparing for ""potential disruption following the UK's exit from the EU"". And this includes stockpiling fuel and tyres and ""discussions with the militaryâ¦ to establish support if required in the event of political unrest"". Ministers and NHS leaders, meanwhile, say they already have robust contingency plans for a difficult no-deal Brexit scenario: A six-week stockpile of essential medicines has been built up by pharmaceutical companies in the UK A plane has been chartered to fly in drugs that can't be stockpiled. Warehouses with refrigeration capacity have been rented Ports other than Dover and Folkestone are being prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies And NHS officials say they have completed an exhaustive analysis of drugs that might be affected by supply disruption. A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are working closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to make detailed plans to ensure continued access to healthcare, medical devices and clinical supplies in the event of no deal."" But clearly hospital managers are not totally convinced that national level contingency planning as currently described is sufficient. The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said: ""Trusts are following advice from government closely - but at this stage, they urgently need more clarity. ""A disorderly Brexit could pose a risk to the supply of medicines and equipment. ""There would also be implications for staffing across vital health and care roles."" Ministers have a tricky balance to find. Patients need reassuring that stockpiles are in place to ensure their medication will be obtainable. But hospital managers have to be helped to cover every eventuality that might threaten patient safety. As long as no deal is agreed and 29 March draws closer, this balancing act will become harder to achieve.

"The UK government may cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods in the event of a no-deal Brexit, reports say. Some tariffs would be scrapped completely, including those on car parts, and some agricultural produce. However, 10-20% of key products would continue to be protected by the current level of tariffs, including some textiles, cars, beef, lamb and dairy. The government said it would make an announcement once a decision had been finalised. Tariffs are taxes on imports which protect UK companies from overseas competition. UK to keep trade penalties post-Brexit UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection Many supporters of Brexit argue that tariffs on food and other items should be scrapped in order to lower prices for consumers. But farmers fear that cheap imports and lower standards would destroy many parts of British agriculture. Similar concerns have been expressed in other sectors of the economy, and many business leaders fear the government could be tempted to cut tariffs at their expense. The plans for widespread cuts in tariffs were first reported by Sky News,external. Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new tariff schedules would be published only after next week's Commons vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal if it became clear the UK would be leaving the EU without a deal. The changes would have ""big implications"" for some sectors, he said. ""We have been consulting with different industry sectors on this. It has big implications for different sectors. Ceramics is an industry that I know very well. It has been subject to very unfair competition, to dumping of very cheap ceramic exports from the Far East, from China."" The Department for International Trade said that no final decision had been taken on tariffs, but there had been discussion across government about the right level in the even of a no-deal. ""If we leave the European Union without an agreement, our tariffs will need to strike a balance between protecting consumers and businesses from possible price rises and avoiding the exposure of sensitive industries to competition."" Appearing before the International Trade Select Committee Liam Fox declined to comment on the reports. He said: ""The government will set out what it believes to be the correct tariffs if indeed we get to a no-deal scenario."" The international trade secretary also said there were a ""number of ways"" to reduce the impact of low tariffs on industries such as farming and manufacturing which may benefit from their protection. He did not lay out a specific plan. Last month, Environment Secretary Michael Gove promised farmers that the government would apply tariffs to food imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, to provide ""specific and robust protections"" for farmers. ""Your concerns have absolutely been heard,"" Mr Gove told a conference of the National Farmers' Union (NFU). ""It will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on food products. ""There will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production."" Tariffs perform two functions: to protect businesses from competition from abroad - and to raise money for governments. However, these charges also spell higher prices for consumers. By cutting tariffs on the majority of imports, the government would be giving consumers a helping hand. While areas such as farming would benefit from the protection of tariffs, dropping them elsewhere would leave other UK businesses disadvantaged relative to their European competitors. That may weigh on politicians' minds, as the Prime Minister tries to rustle up last minute support for her deal. In global terms, cutting the majority of tariffs would be a hugely bold move: it would send out the message that the UK is freeing up trade and is open for business UK to keep trade penalties post-Brexit UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection Brexit doubts leave firms 'hung out to dry' No-deal Brexit threat to 40 trade deals What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

"Whether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS. From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more. The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port. The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs. Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry. Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He even suggestedthe public may have to stockpile drugs themselves. The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse. Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"". The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe. The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year. Nicola Sturgeon urges answers on how much Brexit will cost the NHS NHS managers warn about impact of no deal The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' There are other related factors too. The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK. That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service. The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training. About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved. And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care. Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU. They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that. The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments. The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them. Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance. Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU. The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research. The government is also increasing its spending on research and development. Medical research concern over Brexit Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK. The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services. The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn. Its report,externalfound migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it. The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said. The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10. It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by Â£20bn by 2023. On top of that, about Â£4bn will be given to the rest of the UK. That amounts to more than the promised Â£350m a week. Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the Â£39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards? Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed. Who gets social care and who pays for it?

"The group representing hospitals and ambulance services in England has warned of a lack of ""contingency planning"" to deal with the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the health service. In a leaked email to NHS England boss Simon Stevens, NHS Providers says leaving the EU without agreement would immediately be a real risk to services. The group warns it would make it harder to stop the spread of diseases. NHS England said preparing for every possible Brexit outcome was a priority. The Department of Health said it was confident of reaching a Brexit deal that benefits the NHS but was preparing for ""the unlikely event of no-deal"", to prevent disruption to patients. It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab holds the latest round of negotiations with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier. NHS plans 'extensively' for no-deal Brexit Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 and the two sides are currently negotiating the terms of its exit and its future relations in a whole range of issues. NHS Providers - which represents acute, ambulance, community and mental health services within the health service - has expressed concern about what it says is a lack of engagement with ministers in the email, seen by the BBC. It has called for NHS England and NHS Improvement - which oversees NHS trusts and providers - to convene a group of trust leaders as a matter of urgency. In an email sent to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, also copied in to Mr Raab and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, it calls for a co-ordinated response to confront the challenges that would be presented by a no deal. Chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson writes that there has been ""no formal communication"" to trusts from either NHS England or NHS Improvement on this issue. Without national planning and coordination ""there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices"", Mr Hopson says. He adds that ""disease control coordination could also suffer"". NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said ""a large degree of chaos"" was ""implicit"" in a no-deal Brexit and, without a transitional agreement with the EU, it was difficult to predict the impact on supply of medicines. ""There's obviously been talk of stockpiling. There's been talk in some cases of chartered flights to bring over supplies that maybe don't have such a long shelf-life. And although that's drastic action, it's probably quite justified,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. An NHS England spokeswoman said the health service was working with government, planning for different post-Brexit scenarios. ""We will be working with our colleagues and partners across the NHS to ensure plans are well progressed, and will provide the NHS with the support it needs,"" she said. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who supports the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said the NHS letter was a ""stark and urgent warning of the impact of a hard Brexit or no deal and of non-existent planning"". Another supporter of the campaign, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, said another referendum would be like seeking ""informed consent"" from a patient before a major operation. A series of technical notices - including advice for businesses, citizens and public bodies about a no-deal scenario - will be made public over the next month or so. Downing Street has described the advice due on Thursday as ""sensible, proportionate, and part of a common sense approach to ensure stability, whatever the outcome of talks"". On the same day, Mr Raab will make a speech in Westminster to outline the government's plans for the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. The UK is seeking ""associate membership"" of the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU's single market.

"Yousef Makki was stabbed in Altrincham on Saturday A teenager has been charged with the murder of a 17-year-old boy who was stabbed to death in Greater Manchester. Yousef Makki, from Burnage, died after being attacked in Gorse Bank Road, Hale Barns, near Altrincham, on Saturday. A 17-year-old boy has been charged with murder and possession of a bladed article. Another boy, 17, has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article. The pair are due to appear at Manchester Youth Court on Wednesday. Yousef's parents described him as a ""loving and caring son and brother"", and said he had phoned hours before his death to say he would be home for tea. ""The next knock at the door [was] officers with the tragic news... it is every parent's worst nightmare,"" they said. In their tribute, Yousef's family said he was a sporty and a dedicated student. ""We are absolutely devastated and cannot believe that our son has gone. This senseless loss has affected the whole community,"" they said. Flowers were placed in memory of Yousef Makki outside his school Manchester Grammar School, where Yousef was studying for his A-levels, said his death was a ""tragic loss"" and he was a ""dearly loved, incredibly bright pupil"". He is thought to have won a scholarship to attend the Â£12,000 a year independent school and dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon. A two-minute silence was held on Monday by pupils and staff at the school. Floral tributes have been left on the treet where Yousef was found injured. The fatal stabbing camea day after 17-year-old Jodie Chesneywas killed in a knife attack in a London park. A recent spate of killings across the country have sparked a national debate about ways to tackle knife crime. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was ""no direct correlation"" between falling police numbers and a rise in violent crime. However,Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick disagreed, saying there was ""some link"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid has saidthere is ""no single solution"" to tackling knife crime.

"GardaÃ­ released a photo of the other skull that has been recovered, alongside that of the Crusader The skull of an 800-year-old skeleton known as the Crusader, which was stolen from the crypt of an Irish church, has been found. Vandals decapitated the skeleton, which wasinterred beneath St Michan's Church in Dublin, during a break-in last week. On Tuesday, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) said they had recovered the skull along with another stolen from the crypt. The crypt is a popular tourist attraction but tours were cancelled after the break-in. A Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police force) spokesman told BBC News NI that the stolen skulls were recovered in Dublin but he would not give more details about the circumstances of the find. He merely said the items ""were recovered as a result of information that came into the possession of the investigating gardaÃ­"". The Crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed He added that National Museum of Ireland was ""acting in an advisory capacity"" during the recovery. St Michan's is a functioning church, which hosts regular Anglican services. Its crypt was badly damaged in last week's break-in and several of the mummies - including the 400-year-old remains of a nun - had been desecrated in the incident, according to the Church of Ireland. Crusaders fought in a series of religious wars known as the Crusades, which were sanctioned by the Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known of the crusades were campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. There were seven major crusades as well as many less significant ones. The Crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed. A solid steel internal gate was also stolen. After it was confirmed that the skulls had been found, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin Dr Michael Jackson said the emphasis would ""turn to consideration of future security and display of the remains in the crypt of St Michan's"". The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday He described the remains as ""a priceless part of the heritage of the city of Dublin and its citizens"", according to Irish national broadcaster RTÃ. The crypt was previously vandalised in 1996, when a group of teenagers broke in and took a number of mummified bodies from their coffins. At that time, the Irish Times reported that the intruders dragged the corpses on to the ground and ""seemed to be playing football with their heads"".

Brexit: NHS managers warn about impact of no deal A board paper at a leading hospital trust,revealed by BBC News, sets out in stark terms what might happen in a chaotic no-deal scenario. In it, Dr David Rosser, chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham Trust, says: ""By far the greatest concern is the availability of medicines, devices and clinical supplies."" He questions the reassurances from the government and says trusts still don't know which products are at risk. Trusts, he says, could ""quickly run out of vital medical supplies"". There are fears some medication might be in short supply Dr Rosser makes the point that complex surgery on a patient does not begin until thorough checks are made on the right supplies and equipment being available. But the checks applied in the operating theatres do not, he says, cover post-operative care, during which medicines might not be obtainable. And there would, therefore, have to be widespread cancellations of non-urgent operations. The Birmingham memo has emerged days after news of a discussion about a no-deal Brexit at a board meeting of University College London Hospitals Trust was revealed in the Evening Standard. At this meeting, the chief executive, Prof Marcel Levi, told colleagues the tone from government and NHS officials had changed completely in recent weeks. And words of reassurance had been replaced by ""almost daily communications which are very close to panic"". Meanwhile, it has also emerged that separate papers, for the London Ambulance Service board, include a reference to preparing for ""potential disruption following the UK's exit from the EU"". And this includes stockpiling fuel and tyres and ""discussions with the militaryâ¦ to establish support if required in the event of political unrest"". Ministers and NHS leaders, meanwhile, say they already have robust contingency plans for a difficult no-deal Brexit scenario: A six-week stockpile of essential medicines has been built up by pharmaceutical companies in the UK A plane has been chartered to fly in drugs that can't be stockpiled. Warehouses with refrigeration capacity have been rented Ports other than Dover and Folkestone are being prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies And NHS officials say they have completed an exhaustive analysis of drugs that might be affected by supply disruption. A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are working closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to make detailed plans to ensure continued access to healthcare, medical devices and clinical supplies in the event of no deal."" But clearly hospital managers are not totally convinced that national level contingency planning as currently described is sufficient. The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said: ""Trusts are following advice from government closely - but at this stage, they urgently need more clarity. ""A disorderly Brexit could pose a risk to the supply of medicines and equipment. ""There would also be implications for staffing across vital health and care roles."" Ministers have a tricky balance to find. Patients need reassuring that stockpiles are in place to ensure their medication will be obtainable. But hospital managers have to be helped to cover every eventuality that might threaten patient safety. As long as no deal is agreed and 29 March draws closer, this balancing act will become harder to achieve.

"Whether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS. From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more. The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port. The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs. Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry. Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He even suggestedthe public may have to stockpile drugs themselves. The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse. Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"". The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe. The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year. Nicola Sturgeon urges answers on how much Brexit will cost the NHS NHS managers warn about impact of no deal The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' There are other related factors too. The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK. That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service. The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training. About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved. And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care. Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU. They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that. The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments. The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them. Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance. Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU. The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research. The government is also increasing its spending on research and development. Medical research concern over Brexit Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK. The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services. The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn. Its report,externalfound migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it. The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said. The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10. It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by Â£20bn by 2023. On top of that, about Â£4bn will be given to the rest of the UK. That amounts to more than the promised Â£350m a week. Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the Â£39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards? Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed. Who gets social care and who pays for it?

"This video can not be played Specialist paramedics are trying to free up ambulance crews in Lincolnshire The most critically injured patients in rural areas are at risk due to the time it takes the ambulance service to reach them, a BBC investigation has found. Some rural communities wait more than 20 minutes on average for 999 crews or trained members of the community to get to immediately life-threatening cases like cardiac arrests and stab victims. A response should come in six to eight minutes, depending on where you live. Experts said delays could make the difference between life and death. This was particularly the case for cardiac arrests where ""every second counts"", the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said.

Source: Ambulance trusts. Data is shown for postcode districts with more than nine highest category callouts in January-October 2018. Districts with 10-49 callouts are labelled ""low numbers"". Northern Ireland does not use comparable categorisation. Click here if you cannot see the interactive map,external Wells-next-the-Sea has longest wait for ambulances Ambulance bosses accepted some responses took longer than they should but said staff were working hard in ""challenging circumstances"" due to the levels of demand and the remote nature of some locations. They said expert advice was provided over the phone until a response arrived. Using the Freedom of Information Act, BBC News has obtained the average response times for the most life-threatening callouts in more than 2,700 local communities across Britain. These times cover the point at which a trained person reaches the patient - so it could be an ambulance or volunteers trained by the service to respond to these highest-priority cases. These calls include: cardiac arrests stab wounds major blood loss seizures patients not breathing or struggling to breathe women in the end stages of labour They represent about one in 20 emergency cases the ambulance service deals with, and are prioritised above all others because of the risk to life. The BBC News investigation shows there are some rural areas in Britain where it took over 20 minutes on average for the ambulance service to reach a patient during January to October last year. That compares with responses in under five minutes in a number of town and city neighbourhoods. Across all the communities in Britain, the average response time for rural areas was 11 minutes 13 seconds - more than 50% longer than the seven minutes 14 seconds it takes in urban areas. Northern Ireland categorises emergency calls differently to England, Wales and Scotland. Every moment counts for these patients - none more so than the cardiac arrest cases. Research has shown that if patients are given all the treatment immediately, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation - an electric shock to restart the heart, about two-thirds can survive. But every minute delay reduces survival by 10%. And this is one of the reasons why there has been a big emphasis on putting defibrillators in community settings and encouraging people to learn how to do CPR. Judy O'Sullivan, of the BHF, said it was ""critical"" that expert help from the ambulance services arrived as ""quickly as possible"". But she said CPR from ordinary members of the public was also vital - in the UK, this happens in less than half of cardiac arrests that occur out of hospital. ""When someone has a cardiac arrest, every second counts,"" Ms O'Sullivan added. There are different targets depending on where you live in the UK. In England, ambulance services are expected to reach patients within an average of seven minutes. That has to be a ""trained response"" - but this can include community first responders, who can be members of the public and off-duty health professionals, who have been given special training to deal with life-threatening conditions until an ambulance crew arrives. In Scotland the expectation is that at least half of patients will be reached in six minutes. In Wales, the target is that most patients are reached in eight minutes  - but having a defibrillator on scene and ready to use even if it is in the hands of a member of public counts as a response. The most immediately life-threatening calls are prioritised above all others by the ambulance services. And ambulances are automatically dispatched to the scene when one comes in. But control-room staff, such as Sue Hinton, who works for the West Midlands service, also step in to see if there are any other options if it looks like it will take some time to reach the patient. She likened it to a ""game of chess"", with crews stationed at different points in a region to give them the best chance of responding. ""You are constantly moving people around trying to get to the patients in the quickest time,"" she said. And rural areas were particularly ""challenging"" because of the distances involved, narrow roads and - when the weather was bad - the difficulty getting around. ""We utilise everything we have to get to patients as quickly as we can,"" Ms Hinton said And this included seeing if there were closer crews that could be diverted from other jobs as well as putting calls out to community first responders who may be closer to the scene and often know the areas better than ambulance crews. ""These trained volunteers are invaluable in rural areas,"" she added. It depends on how you cut the figures. BBC News analysed 586,000 emergency responses across more than 2,700 different postcode districts. About one in 10 callouts was to rural areas. There were 300 districts that had a very small numbers of critical cases, including some remote parts of Scotland where there was just one callout during the 10 months looked at. Some of these took over an hour to reach. There were 2,400 locations that had at least 10 callouts and a number of areas that waited over 20 minutes for a response. But to obtain a trustworthy response time for a local area, BBC News judged, there needed to have been at least 50 callouts over the time period - more than one a week. There were 2,000 locations with that level of demand. The single longest wait was seen in the NR23 postcode in and aroundWells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast, followed by RH14, in Chichester, Sussex. One former community responder in Wells-next-the-Sea told the BBC he resigned because of the length of time he was left with badly-injured patients before ambulance crews arrived. These waits also were longer than those in any district with more than 50 callouts in Wales or Scotland but the differences in the way response times are measured may be a factor in that. Ambulance services say they are expected to achieve the average target response times on a regional and national level only - not down to the super-local level looked at by BBC News. They also say there are other measures of performance, including the expectation that nine in 10 top-category callouts be reached within 15 minutes, that they perform better on. Nonetheless, ambulance chiefs accept they would like to do better. Anthony Marsh, who chairs the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the levels of demand and the remoteness of some areas presented ""challenging circumstances"" for the service. ""Our staff are working flat out to deal with record number of 999 calls, to reach all patients as quickly as they can whether they live in rural or urban areas,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly given the very rural nature of the majority of our country, there will be cases where we are longer to arrive than we would prefer."" Mr Marsh also pointed out control-room staff would, if needed, stay on the phone line to offer ""expert advice"" until help arrived. And he called on more members of the public to get trained in basic life support, so they would know what to do if faced with an emergency. Other steps are also being taken to improve the speed of responses. In some area,  police and fire crews have been enlisted and trained to respond to calls, while the BHF is in the process of working with ambulance services to map where defibrillators are - large numbers have been bought privately and are not registered on ambulance systems.

"Mr Prasek had previously clashed with local authorities over the big cat, which he bought in 2016 A man has been mauled to death by a lion caged at his family home in the eastern Czech Republic. Michal Prasek owned the nine-year-old big cat and another lioness for breeding, reportedly drawing concern from local residents. Mr Prasek's father found his body in the lion's cage and told local media it had been locked from the inside. The animals - living in separate pens - were shot dead by police called to the scene. A police spokesperson told local media that the shootings were ""absolutely necessary for them to get to the man"". Why lion cubs are turning up across Europe Mr Prasek, 33, bought the lion in 2016 and the lioness last year, and kept them both in home-made enclosures in his back yard in the village of Zdechov. He had previously been denied planning permission to build the pens, and was subsequently fined for illegal breeding. But his conflict with the authorities reached a stalemate after he refused to let anyone onto his property. A lack of alternative facilities in the Czech Republic, or any evidence of animal cruelty, also meant the lions could not be forcibly removed. Mr Prasek made headlines last summer after a cyclist collided with the lioness as he was taking her for a walk on a leash. After intervention by police, the incident was deemed a traffic accident. ""Today's incident will perhaps finally help to resolve this long-term problem,"" said Zdechov mayor Tomas Kocourek.
