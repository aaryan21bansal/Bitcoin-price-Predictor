"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

"Scotland should not have food products ""forced"" on it because of the easing of regulations around gene editing, a government minister has said. The UK government has introduced a Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill which would set different rules from the EU following Brexit. It had asked Holyrood ministersto consider allowing gene-edited crops to be grown in Scotland. But the idea has been dismissed by environment secretary Mairi McAllan. She has written to UK environment secretary George Eustice and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, saying Scotland would not make the same changes as England if the bill passed. Ms McAllan said the Scottish government ""will not accept any constraint on the exercise of its devolved powers to set standards within devolved policy areas"". Gene editing allows scientists to change a plant or animal's DNA. Scientists can engineer crops that are more disease or drought resistant, without adding genetic material from another species. Cross-border dispute over gene-edited crops Gene-edited tomatoes could soon be sold in England Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Under the UK's internal market act, anything approved for sale in one part of the UK must be available across the whole of the UK. Tomatoes developed by scientists in Norwichto produce high amounts of vitamin D could be among the first gene-edited produce to go on sale. However, Scotland and Wales could potentially use their powers to restrict the use of genetically edited produce. In her letter, Ms McAllan said: ""If the UK government is determined to press ahead with this legislation, it must take steps to ensure that its revisions to the definition of a GMO (genetically modified organism) do not force products on Scotland which do not meet standards here without the consent of the Scottish Parliament."" Gene-edited tomatoes that boost vitamin D are among the foods that could be commercially developed She also raised concerns about the impact of the bill on Scotland's food exports to the EU. ""As your impact assessment for the Genetic Technologies (Precision Breeding) Bill acknowledges, removing gene-edited products from England's GM regulatory regime would mean divergence from the EU approach and as such could have implications for compliance costs and future trade,"" she wrote. ""The impact assessment also raises the prospect that new trade barriers could come in the form of checks and certification requirements on UK food exports entering the EU's single market. ""It states that this would not only affect products exported to the EU which contain precision-bred plant material, but also those in the same product categories which do not."" In turning down the UK government's offer to include Scotland in its gene editing scheme, the Scottish government is not saying ""never"". Its preference is to wait for an EU-wide review of the technology, rather than to press ahead, with England, using the policy-making freedom that Brexit allows. That is partly political - SNP ministers opposed Brexit and want to stay closely aligned to EU rules in the hope Scotland can one day rejoin the union as an independent country. There's also a more practical consideration - that divergence could lead to new trade barriers with the European single market if it wants to keep gene-edited produce out. The constitutional flashpoint is the operation of UK single market rules that mean any gene-edited produce approved in England must automatically be allowed into the Scottish market. Holyrood ministers hate how that could cut across their powers to regulate what's suitable for sale and are seeking an exemption, without saying what action they might take if they don't get one. Gene editing is supported by the National Farmers Union (NFU) in Scotland but Scottish ministers have consistently railed against it, aiming to keep as close as it can to EU regulations. However, the EU has recently launched a consultation on bringing forward similar legislation for plants, food and feed produced from new genomic technologies. UK cabinet minister George Eustice previously wrote to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, saying the new bill provided ""the opportunity to make the UK the best place in the world to invest in Agritech innovation"". He said: ""Outside the EU we are free to follow the science. ""These precision technologies allow us to speed up the breeding of plants that have natural resistance to diseases and better use of soil nutrients so we can have higher yields with fewer pesticides and fertilisers. ""The UK has some incredible academic centres of excellence and they are poised to lead the way.""

"The assault has re-ignited debate about gender violence in China Nine people have been arrested in China after a video went viral of a brutal attack by a group of men on women in the city of Tangshan, police say. It has led to an outcry on social media and re-ignited debate about gender violence in China. The incident began when a man put his hand on a woman's back in a restaurant and she pushed him away. The man is seen striking her before others drag her outside and continue attacking as she lies on the floor. The group of men are also seen attacking her dining partners. Two of the women were admitted to hospital and were in a ""stable condition and not in mortal danger"", while two others sustained minor injuries, officials said. Police in Tangshan, in northern Hebei province, said they had arrested nine people on suspicion of violent assault and ""provoking trouble"". The attack dominated discussion on Chinese social media on Saturday, taking up the top six places of Weibo's most-discussed topics. State television called for the suspects to be severely punished. ""All of this could happen to me, could happen to any of us,"" said one commenter in a post liked over 100,000 times. ""How is this sort of thing still happening in 2022?"" wrote another. ""Please give them criminal sentences, and don't let any of them get away."" The #MeToo icon China is trying to silence A widely shared WeChat post took issue with the initial official framing of the attack as a simple act of violence. ""This happened in a society where violence against women is rampant,"" the anonymous post said. ""To ignore and suppress the perspective of gender is to deny the violence that people - as women - suffer."" By Kerry Allen, Chinese Media Analyst Acts of violence against women are frighteningly common in China. Ten years ago, while I was living in the country, I witnessed on multiple occasions men assaulting their partners in broad daylight. It was common to see groups of bystanders simply watching on. Historically, many have viewed such incidents as being a private matter between a couple. Some have feared involving themselves, either for their own personal safety or because they're afraid of being implicated in a crime. China only made domestic violence punishable by law in March 2016. Before 2001, physical abuse was not even grounds for divorce. Even though sexual violence has become more prosecutable, the atmosphere on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo is despondent. Many feel the outcome of this case will be a light sentence and a small fine. In recent years, women have had little success in holding sexual harassment or assault to account. Few cases have been ruled in the victim's favour unless they have footage to support it, and China's persistent lockdowns over the last two years have exacerbated domestic attacks.

"The fire has badly damaged the pub, with most of the roof destroyed A pub part-owned by England and Nottinghamshire cricketer Stuart Broad has been badly damaged by a fire. Firefighters were called to the Tap and Run in the village of Upper Broughton, on the border of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, at about 03:20 BST. The roof and first floor of the pub - which is also owned by former cricketer Harry Gurney - have been destroyed. The owners said they were ""devastated"" and the fire service said the cause was believed to have been accidental. The cricketers thanked the public for their support and promised the pub would open again No-one was injured and the fire service said the road outside had reopened just after 13:00. In a statement, Broad and Gurney said: ""We are devastated to announce that due to a significant fire in the early hours of June 11th The Tap & Run will not be trading for the foreseeable future. ""We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the outpouring of support. ""And finally... we will be back! Watch this space."" Allow Twitter content?

"Australia has announced a â¬555m ($585m; Â£475m) settlement with France's Naval Group as compensation for scuppering a submarine contract with Paris. Australia angered France last year by suddenly cancelling a â¬35bn deal to build a fleet of submarines. Instead, it chose tobuild nuclear-powered submarines with US and UK technology- the so-called Aukus deal. The settlement draws a line under a bitter row that threatened to torpedo EU-Australia trade agreement talks. Anthony Albanese,who became Australia's prime minister last month, said it was a ""fair and an equitable settlement"". He added that he would travel to France soon to ""reset"" a relationship beset by ""pretty obvious"" tensions. French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said the settlement ""permits us to turn a page in our bilateral relations with Australia and look to the future"". What is Aukus?It's a security pact between Australia, the US and UK. It allows for greater sharing of intelligence, but crucially it gives Australia secret technology to build nuclear-powered submarines, though not equipped with nuclear weapons What's the aim?Aukus is widely seen as a response to the growing power of China, and an effort to counter its influence in the contested South China Sea Why did it anger France?Australia cancelled a US$37bn (A$52bn; Â£27bn; â¬35bn) deal with a French company building diesel-powered submarines, and, what's more, France - a traditional Western ally - found out about the new pact only a few hours before the public announcement The agreement between Australia, the US and UK will see Canberra being given the technology to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea. The pact will also cover artificial intelligence and other technologies in what analysts say is one of the countries' biggest defence partnerships in decades. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific Australian PM rejects 'slurs' from France amid row US-UK face backlash over defence deal But the decision by Australia to end its submarine contract with France drew fury from Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron accusing Australia's former PM Scott Morrison of lying, and recalling his ambassador from Australia in protest. Relations between the two countries were on ice until last month when Australia elected centre-left leader Mr Albanese - the first Labor leader to come to power in more than a decade. ""We are re-establishing a better relationship between Australia and France,"" Mr Albanese said, after speaking to Mr Macron about the settlement. ""I'm looking forward to taking up president Macron's invitation to me to visit Paris at the earliest opportunity."" Mr Albanese added that the failed French submarine contract will have cost Australian taxpayers A$3.4bn (US$2.4bn; â¬2.28bn) with almost nothing to show for it. Meanwhile, Mr Albanese's government has also made tentative steps to conduct ministerial-level talks with China after a range of political and trade disputes between the countries. Relations went into decline after Australia called for a probe into the origins of coronavirus and banned Chinese firm Huawei from building its 5G network. Speaking in Singapore on Saturday, Defence Minister Richard Marles said Australia wanted ""respectful"" relations with all countries in the region, adding: ""This includes China."" ""Australia values a productive relationship with China. China is not going anywhere. And we all need to live together and, hopefully, prosper together,"" he said. China has previously accused Australia, the US and UK of having a ""Cold War mentality"" over the Aukus agreement.

Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk.

In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West.

a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"""That's a good deal but I can't have them,"" Safina Kassu says, inspecting the oranges at her local Aldi supermarket. A bag of five is reduced from Â£1.09 to 95p - a bargain, she says. But Safina wants to buy avocados and says she hasn't got the budget for both. The entrepreneur keeps hundreds of retail prices in her head - she knows exactly what a bottle of Coke, a box of Cheerios and washing up liquid cost in the previous two shops she went to, and what they cost last week. Before her company collapsed, she would buy any groceries she liked the look of without considering the cost. But being out of work as costs soar means the 44-year-old has become incredibly focused when comparing prices. Now, doing a big shop at this retail park in south-east London takes about four hours. ""I go to the extreme in everything,"" she admits. ""For 5p [price difference], if it's walking distance I will go, or if it's a Â£1 saving, I'll get in the car."" She would have driven for smaller savings than this before, but thinks twice now petrol costs have risen. Safina has already driven to this Aldi from B&M, where she picked up a 515g family pack of Cheerios for Â£2, but left behind the washing powder and cat food as she was confident she could get it cheaper elsewhere. Like Safina, more than three quarters of people in the UK are worried about the rising cost of living,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Inflation hit a 40-year high in April, with spiralling grocery prices a particular issue. Budget and staple itemshave gone up by more than 15% year on year- including a 50% increase for the cheapest type of pasta. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Safina ran her own events business promoting African music artists in the UK. She had a glamorous existence mixing with celebrities and club promotors, but life is now very different. ""Times got harder and harder, prices kept rising, and then the next thing, Covid came and the entertainment industry died. There was no way I could create events because there were no clubs and pubs,"" she explains. ""Yes, the government was offering small businesses money but you had to eventually pay that back. It's too risky - you're going to find yourself in a big debt."" Safina currently receives universal credit. In the long run, she hopes to get back into events organising, but says rising costs mean it's just too perilous at the moment. ""Covid has come down and everything has opened up [again]  but there's another problem - everything has gone up price-wise. So going back to starting your own business is close to impossible,"" she explains. But there are still a lot of mouths to feed at home. Safina lives with her 18-year-old daughter, a student and waitress who helps her pay the bills. There's also her six year old son, 16-year-old stepdaughter and Safina's sister, who worked in luxury travel before losing her job in the pandemic. Naturally good at maths, Safina has poured all the analytical skills from running her own business into her money-saving endeavours. Before she hits the shops she checks out prices online, so knows roughly where to find the best value. She will head to Asda for fresh food, Iceland's Food Warehouse for frozen items, Lidl or Aldi for tins and vegetables, rice and pasta, and then to Primark if she needs to buy clothes. Why are prices rising so quickly? When will we get the Â£400 energy grant? This trip to Aldi and B&M was a ""top-up"" shop, she said. On a previous occasion, we accompanied Safina on her main food shop, where she scrutinised the costs at her local Asda superstore. ""Five pounds for mincemeat? That's ridiculous. No, I'll have to find somewhere else. This mozzarella is Â£2. In Home Bargains, it's Â£1. That's a huge, huge difference."" She's happier with the eggs, where she's convinced she's picked up a bargain. ""Where can you find 15 eggs for Â£2 right now? And they're free range,"" she says. Then there's another find. ""The vegetable oil is five litres for Â£7 - I think is the best deal so far. So this is coming home - yay! I won't have to buy oil for maybe two months."" The entire shop comes to Â£49, which she says will last her household of five almost a week. But this is just the beginning - she's off to Home Bargains next to pick up the toiletries she felt were too costly here. Even though Safina is saving hundreds on her old weekly shop, she says she would go back to her former life in a heartbeat. ""It keeps me awake at night. You are constantly worrying, your stress levels are high. You just want to go out to one shop, get what you need and just go home. The hassle of it gets exhausting."" Campaigner and former food bank userJack Monroe has spoken about responses to a Tweetshe published showing the ""huge amount of work"" that goes into food shopping on a Â£20 budget. ""This is what countless people up and down the country are doing... and it's exhausting,"" she told the BBC. ""People who are in poverty are extraordinarily organised and budget for within an inch of their lives."" The government has been under pressure to do more to help people weather the recent price increases, and recently announced a Â£15bn support package. Every household will receive an energy bill discount of Â£400, while eight million on means-tested benefits will also be given Â£650, paid in two lump sums. ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices which is why we have acted to protect the eight million most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year with additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits,"" a government spokesman said.

"Prices for petrol and diesel has exceed Â£2 in parts of the Highlands, but operators said there were various factors behind the costs People living in the Highlands have long been used to higher fuel prices, even before the recent rapid rise in costs. The RAC estimates that the average price for a litre of petrol in the UK has increased to 182.31p and 188.05p for diesel, the fuel of choice for many in the region. But in many parts of the Highlands, petrol now costs just a few pennies short of Â£2. And at one filling station at Cluanie in Glen Shiel, it costs 208.7p for petrol and 221.7p for diesel. Operators said various factors - including higher supplier costs - had pushed up the costs. The AA says prices have historically been high in the Highlands because smaller stations sell very low volumes of fuel, so recouping their costs is much harder. Many of these sites survived because local people know if they did not use them, they would be forced to close. Highland councillor Margaret Paterson has concerns for families and older people Margaret Paterson worries the impact of the soaring prices goes beyond a financial burden. ""Some parts of the Highlands have always suffered from high prices due to their rurality,"" said the Highland councillor, and grandmother of 17. ""But this is a new hardship, and it is being felt worst in the rural areas because of the distance from shops and other services, and the lack of public transport. ""For some people, their car is a lifesaver."" The Dingwall-based councillor fears older people, particularly those who live alone, will be among those hardest hit. Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Cost of filling average car with petrol hits Â£100 Petrol prices see biggest daily jump in 17 years Why is petrol so expensive? She said: ""I was speaking to a gentleman in the shops yesterday and he said he looks forward to coming into town because for him it is a day out. He can see and chat to people while getting his messages. ""But he was worried he will have to give up his car because he won't be able to afford to run it. ""People are not going to just struggle financially, this is going to have an effect on their wellbeing. ""For the older generation separated from families during the Covid pandemic, they now face not being able to see children and grandchildren because they cannot afford to travel."" The owners of pumps at the Cluanie Inn have a poster advising customers where they can get lower-priced fuel Black Sheep Hotels, owners of the Cluanie Inn and its fuel pumps, said there were a number of reasons behind the cost of its petrol and diesel. It said it had to buy its fuel from independent suppliers at much higher rates than branded filling stations and, because there was no main power supply at the site, had to run a generator for electricity 24 hours a day. There were also costs around the software and hardware for the automated pumps. Black Sheep said it had a poster at the pumps advising customers how far away lower-priced fuel was available. It added that it had a plan to close the pumps because they were loss-making, but had kept them open following appeals from customers. Pete Malone runs a small petrol station as part of Bettyhill General Merchants in Bettyhill on the north Highland coast. His prices are 184.5p for petrol and 196p for diesel. It is one of three or four filling stations on a stretch between Thurso and Durness - a two-hour, 71 miles (114km) journey by road. Pete told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme that they had been used to having relatively high prices for many years. Bettyhill General Merchants has a small petrol station ""We are a small petrol station and we have taken the view that we need to support our local community so we are running on as low a margin as can possibly get by on,"" he said. ""We are hampered slightly by the fact there aren't many people who will deliver fuel as far north as we are, but we can set the price we want."" And he added: ""If you look at the people who rely on petrol and diesel in the area, it's the school bus, it's the NHS care workers, it's the doctor, it's the fire engine and the ambulance. The are all going to have to pay higher costs."" Fuel forms an important part of Laura Moon's work as a tour guide with her husband Ian Deveney. Based in Inverness, they have been in business for five years and take small private groups all over Scotland and northern England. They have a small fleet of cars, which all run on diesel. She said: ""We often do what we call multiday tours. This is where we pick up from the airports of Edinburgh and Glasgow then over several days we take our guests anywhere from Hadrian's Wall to the Orkney Islands - and everywhere in-between."" Laura said higher fuel prices started to bite around February. Tour guides Laura and Ian said rising costs were a huge concern ""It's a shock when you're at the pump and you are aware the tank isn't full and the digits are still going up,"" she said. The weekly fuel bill for their three vehicles is now in the region of Â£500 per car. Laura said the costs were a huge concern. ""With the two years of the pandemic many in our industry hadn't earned a penny until about March 2022,"" she said. ""Tourism is booming again but - like many - we held our 2019 prices for people that postponed rather than cancelled their bookings. ""Those were all priced at the fuel prices from 2019.  In a year when everyone needs help to get back onto their feet we are struggling with a much-reduced profit margin."" Nyomi Dixon runs the Whisky Away cafe in Inverness and branched out into mobile catering in April, selling home-bakes and teas and coffees from a customised caravan. She said higher prices were making that side of the business harder. Cafe owner Nyomi Dixon worries how rising costs will impact on her new business ""Running the generator on petrol has increased from about Â£4 for three hours to now costing around Â£14,"" Nyomi said. ""Depending on how many days we trade obviously changes how much we spend weekly. Diesel to tow the caravan with our van has hiked up in the last three months."" She added: ""I'm definitely worried the increase will continue to rise and what that may mean for our business in the future, but hopefully we have a great summer and then Whisk On Wheels can hibernate and hopefully fuel costs will be lower next year."" The haulage industry warned earlier this week that the cost of running just one lorrywas up Â£20,000 on last year. Lochaber-based self-employed haulier Sandy MacCallum fills his lorry's diesel tank two to three times a week. At the end of last year it cost about Â£480 each visit, but the haulier said it was now up to Â£930. Sandy, who hauls machinery, industrial equipment and logs, said he and others had long lived with higher Highland fuel prices. ""You just keep adjusting,"" he said. ""In November the fuel prices really started to hit. Soon I was thinking: 'This isn't slowing down, this isn't going to stop'."" Self-employed lorry driver Sandy MacCallum worries that fuel costs will continue to rise Sandy is now into his third year driving his own lorry. He had expected to be making money back by this stage, after losses in the first year and breaking even in the second. ""But the fuel costs mean I'm having to press the restart button,"" he said. Sandy said rising costs were being felt right across his industry, and filtering through the wider economy. He said: ""The wee bit of money I have left at the end of the week to spend on what I want is now going on fuel."" Sandy added that he was now hoping that hauliers would stage protests to force a reduction in prices. He believes lorry drivers should join with other workers, including those in the NHS, to take action in the coming weeks. ""Either that or we are going to drive ourselves into the ground,"" he said.

"Denise Gun said she is also suffering from grief, having lost her parents and partner within 12 months A woman has said she cannot remember the last time she had a hot meal due to the rising prices of her bills. Denise Gun, 57, works for a creche run by Chell Area Family Action Group in the Whitfield Valley Centre, Stoke-on-Trent. After taking to Facebook to ask local friends where to get help for food from, Ms Gun got financial advice from the organisation Potteries Moneywise. ""My fridge is empty, my purse has been empty for months,"" Ms Gun said. ""I never have money for what people would deem luxuries of life like going out for a drink or just having a little treat - that's just a dream now."" The Whitfield Valley Centre is a base for the charity Chell Area Family Action Group as well as recently running sessions of how to budget Lloyd Myatt a financial advisor from Potteries Moneywise runs regular sessions on budgeting.

"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

"Ice cream van owners are feeling the effects of fuel price hikes Ice cream vendors could be forced to ditch their livelihoods as fuel prices rise, industry chiefs have warned. The doughty purveyors of frosted treats are a welcome summertime sight, but their vans use diesel-guzzling engines. Many need to keep their vehicles ticking over, even when stationary, and can clock up high mileage as they travel to events or profitable patches. Industry body chairman Maurice ""Moz"" Murray, said of this summer: ""Beyond doubt, we will lose vans."" Thecost of petrol has soared in recent days, with the average litre of unleaded costing 182.31p, and diesel 188.05p. Mr Murray said the Ice Cream Mobilisers and Associated Trades Alliance (ICMAT), and its 2,500 members from Scotland to Cornwall, were ""deeply concerned"". ""It's only going to get worse over the summer when we visit various events over the summer holiday,"" he said. Mr Murray, who trades in Lancashire, said the industry was at breaking point and the latest fuel hikes threatened to put some out of business. Ice cream van seller Maurice Murray usually does a roaring trade over the summer ""My own fuel costs have gone up by a good third,"" he said. ""Ice cream is not a necessity. It's a luxury. People are having to cut back on luxuries."" Hull-based Lawrence Glauser said he had gone from spending Â£25 per day on diesel for his Mercedes Sprinter van to about Â£50. He explained that Mr Whippy machines need to be into mains power or run off the van's engine, which needs to be kept running. ""It works a bit like a car's air conditioning system,"" said Mr Glauser. ""From 11:30am to 7:30pm, my van is chugging away."" Ian Smith with his 'pride and joy' vintage van Ian Smith, whose company Mr Whippy Leeds operates a fleet of eight vans, said paying over Â£100 to fill up a van ""is [previously] unheard of"". ""Not everyone can stand the extra cost, especially if they're driving around or travelling a long way to sites,"" he said. Mr Smith said there was currently no viable alternative to diesel. ""We're stuck with it until someone develops an electric van capable of carrying the weight that we require,"" he said. ""But even then electricity is going up too."" Mr Glauser is adamant that he won't swap to selling soft scoop ice cream, which is stored in battery-powered freezers. He said: ""I'm a Mr Whippy man, not a scoop man. If I can't afford to keep the engine running, I guess I'll be just be another ice cream man that bites the dust."" Mr Glauser, who has been in the industry since 2000, said it would be a crying shame if ice cream vans were to be consigned to history. ""There's nothing like the feeling you get when you see a little kid's smile at being handed an ice cream,"" he said. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"A group of people, thought to be asylum seekers, arriving at Dover (file image) A flight to take asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda next Tuesday has been allowed to go ahead by the High Court. Campaigners failed in an initial legal bid to halt the removals to the east African country, but have confirmed they will take the case to the Court of Appeal on Monday. Under the policy, some of those entering the UK illegally will be flown to Rwanda to apply for asylum there. About 31 people have been told they may be on the first flight. There will be a full judicial review, where the High Court will hear a challenge to the policy as a whole, before the end of July, it heard. In his decision, the judge Mr Justice Swift accepted there was a ""material public interest"" in Home Secretary Priti Patel being able to carry out her policies. Ms Patel praised his judgement and said the government would go ahead with its plans, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the ruling as ""welcome news"". However, campaigners who brought the case expressed concern for the welfare of people set to be ""forcibly deported"". One asylum seeker  - an Iranian ex-police commander - who was told he will be deported on Tuesday has saidhe fears being killed by Iranian agentsin Rwanda. He has been held at a detention centre since arriving in the UK from Turkey in May. UK Rwanda plan against law, says UN refugee agency The Rwanda hotels waiting to cash in on UK asylum deal Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion It comes as theDaily Mail,externaland theTimes reports the Prince of Wales has been privately critical,externalof the government's policy - quoting a source saying he thinks the approach is ""appalling"". Prince Charles is to represent the Queen in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, at a Commonwealth summit later this month. His office reiterated he remains ""politically neutral"". The government hopes the scheme will discourage asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel, by making it clear many cases will now be dealt with by Rwanda. More than 10,000 people have made the dangerous sea journey so far this year. While their application is considered by Rwanda those affected will be given accommodation and support and, if successful, will be able to remain there with up to five years' access to education and support. Those who fail in their asylum bids in Rwanda will be offered the chance to apply for visas under other immigration routes if they wish to remain in the country, but could still face deportation. Campaigners had sought to block the flight from leaving, as well as individual people being placed on it. An excerpt of the document given to some asylum seekers by the Home Office The case was brought by lawyers representing asylum seekers set to be deported, alongside the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) - which represents more than 80% of UK Border Force staff - and migration charities Care4Calais and Detention Action. Their lawyers raised concerns about shortcomings in the Rwanda asylum system and the possibility that people could be sent on to countries where they would be persecuted - a process known as refoulement. Home Office lawyers had told the court the plan must not be stopped by legal challenges because it was in the public interest, and also urged the judge to reject challenges on behalf of individual asylum seekers. At the hearing, the UN's refugee body, the UNHCR, also intervened to distance itself from the policy amid claims the Home Office has misrepresented its position on the scheme. Lawyers for the UNHCR also said it had warned the Home Office twice that its arrangement with Rwanda was unlawful. In his judgement, Mr Justice Swift ruled against a temporary block on the deportation flights before the full hearing on the policy in July. He said he did not consider there was any evidence there would be ""ill-treatment, refoulement"" or anything that violated their rights under article three of the UK's Human Rights Act. Article three protects people from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and deportation or extradition to a country where there is a real risk they will face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Mr Justice Swift said part of the case to block the initial flights focused on the argument that Ms Patel's ""decision to treat Rwanda as a safe country is either irrational or based on insufficient investigation"". He said this argument, along with other parts of the case, would be heard with evidence at the full judicial review, to be held across two days before the end of July. A judicial review sees a judge looking at how a decision, or action, has been made by a public body. It does not consider whether the decision itself is correct or not. But Mr Justice Swift noted that, while the campaigners had enough evidence for a review, their claim was ""not conspicuously strong"". He also denied interim relief to two people who face removal on Tuesday, one from Syria and another from Iraq, who are still set to be on the plane to Rwanda. ""I accept that the fact of removal to Rwanda will be onerous,"" he added. However, the judge granted the campaigners and migrants the right to appeal against his decision and said the Court of Appeal would be able to hear their case on Monday. Following the judgement, Ms Patel said the government would ""continue to deliver on progressing"" the plan. She said: ""People will continue to try and prevent their relocation through legal challenges and last-minute claims, but we will not be deterred in breaking the deadly people smuggling trade and ultimately saving lives. ""Rwanda is a safe country and has previously been recognised for providing a safe haven for refugees - we will continue preparations for the first flight to Rwanda, alongside the range of other measures intended to reduce small boat crossings."" Mr Johnson tweeted: ""We cannot allow people traffickers to put lives at risk and our world leading partnership will help break the business model of these ruthless criminals."" James Wilson, deputy director of campaign group Detention Action, said it was disappointed, but added there were ""some positives"" from the case - noting that six of the eight original claimants had their removal orders withdrawn by the Home Office in advance of the judgement. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said the charity was ""deeply concerned for the welfare of people who may be forcibly deported to Rwanda, a fate that could profoundly harm their mental health and future"". The PCS union has called for urgent talks with Ms Patel to discuss the removal policy following the ruling.

"An ""unprecedented shortage"" of a substitute for illegal heroin in England is putting hundreds of lives at risk, say drug workers. Diamorphine is a pharmaceutical form of the drug prescribed when methadone and other medications are ineffective. Former heroin users have told the BBC they have relapsed for the first time in decades as a result of the shortage. Doctors say the problem is also affecting some end-of-life patients who are given diamorphine for pain relief. The Department of Health says alternative medications ""remain available"", while pharmaceutical companies say they are working hard to address supply issues. First heroin treatment clinic for addicts to open Heroin addict clinic extension 'a no brainer' Waterloo Road star reveals 20-year heroin battle Diamorphine hydrochloride is a pure chemical form of heroin prescribed to around 200 former drug users in England who have not responded well to other forms of treatment. Patients take it at home and are regularly tested to prove they are not buying extra doses of illegal heroin on the black market, which is often contaminated - or cut - with other chemicals and impurities. Sarah, not her real name, has been injecting several doses of diamorphine a day since first getting help for drug addiction in the 1990s. ""It completely removes any desire to use heroin and stops me from using any illicit drugs whatsoever,"" she says. ""Diamorphine doesn't sedate me at all so I'm able to function normally and I'm able to work."" Sarah, who is now in her 60s and married with grandchildren, has a job as a senior care worker in south-west England. She told the BBC that a ""total absence"" of diamorphine from pharmacies in her area means she has relapsed and started using street heroin for the first time in more than a decade. ""After all that hard work and effort, the stability that I've had for years and years has just gone,"" she says. ""You are angry for letting yourself do it, especially when you've tried so hard to be away from it all, but you can't stop yourself because any replacement medication is just not as effective."" Pharmacies have repeatedly warned about ""significant shortages"" of some key drugs this year, as the pandemic has stretched global supply chains and the price of the precursor chemicals used to make medicines has increased. Diamorphine is supplied in England by two large generic drug manufacturers: Accord Healthcare and Wockhardt, which are both based in India with British subsidiaries. The companies confirmed they are out of stock of certain quantities of the treatment, which comes in different-sized ampules or phials. Accord said the manufacturing process is complex and the problem is not with a shortage of raw materials, but in processing the medication into its final freeze-dried form. There have been intermittent supply problems with diamorphine for the last four years but drug workers say the current situation in England is ""completely unprecedented"" with patients left without their regular medication since March. ""This is the worst shortage that I've ever been aware of,"" says Claire Robbins, nurse advocate and drugs adviser at the charity Release. ""These are patients who have not used street heroin for decades in some cases and there is a real risk that someone is going to die in this current drought."" Accord Healthcare said it is working closely with the government and the medicines regulator, the MHRA, to test and release the next batch of diamorphine as quickly as possible. Wockhardt said it is addressing supply issues and anticipates that by July ""sufficient access to the drug will be restored"". Drug charities warn that swift action is needed at a time when a far stronger, more dangerous form of street heroin cut with the chemical isotonitazene has been detected in parts of the UK. ""We urgently need to secure a stable supply of diamorphine for these patients,"" says Ms Robbins. ""The UK is currently experiencing the highest rate of drug-related deaths on record. This is a crisis."" Northern Ireland has also been affected by the shortage. In Wales, drug workers say diamorphine is not prescribed in the same way, while in Scotland a different product is shipped from Switzerland, which hasn't suffered from the same supply problems. Diamorphine is also used as a strong painkiller in hospitals after some types of surgery, or in hospices for end-of-life care. Doctors say they have struggled to access the medicine, with the situation getting worse over the pandemic. There are alternative treatments, such as morphine, but they have to be given in much larger quantities to have a similar effect, which is not always medically possible. ""You just can't leave people in extreme pain. It is immoral to do that with a terminal illness,"" says Dr Amy Proffitt, a hospital consultant and president of the Association of Palliative Medicine. ""Back in May 2020 we were told this was going to get better by the summer. Two years on and we really need someone to get a grip and address this situation."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was aware of an ""ongoing issue with diamorphine injections"". ""We want to reassure patients that alternative opioid products, including all forms of morphine, remain available and if they have any concerns, they should speak to their prescriber or pharmacist,"" she said. ""We are working with suppliers to manage the issue, and with NHS England and national experts on advice for healthcare professionals regarding alternative treatments for affected patients.""

"The fire has badly damaged the pub, with most of the roof destroyed A pub part-owned by England and Nottinghamshire cricketer Stuart Broad has been badly damaged by a fire. Firefighters were called to the Tap and Run in the village of Upper Broughton, on the border of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, at about 03:20 BST. The roof and first floor of the pub - which is also owned by former cricketer Harry Gurney - have been destroyed. The owners said they were ""devastated"" and the fire service said the cause was believed to have been accidental. The cricketers thanked the public for their support and promised the pub would open again No-one was injured and the fire service said the road outside had reopened just after 13:00. In a statement, Broad and Gurney said: ""We are devastated to announce that due to a significant fire in the early hours of June 11th The Tap & Run will not be trading for the foreseeable future. ""We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the outpouring of support. ""And finally... we will be back! Watch this space."" Allow Twitter content?

Residents were asked to avoid the area and keep windows closed Eight fire crews from Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire were at the scene at the height of the blaze. The fire service said an aerial ladder platform, water carrier and command support vehicle were also deployed. People living nearby were advised to keep their doors and windows closed.

The protocol legislation is expected to be published on Monday. Sir Keir made the comments in an interview with the BBC after meeting the SDLP and Alliance on Friday.

A row over its impact has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland, with the DUP blocking the establishment of the assembly since Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party in last month's election Sir Keir said the planned government legislation would breach international law and that he would scrap it if he became prime minister. ""I also think it will be an impediment to the negotiations,"" he said. Sir Keir Starmer and Shadow Secretary of State Peter Kyle talk to assembly speaker Alex Maskey at Stormont Sir Keir said he believed there was scope for a veterinary agreement that would potentially resolve a ""high percentage"" of the issues in the protocol. He added: ""When I think of all the issues, all the challenges that have been overcome in the last 20 years I don't think that the remaining issues of the protocol are incapable of resolution."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was refreshing to have a ""grown-up in leadership in London engaging properly with political parties here and with the Irish government."" ""It's what's been missing, frankly, from this British government over the past number of years. What we've seen from Boris Johnson has been unilateral action on legacy,"" he added. ""Now, on Monday, we're going to see unilateral action on the protocol, having had no conversations with parties here, no conversations with the Irish government, and just taking a wrecking ball to the progress that we've had."" Alliance leader Naomi Long said reform of the Stormont institutions was necessary to prevent single parties such as the DUP from being able to block the formation of a devolved executive. ""The issues with the protocol really do not justify the egregious breach of international law and international trust that the government are now embarking on via legislation basically at the behest of the DUP,"" she said. ""If the government wants to take some legislation forward so that these institutions here can be restored and that they can do that on a stable footing, they should be looking to reform these institutions in legislation to ensure that no party can hold the institutions to ransom going forward."" Sir Keir has also committed to voting against acontroversial legacy bill proposed by the governmentwhich has seen widespread opposition from local parties and victims' groups. Sir Keir Starmer arriving at Stormont on Friday morning A central element of the proposals involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations run by a new information recovery body. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. However, it led to new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the DUP, argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP, which has the second highest number of Stormont seats,has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first ministeruntil there is ""action"" on the protocol. The BBC understands there is still some work being done on the legal text of the new protocol bill, which has yet to be signed off by ministers. Liz Truss is said to be keen for the legislation to get through the Commons before the summer recess. Meanwhile Conall Donnelly, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association (NIMEA) urged the UK government to ""not ignore the benefits of the protocol"". Mr Donnelly said its members were heavily dependent on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with Northern Ireland businesses annually importing about Â£200m in beef across the Irish Sea for further processing. He said the current trading arrangements were providing an effective and workable platform for trade and members of the association benefitted from unfettered trade with Great Britain and Europe. He argued the UK and EU should commit to agreed solutions rather than taking unilateral action which could potentially jeopardise jobs and business opportunities in Northern Ireland. ""We recognise that some aspects of the protocol need to be fixed, such as the facilitation of retail movements or certain food and farming issues but there are solutions to these issues, which can be jointly agreed through compromise, and it is essential that business is involved in that process to ensure that solutions are practical,"" he said.
