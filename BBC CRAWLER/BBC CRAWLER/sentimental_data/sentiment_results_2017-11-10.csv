"Lilleth went missing some time in the last three weeks A wild cat which escaped from a Ceredigion zoo has been ""humanely destroyed"", the county council has confirmed. Lilleth, the Eurasian lynx,escaped from Borth Wild Animal Kingdomat some point in the last three weeks. The council said despite ""exhaustive efforts"" to recapture her, it received advice that the risk to public safety had ""increased to severe"". Earlier on Friday, the council said the zoo would be put under scrutiny. Lynx 'leapt' over electrified zoo fence Escaped lynx 'playing with us' Escaped lynx 'evades capture' overnight This video can not be played Lynx at Borth Wild Animal Kingdom similar to the one that has gone missing A statement released by the local authority on Friday evening said the lynx had strayed over to a populated area of the community and ""it was necessary to act decisively"". ""The safety of the the public was paramount,"" the statement added. Staff at the zoo, which has been closed since Lilleth's escape, had been attempting to catch her. She is believed to have escapedafter making a ""giant leap"" over an electrified fence. Lilleth caught on camera near one of the baited traps There had been a number of sightings but she evaded capture and was at one point thought to be hiding in bushes near the zoo. Ceredigion council and Dyfed-Powys Police said they had tried a ""range of measures"" to capture the Lynx, including baited traps. A post-mortem examination of a sheep found dead on land near the zoo showed ""traumatic injury"" but experts have been unable to say if the missing lynx was responsible. The council said it would carry out an inspection of the zoo later this month.

"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested the suspects Three Canadians who were involved in a bizarre car crash while naked have been charged with kidnapping and resisting arrest. They were among five nude people detained after a two-vehicle collision on a rural highway last Monday about 30km (20 miles) south of Edmonton. The man and two women appeared in court in Leduc, Alberta, on Thursday. They allegedly kidnapped a man, a woman and a six-week-old baby from a home and forced them into a vehicle. The abducted man, who was being held in the car boot, somehow managed to escape, police say. Shortly after so did the woman with the baby. Bear gets a punch after entering home No naked dancing, Canada revellers told A man who was driving to work along the highway picked up the three victims after he saw them shoeless on the road. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) says the BMW driven by the alleged kidnappers then apparently deliberately rammed the Good Samaritan's vehicle, before ending up in the ditch at the side of the road. Those allegedly kidnapped were not injured. The three accused cannot be named due to a court publication ban. Two female minors who were also arrested at the scene were later released with no charges. Derek Scott, the employer of the man who picked up the three victims after their escape, witnessed the arrest. He told the Canadian Press,externalit was a ""wild fight"" to get the female suspect out of the car. He also described the ""walk of shame"" taken by the nude kidnappers. There has been no explanation as to why five people were not wearing any clothes on a Monday morning in subzero temperatures. Police say they believe it was a ""targeted incident"" and that the kidnappers knew the three people they took from the home. The RCMP has called the ongoing investigation ""convoluted"", adding that drugs or alcohol may have been a factor. A relative who spoke toCTV News,externalandthe Canadian Press,externalsaid the whole incident was completely out of character for those involved. He believes they unknowingly ingested a ""herbal tea"" brought back from an overseas trip that may have had hallucinogenic properties. ""It's a scary thought thinking, 'Oh, let's try this tea that we purchased,'"" the relative told the Canadian Press. ""And then all sit down thinking they're just going to have a nice morning and end up in that circumstance.""

"The three victims have been taken to hospital A driver has ploughed into a group of pedestrians near the French city of Toulouse, injuring three Chinese exchange students. A 23-year-old woman was seriously injured, and two men aged 22 and 23 were also hurt, police said. The incident occurred outside a college in the suburb of Blagnac. The 28-year-old driver ""purposefully hit"" the group on a crosswalk, Toulouse prosecutor Pierre-Yves Couilleau said. The victims are students at the ICD-Toulouse International Business School. The woman's life is not in danger, police said. The driver was arrested immediately afterwards. Police said he had several previous minor convictions, some drugs-related. Unconfirmed reports say he had a history of mental illness including acute schizophrenia. La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi newspaper quoted him as telling police he had heard voices telling him to harm someone. Mr Couilleau visited the scene of the accident and said there was no suggestion the incident was an act of terrorism. ""What matters in this case is the psychiatric profile of the person,"" he said. The man ""had been planning this act for a month"", Mr Couilleau added. Toulouse Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenctweeted (in French),external: ""Very shocked by the aggression towards the students in Blagnac.

"Louis CK has won six Emmy Awards and had 39 nominations US comedian Louis CK has admitted that sexual misconduct allegations made against him by five women are true. He said he had ""wielded power irresponsibly"" and could hardly wrap his head around the ""scope of hurt"" he had caused them. Four of the accusers told the New York Times he masturbated during interactions with them and a fifth said he had asked to do so. The allegations led to the release of his new movie being scrapped. I Love You Daddy - a comedy about an ageing film director, played by John Malkovich, who has a reputation for getting embroiled with young women - was due to have been released in the US on 17 November. ""These stories are true,"" Louis CK said in his statement, which is reproduced in full at the bottom of this article. ""The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly."" The comedian added that he regretted the hurt he had inflicted on people he worked with, including his manager Dave Becky, his family, his friends, his children and their mother. In Thursday's New York Times report,external, four comediennes - Dana Min Goodman, Julia Wolov, Rebecca Corry and Abby Schachner - and a fifth woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, made allegations about the entertainer. Actresses Julia Wolov (left) and Dana Goodman in Hollywood in 2011 Goodman and Wolov said Louis CK stripped naked and masturbated after inviting them to his hotel room during the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002. Schachner said she called Louis CK in 2003 to invite him to one of her shows and was dumbfounded to realise during their phone conversation that he was masturbating. ""I felt very ashamed,"" she told the New York Times. A fifth woman, who did not want to be named, told the newspaper of alleged incidents involving the comic in the late 1990s, while she was working in production on The Chris Rock Show. Louis CK, who was a writer and producer on the show, repeatedly asked her to watch him perform a sex act, she said. ""He abused his power,"" she said. Abby Schachner told the New York Times she felt ""very ashamed"" Louis CK's planned appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled and HBO announced it would purge Louis CK's past projects from its On Demand service. The cable TV network also said the comic would no longer participate in a charity comedy special, Night of Too Many Stars, later this month. On Thursday, a Los Angeles County district attorney Jackie Lacey announced a task force of veteran sex crimes prosecutors to address ""the widespread allegations of sexual abuse in entertainment industry"". ""I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not. ""These stories are true.  At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question. It's a predicament for them.   The power I had over these women is that they admired me.  And I wielded that power irresponsibly. ""I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. ""I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it. I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. ""There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for.  And I have to reconcile it with who I am.  Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. ""I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work. ""The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else.  And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I'd be remiss to exclude the hurt that I've brought on people who I work with and have worked with who's professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I've brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years. ""I've brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother. ""I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want.

"Mr Nasrallah said it was now ""beyond any doubt"" that Mr Hariri had been forced out by the Saudis The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah has accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war on his country, days after Lebanese PM Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation in the Saudi capital. Hassan Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was holding Mr Hariri against his will. He also accused the Saudis of inciting Israel against Lebanon. The powerful Hezbollah Shia movement is an ally of Iran, which has been trading accusations with the Saudis of fuelling tension in Lebanon and the region. Mr Hariri said in a TV broadcast from Riyadh on Saturday he was stepping downbecause of an unspecified threat to his life. He also attacked Hezbollah and Iran. However, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and other senior politicians have demanded his return, amid suspicions that he is being held by the Saudis under house arrest and forced to do their bidding. Mr Aoun has not accepted Mr Hariri's resignation. Mr Hariri has still not spoken publicly since his announcement. Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles In a televised speech on Friday, Mr Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was trying to provoke fighting amongst the Lebanese. ""In short, it is clear that Saudi Arabia and Saudi officials have declared war on Lebanon and on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but I have to say this is a war on Lebanon,"" he said. Mr Nasrallah also accused Saudi Arabia of being prepared to pay ""billions"" to Israel for a military strike against Lebanon, describing this as the ""most dangerous thing"". Mr Hariri (R) was seen meeting the Saudi king on Monday At the weekend the Hezbollah leader had said that Mr Hariri had been forced to resign by the Saudis, but he repeated the allegations on Friday, saying that this was now ""beyond any doubt"". Saudi Arabia was attempting to remove Mr Hariri as prime minister and impose a new leadership on his political movement, he said. BBC Middle East editor Sebastian Usher says Mr Nasrallah's words were delivered as calmly as ever - but they will inevitably raise the temperature further as a growing number of countries outside the region try to calm the crisis. There are fears Lebanon could become embroiled in a wider regional confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Tensions between the three countries have soared since Mr Hariri announced his resignation. But US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned against Lebanon being used for a proxy conflict, adding that the US strongly backed Lebanon's independence. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that a new conflict in the region would have ""devastating consequences"". On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, to emphasise to Saudi leaders the importance of stability in Lebanon. France has historical ties with Lebanon, as its former colonial power before it gained independence during World War Two. Earlier on Thursday, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies told their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. The move came afterRiyadh accused Iran of ""direct military aggression"", saying it supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Iran has dismissed the Saudi allegations as ""false and dangerous"". By Barbara Plett, BBC State Department Correspondent US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Saudi foreign minister assured him that Riyadh did not force Saad al-Hariri to resign, and that he had no indication Mr Hariri was being held against his will. But he encouraged the prime minister to return to Lebanon and clarify the situation so the government could function, expressing concern about how the crisis might affect the stability of the fragile coalition. His warning against using Lebanon as a proxy battlefield appeared to be aimed primarily at Iran but also Saudi Arabia. On Riyadh's corruption purge the Secretary of State said he was inclined to believe the crackdown was well intended, but it was still unclear how disruptive it would be. It took him six days to respond to the extraordinarily volatile situation in the Middle East, renewing criticism that the US lacks a strategy for the crucial region. It is also a sign that the State Department is not driving foreign policy: President Trump tweets out positions, in this case a very pro-Saudi stance, and Mr Tillerson follows later with a more nuanced approach.

"One unofficial cartoon shows Peppa Pig having teeth pulled at the dentist YouTube is to restrict the availability of videos showing children's characters in violent or sexual scenes if they are reported by viewers. Last week, a blog post by writer James Bridle highlighted how YouTube was still being swamped by bizarre and indecent videos aimed at children. The site says it already stops such videos earning advertising revenue. YouTube said its team was ""made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right"". But critics say YouTube is not taking enough action by waiting for viewers to report inappropriate videos. The problem of video-makers using popular characters such as Peppa Pig in violent or sexual videos, to frighten children, has beenwidely reported. However,Mr Bridle's blog post,externalwent deeper into what he called the rabbit hole of children's content on YouTube. He gave examples of videos aimed at children that were not necessarily violent or sexual but were sinister, ""disturbing"" or otherwise inappropriate. Often it appeared that the videos had been algorithmically generated to capitalise on popular trends. In one clip, Spiderman and Elsa, from Frozen, fire machine guns ""Stock animations, audio tracks, and lists of keywords being assembled in their thousands to produce an endless stream of videos,"" he said. Many used popular family entertainment characters such as Spiderman, and Elsa from Frozen, and had been viewed millions of times. ""Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale,"" he wrote. YouTube says it has already barred such videos from earning advertising money when they are reported by viewers, to try to remove the incentive to produce them. However, many of the videos do not get reported by viewers and continue to carry advertisements. YouTube has now said it will give such videos an age restriction if they are reported by viewers, so they cannot be viewed by people under 18. Some of the videos are not rude or violent but use Disney characters in odd situations Age-restricted videos are blocked from appearing in the YouTube Kids app, which is primarily curated by algorithms. They also cannot be viewed on the YouTube website unless people are logged in with an adult's account. However, areport in the New York Times,externalfound that inappropriate videos have previously slipped through the net. YouTube says it uses human reviewers to evaluate whether flagged videos are appropriate for a family audience. In his blog post, Mr Bridle said he did not know how YouTube could stamp out the problem. ""We have built a world which operates at scale, where human oversight is simply impossible, and no manner of inhuman oversight will counter most of the examples I've used in this essay,"" he said.

"Laura Plummer and her partner Omar Caboo A British woman being held in Egypt on drug smuggling charges says she had ""no idea"" the prescription painkillers she was carrying were banned there. Laura Plummer, 33, is due in court on Saturday accused of smuggling 300 tablets of Tramadol, a painkiller that is legal in the UK but not in Egypt. The shop assistant from Hull says they were given to her for her Egyptian boyfriend's ""back problems"". Local police says that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ms Plummer's relatives hope the judge at her custody hearing in the Red Sea Resort of Hurghada on Saturday will believe she made an innocent mistake - drug smuggling can be punishable by death in Egypt. Tramadol is legal in the UK with a prescription but banned in Egypt where many are addicted to the opiate. Ms Plummer told the BBC that a colleague had given her the tablets in a chemist's bag that she put in her suitcase. ""I didn't even look in bag,"" she said. ""I can't tell you how stupid I feel."" She said her cell in a police station was the size of her bedroom in the UK, but she was having to share it with 25 other women. She said her spirits were at rock bottom and she dreamt of coming home, catching up with her favourite soap opera Emmerdale, sleeping in her own bed, and having a cup of tea.

"Isaiah, pictured with an aunt, has brain damage A mother and father are fighting a High Court battle to stop their eight-month-old son's life support machine being switched off. Isaiah Haastrup is brain damaged and dependent on a ventilator to keep him alive at King's College Hospital, London. Doctors said giving him further treatment was ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"". But father Lanre Haastrup and mother Takesha Thomas want it to continue. They also hope an independent assessor will be appointed to give a medical opinion. Isaiah was born with a severe brain injury believed to have been caused by oxygen deprivation. Doctors do not think there are any ""further investigations or forms of treatment"" which would benefit him, the hospital's barrister Fiona Paterson said. She told Mr Justice MacDonald relations between hospital bosses and Isaiah's parents were ""difficult"". The court heard that Mr Haastrup, of Peckham, south London, had been barred from visiting the hospital following an incident a few days ago. Mr Haastrup sought a judicial review over the ban which has been refused by the High Court. ""I am not a saint but I am not a demon either,"" he said. He told the court there had been a ""lack of care"" for Isaiah. Mr Justice MacDonald created an order barring the media from identifying medical staff caring for Isaiah and said he hoped mediation could avoid a full trial. Failing that, the court case will formally begin on 15 January. A King's College Hospital spokeswoman said Mr Haastrup had already made a written application for permission to launch a judicial review but this was refused by a judge earlier this week. In July, the High Court ruled Great Ormond Street Hospital doctors could stop providing life-support treatment to baby Charlie Gard, following a lengthy and high profile court case.

"Rapper Giggs says his gigs have been cancelled because of the form A police form some grime artists say is being used as a ""racist"" way to target them is to be scrapped in London. Since 2005, promoters and licensees have been asked to complete a ""Form 696"" as a risk assessment for hosting music events with DJs and MCs. Some grime artists say they have been stopped from performing as a result. The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in ""serious incidents"" at music events. Safety standards have been raised in venues, police say, which led to the decision. Superintendent Roy Smith of the Met, said: ""It is clear that in recent years the landscape of the night time economy in London has changed and thankfully we have seen a reduction in serious incidents at promoted music events, particularly those involving firearms."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan had called for a review of the form's use earlier this year. The force said it would instead use a new ""voluntary partnership approach"" across the city.

"Carl Sargeant died on Tuesday after an investigation was launched into his conduct An inquiry will be held into how Wales' first minister handled Carl Sargeant's sacking, days before he was found dead. Carwyn Jones ordered the inquiry into his actions amid mounting pressure, and shortly after Mr Sargeant's family said a probe should start ""immediately"". The former communities secretary was being investigated by the Labour party over claims of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". He is understood to have taken his own life on Tuesday. The Welsh Government said the inquiry would be independent but this was disputed by Mr Sargeant's family, who criticised the announcement. Mr Jones had facedcriticism for suggesting on Thursdaythat an inquiry should only be held if it was not possible for the AM's family to get answers through an inquest. His decision to hold an inquiry followed pressure from two north east Wales Labour MPs, Mark Tami and Ian Lucas,former local government minister Leighton Andrewsand opposition parties. 'No alternative' but to sack Sargeant 'Carl Sargeant not given natural justice' - family Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Minister removed over conduct claims A spokesman for the first minister said Mr Jones believes a senior QC should lead the probe to examine his ""actions and decisions"". Permanent secretary Shan Morgan, the Welsh Government's most senior civil servant, is to contact the family to discuss who the senior QC will be and the inquiry's terms of reference. However, a statement from Mr Sargeant's family said the permanent secretary reports directly to the first minister and ""is therefore not independent"", adding they would prefer a senior civil servant from Whitehall. ""We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry,"" the family said. The Welsh Government would not respond to the family's statement but a spokeswoman said: ""The impartiality of the civil service is a given."" Carwyn Jones is certainly a man being led by events. The fact that he failed yesterday to address any of the serious questions that have been raised over the past few days has only increased the pressure on him. He clearly felt it was inappropriate to do so so close to the death with so many people still grieving for Mr Sargeant. But the fact that Mr Sargeant's family and friends want answers, and more and more of them have been saying so publicly today, meant Mr Jones did not really have much choice but to announce the inquiry. The first minister will certainly be hoping this will take at least some of the pressure away after a phenomenally intense week for him and his government. This video can not be played Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge wants the first minister to stand aside after announcing the inquiry Mr Jones had been criticised for how allegations against Mr Sargeant, who was AM for Alyn and Deeside and had been suspended from the Labour party, were handled. He was dismissed from his job as communities secretary on Friday 3 November and suspended by the Labour Party but said he had not been made aware of the full details of the allegations. Bernie Attridge, deputy leader of Flintshire council and a lifelong friend of Mr Sargeant, called the announcement a ""major U-turn by Carwyn Jones, of which I welcome"". ""But I still feel, that now an independent inquiry has been set up, that he should step aside,"" he added. Mr Andrews welcomed the announcement, saying: ""I am glad an independent inquiry is to address the multiple questions that remain."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Lucas also welcomed the inquiry, as did Cardiff Central AM Jenny Rathbone. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was ""grateful"" for the announcement but said it was ""regrettable"" that it was not made in Thursday's statement. ""We need the answers to the questions that have rightly been asked of how a 49-year-old man felt so, so down at the beginning of this week that the only way out [was] that he could take his own life"", Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales. Mr Davies has also asked for an investigation into allegations made by Mr Andrews of a bullying culture in Welsh Government. The first ministerpreviously said he would be open to scrutinyover how he sacked Mr Sargeant from his Welsh Government cabinet job. This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said he had ""no alternative"" but to sack Carl Sargeant Mr Sargeant had vowed to clear his name but following his death, his family claimed he did not receive ""natural justice"". The inquest into his death is due to open and adjourn on Monday. The first minister's spokesman added: ""It is our understanding that such an inquiry should not take place before the outcome of a coroner's inquest - but we will take further advice on this matter."" The announcement was released minutes after a solicitor for the family said they were ""deeply"" concerned the first minister suggested that the answers the family seek should be dealt with in a coroner's inquest. ""What a coroner's inquest cannot determine or appear to be determining is the civil or criminal liability,"" the statement read. It added that an inquiry would determine the ""reasons for the complete abdication of responsibility and duty of care that was owed to Carl"".

"This video can not be played Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them Taxi-hailing app firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. Last yeara tribunal ruleddrivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. Uber appealed, arguing its drivers were self employed and were under no obligation to use its booking app. The firm said it would appeal against this latest ruling, too. Uber which has up to 50,000 drivers using its app in the UK, claims 80% of them would rather be classed as self employed. Uber said there were two further possible stages in the appeal process - the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. What is the 'gig' economy? The Employment Tribunal upheld its original decision that any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a ""worker"" contract. James Farrar is one of the two drivers at the centre of the case It said they were therefore entitled to workers' rights. Uber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks in a host of cities around the world. In London, where it has the bulk of its business, it is fighting to retain its licence to continue operating. James Farrar, from Hampshire, told the BBC how he was feeling: ""Just huge relief. I really hope it will stick this time and that Uber will obey the ruling of the court. ""I'd like Uber to sit down and work out how as quickly as possible that every driver who is working for Uber get the rights they are entitled to."" The law firm Leigh Day started the legal action against Uber on behalf of 25 members of the GMB union, which initially included Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, although the two pursued this latest case with a different union, the IWGB. Leigh Day is still involved in legal action against Uber and represents a total of 68 drivers in a group claim against the company. The company's Nigel Mackay said, in theory, any Uber driver in the UK could benefit from Friday's tribunal ruling, should it stand uncontested: ""The judgment directly applies to the original 25 claimants in the claim, and since then another 43 drivers have joined. ""However, given that all Uber drivers work in essentially the same way, then there is no reason why the same principles wouldn't apply across all drivers in the UK and they would all be free to join the claim and be entitled to compensation."" IWGB's general secretary, Dr Jason Moyer-Lee, said: ""Today's victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights."" The GMB union said the ruling, by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT), was a ""landmark victory"" for workers' rights, especially in the gig economy, a system of casual working which does not commit a business or a worker to set hours or rights. Maria Ludkin, the GMB's legal director, said: ""Uber must now face up to its responsibilities and give its workers the rights to which they are entitled. ""GMB urges the company not to waste everyone's time and money dragging their lost cause to the Supreme Court."" Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager, said: ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed. ""The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."" He went on to say that EAT's decision relied on an assertion that drivers were required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app, but, he said, ""as drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the UK"". He also said a number of changes had been made to the app over the last year, and that Uber had ""invested in things like access to illness and injury cover"".

"Police logged details of the boy's action under the heading ""Obscene Publications"" The mother of a schoolboy who sent a naked photo of himself to a girl has won the right to a judicial review over a police force's refusal to delete his name from its records. The boy, aged 14 at the time, was not arrested or prosecuted by Greater Manchester Police. His mother said she was concerned police could release the information to potential employers when he is older. The boy sent the naked photograph over social media to a girl at his school. The girl then shared the image, sent two years ago, with others. The boy's mother said she was ""in complete shock"" when she heard what had happened, but ""this had all happened in the privacy of his own bedroom"". She said even though ""he was young, he was naive, he was silly"" she believes the subsequent sharing of the photo by others was ""malicious"". Police took no action against him other than to record on their database that he had taken and forwarded an ""indecent"" image of himself, logged under a section entitled ""Obscene Publications"". Greater Manchester Police has refused to delete the boy's name from its files, a decision his mother is contesting at the High Court. She said: ""It's going to be held there infinitum, so for all his adult life it hangs over him."" Shauneen Lambe, chief executive of Just For Kids Law which is supporting the family, said a generation of children was being ""penalised"" by a law that was supposed to protect them. Home Office policy is understood to be that police have to record such incidents but whether their name is included is at the force's discretion, which may have implications for future job applications especially if working with children. Ms Lambe said the real fear about discretion was that it creates uncertainty, as one chief officer might take one view while another might take the opposite.

"The three victims have been taken to hospital A driver has ploughed into a group of pedestrians near the French city of Toulouse, injuring three Chinese exchange students. A 23-year-old woman was seriously injured, and two men aged 22 and 23 were also hurt, police said. The incident occurred outside a college in the suburb of Blagnac. The 28-year-old driver ""purposefully hit"" the group on a crosswalk, Toulouse prosecutor Pierre-Yves Couilleau said. The victims are students at the ICD-Toulouse International Business School. The woman's life is not in danger, police said. The driver was arrested immediately afterwards. Police said he had several previous minor convictions, some drugs-related. Unconfirmed reports say he had a history of mental illness including acute schizophrenia. La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi newspaper quoted him as telling police he had heard voices telling him to harm someone. Mr Couilleau visited the scene of the accident and said there was no suggestion the incident was an act of terrorism. ""What matters in this case is the psychiatric profile of the person,"" he said. The man ""had been planning this act for a month"", Mr Couilleau added. Toulouse Mayor Jean-Luc Moudenctweeted (in French),external: ""Very shocked by the aggression towards the students in Blagnac.

"Hillerman played the caretaker of Thomas Magnum's luxurious Hawaiian residence John Hillerman, the US actor who shot to fame as snooty English caretaker Higgins in Tom Selleck's '80s TV series Magnum PI, has died at the age of 84. Hillerman's publicist said he died of natural causes on Thursday at his home in Houston, Texas. Born in 1932, Hillerman started out on stage before landing small roles in such '70s classics as The Last Picture Show, Blazing Saddles and Chinatown. But he is best known for Magnum, which won him a Golden Globe and an Emmy. Hillerman beat several British actors to the Higgins role, which he once called ""the best gig I've ever had"". He proved so convincing that he once received a fan letter from the UK describing him as ""a credit to the Empire"". ""I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a hick from Texas,"" he would write back to fans who assumed he was British. The actor was last seen on screen playing a doctor in 1996 comedy A Very Brady Sequel. Larry Manetti, who played bar owner Orville ""Rick"" Wright in Magnum, remembered Hillerman on Twitter as a ""good friend"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The first episode of Mr Salmond's show will be broadcast next week Nicola Sturgeon has said she would have advised Alex Salmond against hosting a TV show on Russian state-funded broadcaster RT if she had been asked. RT has been described as a propaganda tool for Vladimir Putin's government, but Mr Salmond urged viewers to judge for themselves. Ms Sturgeon said the channel chosen by her predecessor as first minister would not have been her choice. And she said she would not shy away from criticising Russian policy. The Alex Salmond Show will be broadcast on RT - formerly known as Russia Today - every Thursday from next week. Salmond to host show on Russian broadcaster Mr Salmond, who led the SNP for a total of two decades and was Scotland's first minister for seven years, said the programme would include guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment. It will be produced by Mr Salmond's own Slainte Media company, which he set up with former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In her statement, current SNP leader Ms Sturgeon said she was ""sure Alex's show will make interesting viewing"". But she added: ""However, his choice of channel would not have been my choice. ""Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes, but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel to air what I am sure will be an entertaining show. ""Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticising Russian policy when we believe it is merited."" This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said the channel chosen by her predecessor as first minister would not have been her choice On Thursday, RT confirmed it would be registering with authorities in the US asan ""agent of the Russian state"",external- a description disputed by the broadcaster, which insists it has editorial independence. An assessment by US intelligence agencies in January stated that: ""The Kremlin staffs RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, recruiting people who can convey Russian strategic messaging because of their ideological beliefs.'' Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Salmond said: ""Over the last year or two, 50 Labour MPs - including the current Labour Party leader - 37 Conservative MPs and 17 SNP MPs have appeared on RT programmes. ""It would be a bit strange if I said, now that I'm no longer a member of parliament, that I'm refusing to make my own show with my own production company over which I have total editorial control, which is broadcast on RT."" The former SNP leader added: ""It would be a great idea if people watched the show, and if it is a good show and it has high production values and has interesting guests with interesting things to say then they should say it is a good show. ""And if it turns out to be Kremlin propaganda then people can slate me, but why don't they watch the show first?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The TV show has been inspired by Mr Salmond's recent Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, Alex Salmond Unleashed. Mr Salmond, who lost his Gordon seat to the Tories in June's general election, also hosts a radio show on the London-based LBC station, and has beenlinked to a potential takeover of the Johnston Press group, which includes the Scotsman and the i newspapers. Speaking a launch event in London, he said he wanted to hear from ""people of ideas and answers"" on his TV programme, and would give guests a platform to explain their ideas before facing questions. RT says it covers ""stories overlooked by the mainstream media, provides alternative perspectives on current affairs, and acquaints international audiences with a Russian viewpoint on major global events."" Aspokesman for the SNPsaid it was ""entirely a matter for Alex Salmond"", and that he was free to take on any opportunities he wanted now he was no longer an elected politician. The spokesman said the SNP had ""regularly expressed concern over actions by the Russian government, including reports of persecution on the grounds of race and sexuality, attacks on journalists and concerns about the integrity of the democratic process, and we will continue to pursue these concerns"". SNP MP Douglas Chapmantweeted at BBC presenter Andrew Neil that Mr Salmond had ""probably got fed up waiting for an offer from the UK propaganda machine... you know, the one you work for."" But political opponents have criticised Mr Salmond, withScottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlawsaying: ""It's clear that Alex Salmond's moral compass now points towards Vladimir Putin's corrupt regime in the Kremlin. ""It beggars belief that a man who led Scotland for seven years should be reduced to a puppet of Russia's deeply damaging propaganda unit."" Scottish Labour leadership candidate Anas Sarwarsaid the move demonstrated an ""astonishing lack of judgement"" by Mr Salmond, and called on Ms Sturgeon to ""condemn this shameful decision"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Renniesaid the former first minister ""fancies himself as the Michael Parkinson of Vladimir Putin's propaganda channel"". The Lib Dems have challenged Mr Salmond to interview opponents of Mr Putin, such as punk band Pussy Riot or Marina Litvinenko, the widow of murdered spy and dissident Alexander Litvinenko. AndLBC presenter Iain Dale tweeted: ""I try my best not to slag off @LBC colleagues but I'm going to make an exception. ""I accepted an invite to the launch of @AlexSalmond's new TV show.

"Householders who receive poor service from their telecoms provider are to get automatic compensation, the regulator Ofcom has announced. From 2019 they will get Â£8 a day if a fault is not fixed, paid as a refund through their bill. This is less than the Â£10 that was proposed when Ofcom began its consultation earlier this year. Providers will also have to pay Â£5 a day if their broadband or landline is not working on the day it was promised. If an engineer misses an appointment, they will have to give Â£25 in compensation. Ofcom has estimated as many as 2.6 million people could benefit from the new rules. The agreement covers consumers who have contracts with BT, Sky, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet - which make up around 90% of telecoms customers in the UK. Plusnet and EE are expected to join the scheme at a later date. Consumers will have to phone up to complain initially Service not working, and not fixed after two days: Â£8 compensation a day Missed engineer appointment, or less than 24 hours notice of cancellation: Â£25 for each appointment Delayed starting date: Â£5 a day ""Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough, without having to fight for compensation,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. ""So providers will have to pay money back automatically, whenever repairs or installations don't happen on time, or an engineer doesn't turn up. ""People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service."" Ofcom said the scheme would not come in to operation until early 2019, because of the complexity of the changes. It said that billing systems and online accounts would need to be altered, and staff would need to be re-trained. In total, customers can expect to get Â£142m in pay-outs every year, according to Ofcom's estimates. At the moment telecoms users can get compensation in theory, but only around 15% of those who complain manage to get a refund. Even then most only get small amounts, said Ofcom. Anyone wanting to obtain compensation under the current arrangements can find helpon the Ofcom website,external. Which? said that those providers who have not already joined the automatic compensation scheme should do so.

"Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of trying to murder his wife may be a ""pantomime villain driven by lust"" but he had no motive to kill, a jury has been told.

"Laura Plummer and her partner Omar Caboo A British woman being held in Egypt on drug smuggling charges says she had ""no idea"" the prescription painkillers she was carrying were banned there. Laura Plummer, 33, is due in court on Saturday accused of smuggling 300 tablets of Tramadol, a painkiller that is legal in the UK but not in Egypt. The shop assistant from Hull says they were given to her for her Egyptian boyfriend's ""back problems"". Local police says that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ms Plummer's relatives hope the judge at her custody hearing in the Red Sea Resort of Hurghada on Saturday will believe she made an innocent mistake - drug smuggling can be punishable by death in Egypt. Tramadol is legal in the UK with a prescription but banned in Egypt where many are addicted to the opiate. Ms Plummer told the BBC that a colleague had given her the tablets in a chemist's bag that she put in her suitcase. ""I didn't even look in bag,"" she said. ""I can't tell you how stupid I feel."" She said her cell in a police station was the size of her bedroom in the UK, but she was having to share it with 25 other women. She said her spirits were at rock bottom and she dreamt of coming home, catching up with her favourite soap opera Emmerdale, sleeping in her own bed, and having a cup of tea. She added her shared cell was claustrophobic, that it was sometimes hard to breathe and that although her fellow prisoners were trying to look after her, none of them spoke English.

"Rapper Giggs says his gigs have been cancelled because of the form A police form some grime artists say is being used as a ""racist"" way to target them is to be scrapped in London. Since 2005, promoters and licensees have been asked to complete a ""Form 696"" as a risk assessment for hosting music events with DJs and MCs. Some grime artists say they have been stopped from performing as a result. The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in ""serious incidents"" at music events. Safety standards have been raised in venues, police say, which led to the decision. Superintendent Roy Smith of the Met, said: ""It is clear that in recent years the landscape of the night time economy in London has changed and thankfully we have seen a reduction in serious incidents at promoted music events, particularly those involving firearms."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan had called for a review of the form's use earlier this year. The force said it would instead use a new ""voluntary partnership approach"" across the city. ""This will provide an excellent opportunity to share information at a local level and work to identify any enhanced risk to ensure the safety of the public,"" it said. Radio 4's John Humphrys raps along to Skepta In pictures: London's grime scene Lady Leshurr on why the genre's more popular than ever Know your UK rap from your grime? The Met said it had introduced the form in 2005 after a spate of shootings at a number of promoted club nights across London. Officers said the process helped to reduce crime and disorder, provided up-to-date information about promotions and encouraged venues, police, local authorities and promoters to share information better. But the form sparked complaints it was racist and was profiling certain groups and, in 2009, two questions were removed. Now, after carrying out a full review and consultation on it, the Met says it has recognised concerns raised within the industry including those being ""disproportionately affected"" by the assessment. UK Music said the form ""assumes music is a public order issue and potentially harmful"". It added the wording ""recommends the form should be completed if an event 'predominantly features DJs or MCs performing to a recorded backing track' which are obviously used heavily on the [grime, garage and bashment] genres"". Rapper Giggs had his tour cancelled in 2010 following police advice and artist P Money said he had been removed from gig line-ups as a direct result of information passed on via the form. Speaking tothe Victoria Derbyshire programmein March, he described the form as a ""race thing"". ""Why is it different? There's fights everywhere, there's situations everywhere at all types of shows, all types of things, whether its punk, rock, hip hop, pop, whatever,"" he said. UK Music welcomed the announcement on Twitter describing it as ""fantastic news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing neighbour to a 999 call operator in July 2016 A mental health patient who was found guilty of murdering his neighbour in a ""savage and sustained"" attack has been jailed for life. Kamil Ahmad's murder took place hours after Jeffrey Barry, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was released from a psychiatric hospital. It ended with Barry, 56, slicing off the Kurdish refugee's penis. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May said the decision to release Barry had been ""nothing short of calamitous"". Barry had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court. ""Once inside Mr Ahmad's flat, you subjected him to a frenzied attack, and the pathologist describes over 70 separate knife injuries,"" she said. ""Mr Ahmad bled to death. After he died, you cut off his penis and then you went downstairs and phoned the police."" Barry was told he would serve at least 23 years. The court was told Barry had stabbed his 49-year-old neighbour to death at his flat in Wells Road in Bristol at about 02:00 BST on 7 July 2016. Police found notes in Barry's flat Last month a jury unanimously convicted Barry, who is being held at Broadmoor Hospital, of murder following a two-week trial. Barry falsely claimed victim Mr Ahmad was a rapist and terrorist. The jury was told he was racist towards Iraqi-born Mr Ahmad and had previously assaulted him. A post-mortem examination found injuries to Mr Ahmad included 25 stab wounds to his face and eyes. Barry had told a community psychiatric nurse he was ""criminally insane"" in a phone call he made minutes before the fatal attack. But police discovered a note in his room reading: ""The fact is, I have acted out my entire psychiatric history. I'm very well. Sorry.""

"Theresa May has said the UK honours its commitments - but payment details remain vague So, here we are, poised to begin round six of Brexit talks, and it might move you to raise an eyebrow or two to hear that the two sides can't even agree what to call these meetings now: negotiating rounds, stock-taking exercises or an information exchange. These days I'd call them a dance around a standstill. UK negotiators have long been frustrated with the format of the (so far) monthly rounds of talks. They feel that sitting in Brussels for days at a stretch doesn't allow them the opportunity to consult London when an impasse is reached in order to - maybe - come up with a plan B and - hopefully - move forward. But EU negotiators ruled out a more flexible style of talks because, instead of consulting with one capital city, they've got 27 of them that would want to chip in, plus the European Parliament. Simply not practicable, they say. Perhaps then you won't fall off your chair in shock when I tell you expectations of round six of  - whatever these talks should be labelled as - are low on the Brussels side of the Channel. Yet that's not met here with a sea of EU shoulder shrugs. Quite the opposite. People I speak to are agitated. EU sources close to the negotiations have told me they believe the UK has only two weeks left to make progress on the Brexit divorce issues. Otherwise, I've been told, EU leaders are extremely unlikely to vote at their December summit to widen talks to include trade and transition deals - as the UK so dearly wants. David Davis says a lot of progress has been made Now there are three main divorce issues on the table: The rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa Irish borders Money the EU says the UK owes because of long and short-term financial commitments made while an EU member While the UK's chief negotiator David Davis insists a lot of progress has been made, his EU counterparts are less effusive. Imagine the three issues were traffic lights, citizens' rights would be green (although there are key issues still to be ironed out), Ireland would be amber and money would be a screaming, honking red. And frankly, money is what it boils down to. All 27 EU members agree that the UK must pay Some EU countries, such as Poland and Sweden, are keen to move on to talks of a future relationship with the UK - while others, like Germany and France, are more cautious. But there is unanimity amongst all 27 that the UK must pay. Brussels insists it doesn't need a precise figure right now. It does, however, want far more detail than what is perceived here as the vague promise Theresa May made in late September in her Florence speech that the UK is a country which honours its commitments. And why are there only two weeks left for the UK to move on the money, according to the EU? Because that is when the 27 EU capitals start discussing the draft conclusions to the leaders' summit which takes place mid-December. They need those two weeks to more or less agree a position. ""And there's no way they'll agree to talk trade or transition with the UK in December, if the money issue hasn't been put to bed beforehand. Forget it,"" a high-level contact told me. ""Then the Brexit situation becomes dramatic."" Because if the December summit comes and goes, the earliest talks of a future EU-UK relationship could start would be at the next EU leaders summit in March 2018. Far too late for businesses on both sides of the Channel which are desperate for some clarity. March 2018 would also be one year after the UK triggered Article 50 - the formal process to leave the EU. And it's six months from the time the EU wants to formally close Brexit negotiations in order to be able to vote on any agreement reached. ""All I know,"" a source close to the negotiations told me, ""is that I don't know the UK as I thought I did."" ""Are they so clouded by sex scandals and losing ministers in Westminster that they don't see: Brexit time is running out? ""They want a deal. Fine. Then now's the time to rip off the Band Aid. To admit to the UK public and the Conservative Party: 'We want to leave and it's time to pay'."" The EU wants a deal, too. Very much so.

"The future operation of the Irish border is one of the most sensitive Brexit issues There were ""frank discussions"" about the Irish border in the latest round of Brexit talks, David Davis has said. The Brexit Secretary was speaking in Brussels after a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Davis said any solution for the border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU tabled a paper which suggested Northern Ireland will have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border is to be avoided. 'Difficult to see' NI in single market The hardest border Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The paper hinted that Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there are to be no checks at the border. That is something which the Conservatives and DUP have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said the UK has two weeks to clarify what it will pay the EU if progress is to be made in Brexit talks. Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring Brexit does not undermine the Good Friday agreement. Neither want Brexit to lead to the emergence of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Let me be clear, we cannot have anything resulting in a new border being set up with in the UK,"" said Mr Davis after the sixth round of UK-EU talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". ""We remain firmly committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure. ""We respect the EU desires, but they cannot come at the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" Mr Davis said the EU and UK teams had drafted joint positions on the common travel area, as well as joint principles and commitments for the second phase of talks. The EU leaked paper stops short of saying a hard border can only be avoided by the UK or Northern Ireland staying in the single market or customs union. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was attending the British-Irish Council in Jersey However, it brings the commission closer to the European Parliament position which ""presumes"" that the UK or Northern Ireland will have to stay in the internal market and customs union. It is also the clearest indication that the commission has accepted the Irish position on Brexit and the border issue. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the only way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit is for the whole of the UK, or Northern Ireland, to follow the rules of the customs union and single market. Speaking at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Jersey, Mr Varadkar said his proposal would not mean the UK or Northern Ireland had to be members of the customs union and single market, but ""it would mean continuing to apply the rules"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has given the UK two weeks to clarify what it will pay to leave the EU DUP Parliamentary leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds rejected the suggestion that a hard border can only be avoided if the UK or Northern Ireland continue to abide by the rules of the single market and customs union after Brexit. He said the paper shows the EU is unwilling to engage in negotiations on the border issue in a ""meaningful fashion"". ""Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit,"" he said. ""Brussels must realise this and accept that progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics."" The DUP's Nigel Dodds said Brussels must accept progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said talk of individual countries vetoing a move to the next stage of Brexit negotiations is ""unhelpful"", but progress still had to be made on the border issue. ""There is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two,"" he told Irish state broadcaster, RTE. This video can not be played Bertie Ahern tells BBC Newsnight a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process Former Irish Taoiseach and Good Friday Agreement signatory Bertie Ahern told BBC Newsnight that a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process and that a physical border across the island of Ireland would give a ""huge incentive"" to those that want to cause mischief.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers on 5 April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of trying to murder his wife may be a ""pantomime villain driven by lust"" but he had no motive to kill, a jury has been told. Former Army officer Victoria Cilliers suffered multiple injuries in 2015 when her parachute failed to open and she fell 4,000ft (1,200m). Emile Cilliers is accused of tampering with the equipment to cause her death. The court heard he was an ""easy target"" to the prosecution because he had been unfaithful to his wife. In her closing statement at Winchester Crown Court, Mr Cilliers' defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC told the jury that the prosecution considered Cilliers a ""vile human being"" and treated him with ""scorn, sarcasm and theatricality"". She asked jurors to remember he was ""innocent until they were sure he was guilty"". Ms Marsh said: ""Mr Cilliers is an easy target, no Prince Charming, if anything the pantomime villain, unfaithful, lying to each of the women in his life, as one assumes 'needs must' if you are conducting any sort of affair."" Emile Cilliers is being represented by defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC She added that his dishonesty during his affairs had been ""driven by lust"" but did not mean he was lying in his account of what happened to his wife. ""Do not characterise lies to fan the flames of lust as someway a motive for a murder,"" she said. Ms Marsh also said that the suggested motive that he expected to receive his wife's estate if she died was ""utterly rubbish"". She explained that the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement which excluded the ""financially incontinent"" and ""penniless scoundrel"" from inheriting from his wife. Jurors were told Victoria Cilliers' survival was a ""near miracle"" Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries when her hired parachute malfunctioned and the reserve failed as she plummeted 4,000ft to the ground at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire on 5 April 2015. Jurors were told her survival was a ""near miracle"". The defendant denies tampering with his wife's hire kit in a toilet cubicle at the Army Parachute Association. The father-of-six also denies a second attempted murder charge relating to a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, and a third charge of damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life.

"This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing neighbour to a 999 call operator in July 2016 A mental health patient who was found guilty of murdering his neighbour in a ""savage and sustained"" attack has been jailed for life. Kamil Ahmad's murder took place hours after Jeffrey Barry, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was released from a psychiatric hospital. It ended with Barry, 56, slicing off the Kurdish refugee's penis. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May said the decision to release Barry had been ""nothing short of calamitous"". Barry had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court. ""Once inside Mr Ahmad's flat, you subjected him to a frenzied attack, and the pathologist describes over 70 separate knife injuries,"" she said. ""Mr Ahmad bled to death. After he died, you cut off his penis and then you went downstairs and phoned the police."" Barry was told he would serve at least 23 years. The court was told Barry had stabbed his 49-year-old neighbour to death at his flat in Wells Road in Bristol at about 02:00 BST on 7 July 2016. Police found notes in Barry's flat Last month a jury unanimously convicted Barry, who is being held at Broadmoor Hospital, of murder following a two-week trial. Barry falsely claimed victim Mr Ahmad was a rapist and terrorist. The jury was told he was racist towards Iraqi-born Mr Ahmad and had previously assaulted him. A post-mortem examination found injuries to Mr Ahmad included 25 stab wounds to his face and eyes. Barry had told a community psychiatric nurse he was ""criminally insane"" in a phone call he made minutes before the fatal attack.

"Police logged details of the boy's action under the heading ""Obscene Publications"" The mother of a schoolboy who sent a naked photo of himself to a girl has won the right to a judicial review over a police force's refusal to delete his name from its records. The boy, aged 14 at the time, was not arrested or prosecuted by Greater Manchester Police. His mother said she was concerned police could release the information to potential employers when he is older. The boy sent the naked photograph over social media to a girl at his school. The girl then shared the image, sent two years ago, with others. The boy's mother said she was ""in complete shock"" when she heard what had happened, but ""this had all happened in the privacy of his own bedroom"". She said even though ""he was young, he was naive, he was silly"" she believes the subsequent sharing of the photo by others was ""malicious"". Police took no action against him other than to record on their database that he had taken and forwarded an ""indecent"" image of himself, logged under a section entitled ""Obscene Publications"". Greater Manchester Police has refused to delete the boy's name from its files, a decision his mother is contesting at the High Court. She said: ""It's going to be held there infinitum, so for all his adult life it hangs over him."" Shauneen Lambe, chief executive of Just For Kids Law which is supporting the family, said a generation of children was being ""penalised"" by a law that was supposed to protect them. Home Office policy is understood to be that police have to record such incidents but whether their name is included is at the force's discretion, which may have implications for future job applications especially if working with children. Ms Lambe said the real fear about discretion was that it creates uncertainty, as one chief officer might take one view while another might take the opposite. Olivia Pinkney, the chief constable of Hampshire who is lead officer on the National Police Chief's Council (NPCC), expressed concern two years ago that the policy was not consistently applied and said she was""worried for today's young people"".,external Legal bid over teen's naked photo details HM Courts & Tribunal Service Just for Kids Law Greater Manchester Police Rookie cop who raced to 'tragic' 999 incident handed final written warning 'I need to make Â£19 - some nights I do, some nights I don't' Disruption on M66 northbound after 'police incident' Man sentenced as GMP secures biggest penalty in Bury domestic violence pilot scheme Why there are 45-minute delays and lane closures on A56 Stop-smoking service urges people to quit the habit in 2025 At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"A police force is facing a legal challenge against its refusal to delete the details of a teenager who sent a naked photograph of himself on social media to a girl at his school. The boy, 14 at the time, was not arrested or prosecuted by Greater Manchester Police. But his mother said she was concerned police could release the information to potential employers when he is older. The High Court is due to consider the case this morning. The boy used a messaging site to send a photo of his naked body to the girl, who then shared it with others, more than two years ago. His mother said she was ""in complete shock"" when she heard what had happened, but ""this had all happened in the privacy of his own bedroom"". She said even though ""he was young, he was naive, he was silly"" she believes the sharing of the photo was ""malicious"". Police took no action against him other than to record on their database that he had taken and forwarded an ""indecent"" image of himself, logged under a section entitled ""Obscene Publications"". Greater Manchester Police has refused to delete the boy's name from its files, a decision his mother is contesting at the court, which is sitting in Manchester. She said: ""It's going to be held there infinitum, so for all his adult life it hangs over him. ""I'm his parent and its my job to know when something needs to be dealt with and that's why I'm still pursuing proceedings to ultimately get his name removed. ""We are criminalising our children for something that if they did at the age of 18 is not a crime. ""The law hasn't kept up with technology.

"The future operation of the Irish border is one of the most sensitive Brexit issues There were ""frank discussions"" about the Irish border in the latest round of Brexit talks, David Davis has said. The Brexit Secretary was speaking in Brussels after a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Davis said any solution for the border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU tabled a paper which suggested Northern Ireland will have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border is to be avoided. 'Difficult to see' NI in single market The hardest border Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The paper hinted that Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there are to be no checks at the border. That is something which the Conservatives and DUP have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said the UK has two weeks to clarify what it will pay the EU if progress is to be made in Brexit talks. Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring Brexit does not undermine the Good Friday agreement. Neither want Brexit to lead to the emergence of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Let me be clear, we cannot have anything resulting in a new border being set up with in the UK,"" said Mr Davis after the sixth round of UK-EU talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". ""We remain firmly committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure. ""We respect the EU desires, but they cannot come at the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" Mr Davis said the EU and UK teams had drafted joint positions on the common travel area, as well as joint principles and commitments for the second phase of talks. The EU leaked paper stops short of saying a hard border can only be avoided by the UK or Northern Ireland staying in the single market or customs union. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was attending the British-Irish Council in Jersey However, it brings the commission closer to the European Parliament position which ""presumes"" that the UK or Northern Ireland will have to stay in the internal market and customs union. It is also the clearest indication that the commission has accepted the Irish position on Brexit and the border issue. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the only way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit is for the whole of the UK, or Northern Ireland, to follow the rules of the customs union and single market. Speaking at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Jersey, Mr Varadkar said his proposal would not mean the UK or Northern Ireland had to be members of the customs union and single market, but ""it would mean continuing to apply the rules"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has given the UK two weeks to clarify what it will pay to leave the EU DUP Parliamentary leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds rejected the suggestion that a hard border can only be avoided if the UK or Northern Ireland continue to abide by the rules of the single market and customs union after Brexit. He said the paper shows the EU is unwilling to engage in negotiations on the border issue in a ""meaningful fashion"". ""Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit,"" he said. ""Brussels must realise this and accept that progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics."" The DUP's Nigel Dodds said Brussels must accept progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said talk of individual countries vetoing a move to the next stage of Brexit negotiations is ""unhelpful"", but progress still had to be made on the border issue. ""There is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two,"" he told Irish state broadcaster, RTE. This video can not be played Bertie Ahern tells BBC Newsnight a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process Former Irish Taoiseach and Good Friday Agreement signatory Bertie Ahern told BBC Newsnight that a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process and that a physical border across the island of Ireland would give a ""huge incentive"" to those that want to cause mischief.

His spokesman later said his remarks had been ""in jest"". Mr Duterte has previouslysaid he killed criminal suspectsas mayor of the city of Davao. The Filipino leader is attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, alongside regional leaders andUS President Donald Trump. He has presided over a massive crackdown on crime in the Philippines, which critics allege undermines fundamental human rights. Mr Duterte has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drugs trade, and said he would ""be happy to slaughter"" three million drug addicts in the country. The woman who kills drug dealers for a living Duterte: The 'strongman' of the Philippines Addressing the Filipino community in Da Nang, he said he had killed a person during his violent teenage years, when he said he was in numerous fights and ""in and out of jail"".

Speaking about human rights during his Vietnam visit, Mr Duterte proposed a ""world summit"" on the issue - but not looking solely at human rights abuses in the Philippines. ""What makes the death of people in the Philippines more important than the rest of the children in the world that were massacred and killed?""the Manila Bulletin quoted him as saying,external.

"The gap in pay between men and women will take 100 years to close, a campaign group has warned. Campaigners highlight 10 November as the point in 2017 when a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts. But in some parts of the UK, the gender pay gap is so wide, it is as though women work unpaid from September. Vivienne Hayes, of the Women's Resource Centre, said progress had moved at a ""snail's pace"". Campaign group the Fawcett Society said that progress in closing the pay gap has ""stalled"". If the mean average pay gap for full time workers of 14.1% closes at the rate it has over the last five years, it won't reach 0% until 2117, it said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.Can't see the map?Click here,external The government wants large firms to disclose their pay gap, but will not force them to comply. Ms Hayes, chief executive of charity the Women's Resource Centre, said: ""We are here again, year after year lamenting the seemingly impervious issue of equal pay for men and women. ""Even though we have had a law since 1970 outlawing the practice of sex discrimination in pay, our progress is probably not even at a snail's pace."" There are different ways of calculating the pay gap. For example, for full time workers. the gap based on median hourly earnings has narrowed to its smallest for 20 years, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external, but was still 9.1% in 2017. Taking into account all workers, both full and part time, the median average gap has risen slightly from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% this year. In 183 out of 206 local authority areas, men in full time jobs earn more on average than women, but the gap varies from place to place. The top 10 includes the City of London and Tower Hamlets, which contains the financial area Canary Wharf. However, it is not a simple case of the gap being highest in the areas with the most lucrative jobs. Blaenau Gwent in Wales has the highest percentage gap between male and female full-time workers, with the average man on Â£14.07 an hour and average woman on Â£9.54, a difference of 32%. That is equivalent to women not being paid from 4 September. Knowsley in Merseyside, one of the most deprived areas of England, also appears in the top 10. Why is Essex best for top pay? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Does your job pay less than five years ago? Paid less than your colleagues?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Roger Smith from the Office for National Statistics said women tend to earn more in areas with a higher rate of people working in the public sector while the age of the workforce also played a part. The Fawcett Society said when higher earning jobs, more commonly held by men, are given more weight the average would mean effectively women stopped being paid from 10 November. Jemima Olchawski, of the society, said: ""One of the biggest gaps is in finance, which is why you'll see the City of London and Tower Hamlets high up. ""There will also be issues around care. Women still make up the vast majority of carers. So we need to see more support for fathers to take time out to be with their children or care for relatives."" Lawyer Linda Wong says financial penalties are needed when firms do not disclose their pay gap Linda Wong, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, said: ""The pay gap will persist unless there is commitment and consistency across the board."" The firm has been representing 17,000 former and current employees of Asda and 1,000 Sainsbury's workers in claims for equal pay. An employment tribunal found in 2016 that the Asda women, who mainly worked at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men working in warehouses. Lawyers said the difference in pay was between Â£1 and Â£3 an hour. Asda strongly disputed the claims and is appealing. It said the demands of the jobs were different. ""Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors,"" a spokeswoman said. Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars The gender pay gap at the BBC has also been exposed with men found to beearning an average of 9.3%more than women. However, Director General Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"" where the gap is higher. Female presenters have demanded ""real change"" by the end of 2017 after it was revealed two-thirds of stars on more than Â£150,000 a year were men. Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics If official figures say the gap is 9% and campaigners say it's 14%, is someone using a dodgy number? Not necessarily. Both figures come from theOffice for National Statistics,external. They use different averages. The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number. The 14% figure uses the mean average. The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values. If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much. The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society. Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December. There were 23 areas of the UK where women's average pay was greater than men's. This included Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, which have a high proportion of people out of work due to unemployment, sickness, disability or caring duties. However, they also included areas like Bexley, Havering and Sutton, which have low levels of unemployment. Across the UK, the average full-time male chief executive or senior official earns Â£48.53 an hour, or Â£93,960 a year. A woman in a similar role earns an average of Â£36.54 an hour, or Â£70,000 a year. The UK ranks 20th out of 144 countries around the world for closing the gender pay gap, but no country has absolute equality. In Iceland, which is ranked the best by the World Economic Forum, women walked out of their workplaces at 14:38 on 24 October 2016 in protest at the gap. According to unions, this was the time of day that women began working unpaid relative to men. Minister of state for apprenticeships, skills and women Anne Milton said the government had introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018. ""By shining a light on where there are gaps, they can take action to address it,"" she saidâ. ""There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."" Female workers won an equal pay claim against Birmingham City Council Women who worked for decades for Birmingham City Council celebrated when they were told they had won their battle for equal pay, but were angry it had ever had to go to court. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled the council would have to pay claims brought by former employees who earned less than male counterparts. The following year the council agreed to settle 11,000 claims. Pam Saunders spent almost 30 years with the authority and worked as a mobile home care assistant, helping people to wash, do their shopping and housework. She told the BBC in 2012: ""At the end of the day we did work hard for them. We really, really did and so why shouldn't they have paid us the right amount in the beginning?"" The BBC England Data Unit used the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings published by the Office for National Statistics and analysed the full time hourly median earnings, excluding overtime, for male and female workers in each local authority area to get the percentage gap between their earnings. We then calculated the dates on which the average female worker in each area effectively stops being paid, relative to male workers, because of the gap in their earnings.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump said he would put ""America first"" at the Apec summit US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have set out starkly different visions for the future of global trade in speeches at a summit in Vietnam. In a defiant address, Mr Trump told the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting that the US would no longer tolerate ""chronic trade abuses"". In contrast, President Xi said globalisation was irreversible. Mr Trump is currently on a five-nation Asia tour, with China one of his stops. Apec brings together 21 economies from the Pacific region - the equivalent of about 60% of the world's GDP. Since taking office, President Trump has pursued his ""America First"" agenda and pulled the US out of the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership -  a major trade deal with 12 Apec nations - arguing it would hurt US economic interests. ""Indo-Pacific"" - Trump's latest catchphrase Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on? The hidden messages in Trump's Asian menu In a speech in the Vietnamese port city of Da Nang on Friday, President Trump railed against the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade laws, and said it ""cannot function properly"" if all members do not respect the rules. He complained about trade imbalances, saying the US had lowered market barriers and ended tariffs while other countries had not reciprocated. ""Such practices hurt many people in our country,"" he said, adding that free trade had cost millions of American jobs. But he did not lay the blame on Apec countries, and instead accused earlier US administrations of not acting earlier to reverse the trend. He said America would make bilateral agreements with ""any Indo-Pacific partner here who abides by fair reciprocal trade"", but only ""on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit"". Xi Jinping is promoting China as the champion of free trade Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to the region as ""Indo-Pacific"", a term used to define America's new geopolitical view of Asia. Trump says trade deficit not China's fault The US president had travelled to Da Nang from Beijing, where he had also discussed America's huge trade imbalance with China. There too,he said he did not blame the country for ""taking advantage"". Mr Trump also met Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit. The two shook hands and exchanged a few words, Russian news agencies reported. Mr Trump and Mr Putin shook hands briefly Speaking minutes after his American counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping took to the podium to espouse his country's credentials as the new champion of world trade. Globalisation, he said, was an ""irreversible historical trend"" but the philosophy behind free trade needed to be repurposed to be ""more open, more balanced, more equitable and more beneficial to all"". In contrast to President Trump, the Chinese leader defended multilateral trade deals, which he said helped poorer nations to benefit. ""We should support the multilateral trading regime and practise open regionalism to allow developing members to benefit more from international trade and investment."" By Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent President Trump was clear - he wants bilateral trade deals and large, multilateral arrangements don't work for him. This was a speech saying that America is open for business, but on America's terms. Contrast that with China's Xi Jinping, who spoke about the digital economy, quantum science, artificial intelligence - presenting a vision of the future that is connected, and comprehensive. Increasingly whenever you see Mr Xi on the international stage he is the poster child for free trade and globalisation. Ironic, given that China itself has yet to become a fully free economy. The US was the architect of many of the multilateral and free trade agreements for Asia. Under its tutelage, many of these countries opened up and reformed - playing by America's rules. But under Donald Trump, that role has gone into reverse. Which has left China with a gaping hole to fill - and one it is only more than happy to take on. Read more from Karishma The total trade relationship between the US and China was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a nearly $310bn deficit. Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, thoughhe has since rowed back on such rhetoric. During the US president's visit on Thursday, China announced it would further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs. Deals worth $250bn (Â£190bn) were also announced, although it was unclear how much of that figure included past agreements or potential future deals. Trump vs Xi: The two men compared Before the Beijing talks, Mr Trump in Tokyo lashed out at Japan, saying it ""has been winning"" on trade in recent decades. Japan had a $69bn (Â£52.8bn) trade surplus with the US in 2016, according to the US Treasury department.

"The UK's industrial output grew at its fastest pace so far this year in September, according to official figures. Production rose by 0.7% compared with the month before, theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, boosted by machinery and equipment output. Separate data showed the UK'strade deficit in goods and services,externalnarrowed by more than expected in September. However, construction output fell by 1.6% in the month,the ONS said.,external The increase in industrial production was better than analysts' forecasts, and the fastest growth seen since December last year. Manufacturing output - a subset of industrial output - also rose by 0.7% in September. ""Industrial production has risen for six consecutive months, a feat last achieved 23 years ago,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. However, he added that the recovery in manufacturing output could be hit by recent rises in the oil price. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook for manufacturing appeared ""mixed"". Domestic conditions looked ""challenging despite recent decent demand"", he said. ""Increased prices for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods, weakened consumer purchasing power, and economic and political uncertainty threaten to hamper manufacturers. ""On the export side, a very competitive pound and healthy global demand are helping UK manufacturers competing in foreign markets. The weakened pound also appears to be encouraging some companies to switch to domestic sources for supplies."" The UK's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by Â£0.7bn between August and September 2017 to Â£2.75bn, mainly due to trade in goods exports increasing by Â£1.3bn. Despite this, the UK's trade performance during the third quarter as a whole worsened, according to the ONS data. In the three months to September 2017, the total UK trade deficit widened by Â£3bn to Â£9.5bn, mainly due to a increased imports, including of machinery, non-monetary gold and fuels. The construction output data was much weaker than expected. As well as the sharp fall in September from August, output was only up 1.1% from a year earlier - the weakest annual rate since March last year.

"Theresa May has outlined plans to set the UK's departure date and time from the EU in law, warning she will not ""tolerate"" any attempt to block Brexit. She said the EU Withdrawal Bill would be amended to formally commit to Brexit at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March 2019. The bill will be scrutinised by MPs next week - but the PM warned against attempts to stop it or slow it down. Mrs May waswriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalas a fresh round of Brexit negotiations are due to begin later. The UK is due to leave the European Union after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit. Gordon Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' Barnier: 'Time is pressing' in Brexit talks NI must 'abide by EU rules' to avoid hard border Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit ""on the front page"" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through. ""Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,"" she wrote. ""It will be there in black and white on the front page of this historic piece of legislation: the United Kingdom will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 at 11pm GMT."" The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage. Mrs May said most people wanted politicians to ""come together"" to negotiate a good Brexit deal, adding that MPs ""on all sides"" should help scrutinise the bill. She said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process. Post-Brexit trade proposals published Corbyn: Agree transition deal now Rudd: Brexit without deal 'unthinkable' ""We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this Bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union."" MPs have previously been told there have been 300 amendments and 54 new clauses proposed. David Davis is due to take part in a fresh round of Brexit negotiations The PM said the ""historic"" bill was ""fundamental to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit"" and would give ""the greatest possible clarity and certainty for all businesses and families across the country"". Labour MP and remain campaigner, Chuka Umunna, said many experts believed the March 2019 leaving date did not give much time for negotiations. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Lord Bridges said he could not see the government being able to negotiate the transition arrangement, like the bridge to us leaving, and the divorce bill, by 2019.  So we may actually need more time."" Lord Kerr, the former diplomat who helped draft Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the mechanism the UK has used to exit the EU - said putting the Brexit date on the bill did not mean the withdrawal process was irreversible. The cross-bench peer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that decisions such as these were being made in Westminster, and ""had nothing to do with the treaty, and they have nothing to do with the views of our partners in Brussels"". But the Conservative MP and leave campaigner, Peter Bone, welcomed the decision to enshrine the leaving date in law, saying it was a ""really big, important step"". It comesas a leaked account of a meeting of EU diplomats this weeksuggested that Northern Ireland may have to abide by the EU's rules on the customs union and single market after Brexit - in order to avoid the introduction of border checks. Both Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring that Brexit does not undermine the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement or lead to the emergence of hard-border with the Republic of Ireland. However, BBC correspondent Adam Fleming said the commission's suggestion appeared to be at odds with comments made by the Northern Ireland Secretary, James Brokenshire, this week. Mr Brokenshire said it was ""difficult to imagine"" Northern Ireland remaining in either the customs union or the single market after Brexit.

"The UK has two weeks to clarify key issues or make concessions if progress is to be made in Brexit talks, the bloc's chief negotiator has said. Michel Barnier was speaking after meeting the Brexit secretary for talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". David Davis said it was time for both sides ""to work to find solutions"". Before the talks, Theresa May said she wanted the UK's exit date set in law, and warned MPs not to block Brexit. Davis stands firm on Irish border issue May warns rebels as Brexit timing set out Brexit: All you need to know Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier suggested Britain would have to clarify its position in the next fortnight on what it would pay to settle its obligations to the EU if the talks were to have achieved ""sufficient progress"" ahead of December's European Council meeting. ""It is just a matter of settling accounts as in any separation,"" Mr Barnier said. Mr Barnier also said both sides had to work towards an ""objective interpretation"" of Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge that no member of the EU would lose out financially as a result of the Brexit vote. The Brexit secretary insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a ""few outstanding, albeit important, issues"". This video can not be played David Davis says there cannot be a new border within the UK Mr Davis and Mr Barnier agreed there had been progress on the issue of settled status for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. Mr Barnier said the UK had provided ""useful clarifications"" on guaranteeing rights, although more work needed to be done on some points including rights of families and exporting welfare payments. For the UK's part, Mr Davis said, the government had ""listened carefully"" to concerns and that there would be a ""streamlined and straightforward"" process for EU nationals to obtain settled status. ButMr Davis rejected a suggestion that Northern Ireland could remain within the European customs union. He was responding to a European Commission paper, which proposed that Northern Ireland may have to remain a member of the EU's single market or customs union, if a so-called ""hard border"" with the Irish Republic is to be avoided. Reality Check: Where are we really with Brexit? Brexit is 'getting dramatic', says EU Saying there had been ""frank discussions"" with Mr Barnier and his negotiators on the issue of the Irish border, Mr Davis insisted there could be ""no new border"" inside the UK. ""We respect the European Union desire to protect the legal order of the single market and the customs union, but that cannot come at cost to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" Mr Davis told reporters in Brussels. ""We recognise the need for specific solutions for the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.  But let me be clear - this cannot amount to creating a new border inside our United Kingdom,"" he added. Mr Barnier said the ""unique situation"" on the island of Ireland required ""technical and regulatory solutions necessary to prevent a hard border"". By Adam Fleming, BBC Europe correspondent Michel Barnier usually says at post-negotiation press conferences that the clock is ticking. He didn't this time: he gave a specific timeframe. He wants the UK to provide more clarity in the next two weeks on its positions on the rights of EU citizens who wish to remain after Brexit, the plans for the Irish border and principles for calculating Britain's financial obligations. Although the EU doesn't want a precise figure, it wants the UK to clarify what it's willing to pay to live up to the financial commitments made as a member. On Ireland, both sides have pledged to protect the peace process but the EU has suggested that might require Northern Ireland sticking to European rules on customs and the single market - rules that the rest of Britain might not follow in future. David Davis rejected that. UK sources agree it looks like they've been set a deadline but they feel it is a logical reading of the EU's timetable, under which their officials have to begin preparations for the next summit of EU leaders in December fairly soon. Looking ahead to December's EU summit, Mr Davis pledged the UK was ""ready and willing"" to engage with Brussels ""as often and as quickly as needed"". ""But we need to see flexibility, imagination and willingness to make progress on both sides if these negotiations are to succeed and we are able to realise our new deep and special partnership,"" he said. Friday's update came as Prime Minister Theresa May announced she wanted the date the UK leaves the EU - 29 March 2019 - enshrined in law. The prime minister wrote in Friday's Daily Telegraph she would not tolerate attempts to ""block"" Brexit The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit ""on the front page"" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through. ""Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,"" she wrote. The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage. Mrs May said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process. ""We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union.""

"Nicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of leaving devolved administrations ""substantially in the dark"" on key Brexit talks. The first minister's comments come ahead of a meeting of the British Irish Council in Jersey. She called on the UK government to make good on its promise to give the devolved administrations a ""genuine role"" in discussions. The UK government said there had been an unprecedented level of engagement. Ms Sturgeon will attend the British Irish Council with Scottish Brexit minster Mike Russell and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop. The First Secretary of State Damien Green will represent the UK government. The first minister is seeking urgent clarity on what kind of transition arrangements are planned for sectors like agriculture and fisheries. Ahead of the meeting, she claimed the devolved administrations had been ""cut out"" of the talks. Damien Green will represent the UK government at the meeting She said: ""In less than 18 months' time, the UK will be leaving the EU, but despite reassurances that all devolved administrations will be consulted on the withdrawal negotiations, we remain substantially in the dark. ""The UK government assured us that the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) would seek to agree UK positions and discuss issues stemming from the negotiations, respecting the devolved competencies, but the UK government then allowed that process to fall short of what is required."" She added that there had only been one meeting of the JMC on EU negotiations since talks began on 19 June. ""This is not an abstract debate about process,"" she said. ""Leaving the EU will have an enormous impact on Scottish jobs, our economy and our relationship with the world - indeed, Brexit's effects are already being felt. ""We know from businesses in Scotland that a hard Brexit will cause serious and long-term economic damage and it is crucial we stay in the single market and customs union. ""As has previously been said, the clock is ticking on Brexit and it is essential that the UK government live up to its promises to give devolved administrations a genuine role on what is by far the most important issue facing every corner of these islands."" A UK government spokesman said: ""These comments come just weeks after an agreement was made at a Joint Ministerial Committee between the UK government and the devolved administrations, including the Scottish government, on the principles that will underpin the process for bringing back powers from the EU to the UK. ""There has been an unprecedented level of engagement between ministers and officials in devolved administrations which will continue. We are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire UK, including Scotland.""

"The future operation of the Irish border is one of the most sensitive Brexit issues There were ""frank discussions"" about the Irish border in the latest round of Brexit talks, David Davis has said. The Brexit Secretary was speaking in Brussels after a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Davis said any solution for the border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU tabled a paper which suggested Northern Ireland will have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border is to be avoided. 'Difficult to see' NI in single market The hardest border Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The paper hinted that Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there are to be no checks at the border. That is something which the Conservatives and DUP have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said the UK has two weeks to clarify what it will pay the EU if progress is to be made in Brexit talks. Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring Brexit does not undermine the Good Friday agreement. Neither want Brexit to lead to the emergence of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Let me be clear, we cannot have anything resulting in a new border being set up with in the UK,"" said Mr Davis after the sixth round of UK-EU talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". ""We remain firmly committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure. ""We respect the EU desires, but they cannot come at the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" Mr Davis said the EU and UK teams had drafted joint positions on the common travel area, as well as joint principles and commitments for the second phase of talks. The EU leaked paper stops short of saying a hard border can only be avoided by the UK or Northern Ireland staying in the single market or customs union. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was attending the British-Irish Council in Jersey However, it brings the commission closer to the European Parliament position which ""presumes"" that the UK or Northern Ireland will have to stay in the internal market and customs union. It is also the clearest indication that the commission has accepted the Irish position on Brexit and the border issue. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the only way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit is for the whole of the UK, or Northern Ireland, to follow the rules of the customs union and single market. Speaking at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Jersey, Mr Varadkar said his proposal would not mean the UK or Northern Ireland had to be members of the customs union and single market, but ""it would mean continuing to apply the rules"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has given the UK two weeks to clarify what it will pay to leave the EU DUP Parliamentary leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds rejected the suggestion that a hard border can only be avoided if the UK or Northern Ireland continue to abide by the rules of the single market and customs union after Brexit. He said the paper shows the EU is unwilling to engage in negotiations on the border issue in a ""meaningful fashion"". ""Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit,"" he said. ""Brussels must realise this and accept that progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics."" The DUP's Nigel Dodds said Brussels must accept progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said talk of individual countries vetoing a move to the next stage of Brexit negotiations is ""unhelpful"", but progress still had to be made on the border issue. ""There is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two,"" he told Irish state broadcaster, RTE. This video can not be played Bertie Ahern tells BBC Newsnight a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process Former Irish Taoiseach and Good Friday Agreement signatory Bertie Ahern told BBC Newsnight that a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process and that a physical border across the island of Ireland would give a ""huge incentive"" to those that want to cause mischief.

"This video can not be played Gordon Brown warns of Brexit 'crisis point' The UK could remain in the EU if Leave voters could be offered a ""game-changing"" deal next summer, Gordon Brown has told BBC News. The former Labour prime minister told Laura Kuenssberg he was not arguing for a second EU referendum ""at this stage"". But he predicted a ""crisis point"", when Leave voters realised they were not going to get what they were promised. And they might be persuaded to change their mind if they were given ""new evidence"", he said. The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019, after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit. Barnier: 'Time pressing' in Brexit talks We want our Brexit cash boost - NHS boss ""Is there something that we didn't get right the last time that could persuade millions of Leave voters that it was worth going Remain?"" Mr Brown, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said. He predicted it would become clear by next summer that the UK was not going to get ""proper control"" of its borders, trade and laws, saying: ""We will still be governed in many ways by the European Court of Justice."" And he said the UK would not get its money back in the way the Leave campaign had claimed, ""including the Â£350m a week for the National Health Service"". ""I would not try to tell people that they were wrong,"" he said, stressing people had voted Leave for ""very real reasons"" that had to be ""respected"". But, he said, there ""may be scope for a reassessment"" next summer. Brexit negotiations are continuing but EU sources told the BBC on Thursday that the UK had only two weeks left to make progress on so-called withdrawal issues such as the so-called ""divorce bill"" - the amount the UK will pay to settle its financial obligations. Other sticking points include the Northern Ireland border and citizens' rights. If a deal is to be ratified by the various national and regional parliaments by March 2019 - EU negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested one will need to be agreed by October 2018. Mr Brown was not specific about what a ""game-changing"" offer might entail, but he said the mood was changing in the EU, which would have to agree to any new offer. ""You'd have to be able to say something about migration, about the courts, about money - but I think that is the point at which the nation should be given new information about what is possible. So, I'm not advocating a referendum at this stage,"" he said. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Gordon Brown Mr Brown, who is promoting his new memoir, My Life, Our Times, also warned that Scotland could become the next Catalonia, with two ""opposing extremes"" pulling the nation apart. He argued for a ""middle way"" between the SNP's demand for full independence and what he said was the Conservative Party's belief in maintaining the ""status quo"". The answer, he said, was to move to a ""federalist UK with maximum autonomy for Scotland"". Mr Brown also called for more action on tax havens and hit back at claims he had agitated for then Prime Minister Tony Blair's removal when he was chancellor, insisting that any disagreements they had had been about policies rather than personalities. He added he believed political leaders had a ""shelf life"" of about six years and it was an ""aberration"" that he had been able to survive at the top for 13 years, including his time at the Treasury and Number 10.

"This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing neighbour to a 999 call operator in July 2016 A mental health patient who was found guilty of murdering his neighbour in a ""savage and sustained"" attack has been jailed for life. Kamil Ahmad's murder took place hours after Jeffrey Barry, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was released from a psychiatric hospital. It ended with Barry, 56, slicing off the Kurdish refugee's penis. Sentencing, Mrs Justice May said the decision to release Barry had been ""nothing short of calamitous"". Barry had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court. ""Once inside Mr Ahmad's flat, you subjected him to a frenzied attack, and the pathologist describes over 70 separate knife injuries,"" she said. ""Mr Ahmad bled to death. After he died, you cut off his penis and then you went downstairs and phoned the police."" Barry was told he would serve at least 23 years. The court was told Barry had stabbed his 49-year-old neighbour to death at his flat in Wells Road in Bristol at about 02:00 BST on 7 July 2016. Police found notes in Barry's flat Last month a jury unanimously convicted Barry, who is being held at Broadmoor Hospital, of murder following a two-week trial. Barry falsely claimed victim Mr Ahmad was a rapist and terrorist. The jury was told he was racist towards Iraqi-born Mr Ahmad and had previously assaulted him. A post-mortem examination found injuries to Mr Ahmad included 25 stab wounds to his face and eyes. Barry had told a community psychiatric nurse he was ""criminally insane"" in a phone call he made minutes before the fatal attack. But police discovered a note in his room reading: ""The fact is, I have acted out my entire psychiatric history. I'm very well. Sorry.""

"Universities are going to be given tougher guidance on their advertising claims Universities are going to face a crackdown on how they advertise and market courses to attract students. With hundreds of thousands of young people in the process of applying, universities are going to be warned by the advertising watchdog that they need to prove the accuracy of their claims. It is expected that universities will be told not to mislead or exaggerate in language used in adverts for students. They will scrutinise claims such as being in the ""top 1%"". The University of Reading has already had to take down its claim to be the top 1% of the world's universities, because it could not be objectively substantiated. Next week the Advertising Standards Authority is expected to identify up to six more universities which have breached the advertising code - along with issuing tougher guidelines on what is permissible language in marketing. The University of Reading had to stop saying it was in the top 1% in the world It has emerged that two universities have already agreed to clarify advertising. The watchdog says the University of Bedfordshire faced a complaint about claiming to have ""gold standard"" teaching quality - when the university held a silver award in the new teaching excellence ratings. Liverpool John Moores University was challenged over being more specific about its claim to be ""university of the year"". It won the title in this year's ""Educate North Awards"". Universities are competing for students and their fee income and have been putting increasing efforts into how they appeal to potential applicants, selling  marketing information on websites and on open days. There has been a proliferation of league tables and rankings which are used to base claims about ""world class"" status for universities or individual degree courses. The advertising watchdog has been considering whether university claims are justified by any ""objective substantiation"" - and without ""adequate substantiation"", can rule them to be ""misleading"". If advertisers persistently refuse to accept rulings from the watchdog, they can be referred to trading standards officers, who could impose fines. But the advertising watchdog says advertisers are more likely to comply rather than face ""bad publicity"". The University of Reading was told in the summer that it could be ""materially misleading"" to market itself as being in the top 1% of all world universities - a claim made by several other UK universities. The claim had been based on Reading's ranking in a number of international league tables - but without a clear agreement over how many universities there are in the world, such a claim was deemed as unacceptable. The university agreed to remove the claim and the complaint was ""informally resolved"" without a formal investigation or ruling. But it is understood that the issue was then raised with wider university representative groups - because many universities make such specific claims about their international reputations.

They were affected by a chemical at a flat in north Oxford on Thursday and kept in hospital overnight. Hamad Nejad, 34, from Oxford, appeared at Oxford Magistrates' Court earlier and was remanded in custody. He is also charged with one count of intimidating a witness. Five other officers also experienced ""minor irritation"" as a result of the substance at the flat on Elizabeth Jennings Way. Surrounding flats on the street were evacuated as a precaution but residents have been able to return after tests showed there was no risk.

"A Mauritian company owns Mr O'Toole's mansion in Northumberland More than 100 UK millionaires have been identified as tax dodgers after hiding their wealth using offshore schemes. Documents in theParadise Papersleak show the identities of taxpayers who moved assets worth tens of millions of pounds into companies in Mauritius. The tax avoidance schemes involve them claiming to no longer own property, cash and investments in order to keep their fortunes out of reach of HMRC.

Mark Faulkner and his partner Harriet Logan moved more than Â£28m in cash and assets to a Mauritian company called Babington PCC.

"Walt Disney has announced a deal to make three new Star Wars movies. The company said it had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of the upcoming ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", to create a new trilogy of the science fiction blockbuster. Disney is also working on a live-action Star Wars series for a new online streaming service. The news overshadowed Disney's first drop in annual profits since 2009, amid steep competition from online rivals. Profits for the year to September fell 4% to $8.98bn (Â£6.8bn). Disney's shares fell initially in after-hours trading on the release of its results, but they then rallied to 1% higher on news of the new Star Wars movies. Chief executive Bob Iger said: ""We remain optimistic about our future, in part because quality truly does matter."" The entertainment giant also plans to launch a sports-focused ESPN+ app in the spring, and a Disney streaming service in 2019. Mr Iger said those investments, which add to an existing Disney subscription service in Europe, were ""vital"" to the firm's future. ""Our goal here is to be a viable player in the direct-to-consumer space, a space that we all know is a very compelling space to be in,"" he said. He declined to address reports that the company had held talks with 21st Century Fox about acquiring parts of its business, but he did not rule out an acquisition. ""I don't think there's ever such a thing as having too much quality."" Disney is grappling with a challenge from online video, which has won viewers of traditional television and movies and is driving a shift away from cable television. In the fourth quarter of Disney's financial year, covering the three months to the end of September, profits dipped 1% to $1.7bn. Quarterly revenues fell 3% to $12.8bn as the impact of hurricanes, lower advertising revenue and a decline in cable subscriptions weighed on the results. Revenue in its movie division sank 21%, which Disney said was due to a tough comparison with last year, when a new Star Wars movie lifted results. Disney's parks and resorts business, which has steadied results in recent quarters, was the only division that reported year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter, rising 6%. But even that unit was affected by the hurricanes that struck the US earlier this year. Disney said that accounted for a roughly 3% decline in US attendance.

"The current HPV vaccine is given in two doses Women vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) - thought to cause about 99% of cervical cancers - may only need three smear tests in their lifetime, a new study suggests. Since 2008, the HPV vaccine has been offered to girls aged 11 to 13. Reported cases of HPV have fallen sharply since then. A team from Queen Mary University of London found that screenings at age 30, 40 and 55 would offer the same benefit to these young women as the current 12. Prof Peter Sasieni, the lead author of the study, said cutting the number of smear tests for vaccinated women would make sense and save money. ""These women are far less likely to develop cervical cancer so they don't need such stringent routine checking as those at a higher risk,"" he said. ""This decision would free up resources for where they are needed most. The change in the screening system is a unique opportunity to reassess how often women are invited for cervical screens during their lifetimes."" The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer and funded by Cancer Research UK, comes ahead of changes being planned to the screening programme in England for 2019 and similar adjustments in Scotland and Wales. At the moment, labs test for abnormalities in cells taken in a smear test but the new tests will check for the presence of HPV first and only check for abnormal cells if the virus is found. The study says that when the new HPV testing first comes in, unvaccinated women should only need seven screenings in their lifetime, instead of 12. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said it was ""great news"" for women. ""While we hope to see these improvements to the screening programme in the future, it's important that women continue to take up invitations for cervical screening."" Sarah Farr with her daughter Maisie, who is seven Sarah Farr, 34, from Barrow in Cumbria, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in November 2016. Her cancer was picked up early through a screening - she had surgery to remove the cancer and didn't need any further treatment. She is very glad her seven-year-old daughter Maisie will be able to get innoculated and experience fewer screenings. ""Cervical screening can be quite an uncomfortable experience, but I'm forever grateful that the test spotted my cancer early. ""It would be great if Maisie doesn't have to have to go for screening as often as I did, because of the HPV jab and the new screening test."" Cervical cancer is one of the most deadly but most preventable forms of cancer in women It is the most common cancer in women under 35 Around 3,000 cases are diagnosed every year in the UK and it causes 900 deaths Public Health England says almost all the deaths are of older women who did not benefit from the HPV vaccination programme Currently 85% of eligible girls are immunised and HPV vaccine rates in England are among the world's highest The vaccine could save several hundred lives every year and also provide protection against other cancers and genital warts Women aged 25 to 64 are automatically invited for cervical screening, which detects abnormal cell changes in the cervix Source: Public Health England Testing for HPV first will be rolled out into the English cervical screening programme over the next two years. A new HPV vaccine is also expected to be introduced at some point from 2019. It should have a 90% success rate - up from 70% for the current vaccine. With this new vaccine, the researchers believe vaccinated women will only need two smear tests in their lifetime. Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said while it is positive to see a potential reduction in screenings needed, focus must continue on increasing the uptake of the vaccination and screening programmes to ensure more women are able to benefit from these advances. ""We would urge the government to use any savings made as a result of reduced screening intervals to fund a national cervical screening awareness campaign. ""If we do not reverse falling screening attendance we will simply be faced with more lives lost to the disease which could have been prevented."" In July, immunisation experts decided there was little evidence to justify giving boys the HPV vaccine because high uptake among girls would reduce everyone's risk of HPV infection - butcritics said the decision was concerning. The HPV vaccine works best if girls get it before they come into contact with HPV - in other words, before they become sexually active. That is why getting the vaccine during the teenage years is recommended. However, girls who have already had sex should still have the vaccine if they are in the relevant age group. Girls can have the HPV vaccination on the NHS up to their 18th birthday but they will need three doses, rather than the normal two, in order to be fully protected if they are over 15. If you are not eligible for the vaccine, experts say the best protection against cervical cancer is to continue going for regular cervical screenings. In the UK, women are invited for screening between the ages of 25 and 64, every few years.

"The gap in pay between men and women will take 100 years to close, a campaign group has warned. Campaigners highlight 10 November as the point in 2017 when a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts. But in some parts of the UK, the gender pay gap is so wide, it is as though women work unpaid from September. Vivienne Hayes, of the Women's Resource Centre, said progress had moved at a ""snail's pace"". Campaign group the Fawcett Society said that progress in closing the pay gap has ""stalled"". If the mean average pay gap for full time workers of 14.1% closes at the rate it has over the last five years, it won't reach 0% until 2117, it said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.Can't see the map?Click here,external The government wants large firms to disclose their pay gap, but will not force them to comply. Ms Hayes, chief executive of charity the Women's Resource Centre, said: ""We are here again, year after year lamenting the seemingly impervious issue of equal pay for men and women. ""Even though we have had a law since 1970 outlawing the practice of sex discrimination in pay, our progress is probably not even at a snail's pace."" There are different ways of calculating the pay gap. For example, for full time workers. the gap based on median hourly earnings has narrowed to its smallest for 20 years, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external, but was still 9.1% in 2017. Taking into account all workers, both full and part time, the median average gap has risen slightly from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% this year. In 183 out of 206 local authority areas, men in full time jobs earn more on average than women, but the gap varies from place to place. The top 10 includes the City of London and Tower Hamlets, which contains the financial area Canary Wharf. However, it is not a simple case of the gap being highest in the areas with the most lucrative jobs. Blaenau Gwent in Wales has the highest percentage gap between male and female full-time workers, with the average man on Â£14.07 an hour and average woman on Â£9.54, a difference of 32%. That is equivalent to women not being paid from 4 September. Knowsley in Merseyside, one of the most deprived areas of England, also appears in the top 10. Why is Essex best for top pay? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Does your job pay less than five years ago? Paid less than your colleagues?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Roger Smith from the Office for National Statistics said women tend to earn more in areas with a higher rate of people working in the public sector while the age of the workforce also played a part. The Fawcett Society said when higher earning jobs, more commonly held by men, are given more weight the average would mean effectively women stopped being paid from 10 November. Jemima Olchawski, of the society, said: ""One of the biggest gaps is in finance, which is why you'll see the City of London and Tower Hamlets high up. ""There will also be issues around care. Women still make up the vast majority of carers. So we need to see more support for fathers to take time out to be with their children or care for relatives."" Lawyer Linda Wong says financial penalties are needed when firms do not disclose their pay gap Linda Wong, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, said: ""The pay gap will persist unless there is commitment and consistency across the board."" The firm has been representing 17,000 former and current employees of Asda and 1,000 Sainsbury's workers in claims for equal pay. An employment tribunal found in 2016 that the Asda women, who mainly worked at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men working in warehouses. Lawyers said the difference in pay was between Â£1 and Â£3 an hour. Asda strongly disputed the claims and is appealing. It said the demands of the jobs were different. ""Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors,"" a spokeswoman said. Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars The gender pay gap at the BBC has also been exposed with men found to beearning an average of 9.3%more than women. However, Director General Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"" where the gap is higher. Female presenters have demanded ""real change"" by the end of 2017 after it was revealed two-thirds of stars on more than Â£150,000 a year were men. Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics If official figures say the gap is 9% and campaigners say it's 14%, is someone using a dodgy number? Not necessarily. Both figures come from theOffice for National Statistics,external. They use different averages. The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number. The 14% figure uses the mean average. The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values. If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much. The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society. Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December. There were 23 areas of the UK where women's average pay was greater than men's. This included Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, which have a high proportion of people out of work due to unemployment, sickness, disability or caring duties. However, they also included areas like Bexley, Havering and Sutton, which have low levels of unemployment. Across the UK, the average full-time male chief executive or senior official earns Â£48.53 an hour, or Â£93,960 a year. A woman in a similar role earns an average of Â£36.54 an hour, or Â£70,000 a year. The UK ranks 20th out of 144 countries around the world for closing the gender pay gap, but no country has absolute equality. In Iceland, which is ranked the best by the World Economic Forum, women walked out of their workplaces at 14:38 on 24 October 2016 in protest at the gap. According to unions, this was the time of day that women began working unpaid relative to men. Minister of state for apprenticeships, skills and women Anne Milton said the government had introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018. ""By shining a light on where there are gaps, they can take action to address it,"" she saidâ. ""There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."" Female workers won an equal pay claim against Birmingham City Council Women who worked for decades for Birmingham City Council celebrated when they were told they had won their battle for equal pay, but were angry it had ever had to go to court. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled the council would have to pay claims brought by former employees who earned less than male counterparts. The following year the council agreed to settle 11,000 claims. Pam Saunders spent almost 30 years with the authority and worked as a mobile home care assistant, helping people to wash, do their shopping and housework. She told the BBC in 2012: ""At the end of the day we did work hard for them. We really, really did and so why shouldn't they have paid us the right amount in the beginning?"" The BBC England Data Unit used the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings published by the Office for National Statistics and analysed the full time hourly median earnings, excluding overtime, for male and female workers in each local authority area to get the percentage gap between their earnings. We then calculated the dates on which the average female worker in each area effectively stops being paid, relative to male workers, because of the gap in their earnings.

"Louis CK's planned appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has also been cancelled US comedian Louis CK's movie premiere has been cancelled hours before the screening as five women levelled sexual misconduct allegations against him. Four of the accusers told the New York Times he had masturbated during interactions with them and a fifth said he had asked to do so. The BBC has contacted the Emmy-winning comic's manager for a comment. The distributor of his new film, I Love You, Daddy, said it was reviewing plans for its general release. Four comediennes - Dana Min Goodman, Julia Wolov, Rebecca Corry and Abby Schachner - and a fifth woman who spoke on condition of anonymity made allegations about the entertainerin Thursday's New York Times report.,external Ms Goodman and Ms Wolov said Louis CK stripped naked and masturbated after inviting them to his hotel room during the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002. Actresses Julia Wolov (L) and Dana Goodman in Hollywood in 2011 Ms Corry told the newspaper that the comic was a guest star on a TV pilot she was appearing on in 2005 when he asked if he could go to her dressing room so she could watch him perform a sex act on himself. She said she rebuked him and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. Ms Schachner said she called Louis CK in 2003 to invite him to one of her shows and was dumbfounded to realise during their phone conversation that he was masturbating. ""I felt very ashamed,"" she told the New York Times. A fifth woman, who did not want to be named, told the newspaper of alleged incidents involving the comic in the late 1990s while she was working in production on The Chris Rock Show. Louis CK, who was a writer and producer on the show, repeatedly asked her to watch him perform a sex act, she said. A question mark now hangs over the general release of the comedian's new film The accuser told the New York Times she went along with his requests even though she knew it was wrong. ""He abused his power,"" she said. The premiere of Louis CK's new movie in New York City on Thursday night was abruptly called off. I Love You, Daddy was written and directed by Louis CK, who also stars in the film as a father who tries to stop his 17-year-old daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) from having a relationship with a seedy 68-year-old film director (John Malkovich). Rebecca Corry said Louis CK asked if he could go to her dressing room so she could watch him perform a sex act The movie's distributor, the Orchard, has not confirmed that it will go ahead with its release date in cinemas on 17 November. ""In light of the allegations considering Louis CK references in today's New York Times, we are cancelling tonight's premiere of I Love You, Daddy,"" the Orchard said in a statement to industry publications. ""There is never a place for the behaviour detailed in these allegations. ""As a result, we are giving careful consideration to the timing and release of the film and continuing to review the situation."" ""I felt very ashamed,"" Abby Schachner told the New York Times Louis CK's planned appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has also been cancelled. On Thursday night, HBO announced it would purge Louis CK's past projects from its On Demand service. The cable TV network also said the comic would no longer participate in a charity comedy special, Night of Too Many Stars, later this month. In September at the Toronto film festival, where I Love You, Daddy, was shown, the New York Times said it had asked Louis CK about claims of sexual misconduct against him. The divorced father of two daughters dismissed the reports as ""rumours"". Louis CK joins a growing list of Hollywood figures including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner and James Toback who have been engulfed by such allegations. On Thursday, a Los Angeles County district attorney Jackie Lacey announced a task force of veteran sex crimes prosecutors to address ""the widespread allegations of sexual abuse in entertainment industry"".

"Seven police officers were affected by a substance while making an arrest A man has been charged with administering a poison with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm after two police officers were injured during an arrest. They were affected by a chemical at a flat in north Oxford on Thursday and kept in hospital overnight. Hamad Nejad, 34, from Oxford, appeared at Oxford Magistrates' Court earlier and was remanded in custody. He is also charged with one count of intimidating a witness. Five other officers also experienced ""minor irritation"" as a result of the substance at the flat on Elizabeth Jennings Way. Surrounding flats on the street were evacuated as a precaution but residents have been able to return after tests showed there was no risk.

"Walt Disney has announced a deal to make three new Star Wars movies. The company said it had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of the upcoming ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", to create a new trilogy of the science fiction blockbuster. Disney is also working on a live-action Star Wars series for a new online streaming service. The news overshadowed Disney's first drop in annual profits since 2009, amid steep competition from online rivals. Profits for the year to September fell 4% to $8.98bn (Â£6.8bn). Disney's shares fell initially in after-hours trading on the release of its results, but they then rallied to 1% higher on news of the new Star Wars movies. Chief executive Bob Iger said: ""We remain optimistic about our future, in part because quality truly does matter."" The entertainment giant also plans to launch a sports-focused ESPN+ app in the spring, and a Disney streaming service in 2019. Mr Iger said those investments, which add to an existing Disney subscription service in Europe, were ""vital"" to the firm's future. ""Our goal here is to be a viable player in the direct-to-consumer space, a space that we all know is a very compelling space to be in,"" he said. He declined to address reports that the company had held talks with 21st Century Fox about acquiring parts of its business, but he did not rule out an acquisition. ""I don't think there's ever such a thing as having too much quality."" Disney is grappling with a challenge from online video, which has won viewers of traditional television and movies and is driving a shift away from cable television. In the fourth quarter of Disney's financial year, covering the three months to the end of September, profits dipped 1% to $1.7bn. Quarterly revenues fell 3% to $12.8bn as the impact of hurricanes, lower advertising revenue and a decline in cable subscriptions weighed on the results. Revenue in its movie division sank 21%, which Disney said was due to a tough comparison with last year, when a new Star Wars movie lifted results. Disney's parks and resorts business, which has steadied results in recent quarters, was the only division that reported year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter, rising 6%. But even that unit was affected by the hurricanes that struck the US earlier this year. Disney said that accounted for a roughly 3% decline in US attendance.

"The father's statement (left) was translated by undertaker Ahmad Hraichie A man whose son died when a car crashed into a classroom in Sydney has said he forgives the driver of the vehicle. The child was one of two eight-year-old boys who were killed inthe tragedy at a primary school on Tuesday. A 52-year-old woman, Maha al-Shennag, has been charged over the crash, which police believe was not intentional. The father's message of forgiveness in Arabic was translated by an undertaker as the pair sat in a hearse on their way to the boy's funeral. The video message, posted by Ahmad Hraichie, shows the boy's coffin in the background as he explains the father's view of the crash as an accident. ""They [the family] have forgiven. If anything, they want to sit with this lady and talk with her and tell her 'we forgive you',"" says Mr Hraichie in his translation. ""She is welcome to come and sit with the family to have a meal and to talk about how they can move forward."" Police investigate the crash in the Sydney suburb of Greenacre on Tuesday The father also calls for the community to stop any abuse aimed at the driver and the school. ""The father says they are making it bigger than it is. They are telling everyone out there. Forget her. It was an honest mistake. It could have happened to any of us,"" Mr Hraichie says. Of the message, Mr Hraichie says: ""This is the way a proper Muslim acts in a time of calamity and tribulation."" The crash at Banksia Road Public School in the suburb of Greenacre has rocked what local lawmaker Jihad Dib described as a ""very close-knit community"". Three girls were taken to hospital with injuries after the crash. Ms al-Shennag - also a parent at the school, according to Mr Dib - has been charged with dangerous driving occasioning death.

"The current HPV vaccine is given in two doses Women vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) - thought to cause about 99% of cervical cancers - may only need three smear tests in their lifetime, a new study suggests. Since 2008, the HPV vaccine has been offered to girls aged 11 to 13. Reported cases of HPV have fallen sharply since then. A team from Queen Mary University of London found that screenings at age 30, 40 and 55 would offer the same benefit to these young women as the current 12. Prof Peter Sasieni, the lead author of the study, said cutting the number of smear tests for vaccinated women would make sense and save money. ""These women are far less likely to develop cervical cancer so they don't need such stringent routine checking as those at a higher risk,"" he said. ""This decision would free up resources for where they are needed most. The change in the screening system is a unique opportunity to reassess how often women are invited for cervical screens during their lifetimes."" The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer and funded by Cancer Research UK, comes ahead of changes being planned to the screening programme in England for 2019 and similar adjustments in Scotland and Wales. At the moment, labs test for abnormalities in cells taken in a smear test but the new tests will check for the presence of HPV first and only check for abnormal cells if the virus is found. The study says that when the new HPV testing first comes in, unvaccinated women should only need seven screenings in their lifetime, instead of 12. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said it was ""great news"" for women. ""While we hope to see these improvements to the screening programme in the future, it's important that women continue to take up invitations for cervical screening."" Sarah Farr with her daughter Maisie, who is seven Sarah Farr, 34, from Barrow in Cumbria, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in November 2016. Her cancer was picked up early through a screening - she had surgery to remove the cancer and didn't need any further treatment. She is very glad her seven-year-old daughter Maisie will be able to get innoculated and experience fewer screenings. ""Cervical screening can be quite an uncomfortable experience, but I'm forever grateful that the test spotted my cancer early. ""It would be great if Maisie doesn't have to have to go for screening as often as I did, because of the HPV jab and the new screening test."" Cervical cancer is one of the most deadly but most preventable forms of cancer in women It is the most common cancer in women under 35 Around 3,000 cases are diagnosed every year in the UK and it causes 900 deaths Public Health England says almost all the deaths are of older women who did not benefit from the HPV vaccination programme Currently 85% of eligible girls are immunised and HPV vaccine rates in England are among the world's highest The vaccine could save several hundred lives every year and also provide protection against other cancers and genital warts Women aged 25 to 64 are automatically invited for cervical screening, which detects abnormal cell changes in the cervix Source: Public Health England Testing for HPV first will be rolled out into the English cervical screening programme over the next two years. A new HPV vaccine is also expected to be introduced at some point from 2019. It should have a 90% success rate - up from 70% for the current vaccine. With this new vaccine, the researchers believe vaccinated women will only need two smear tests in their lifetime. Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said while it is positive to see a potential reduction in screenings needed, focus must continue on increasing the uptake of the vaccination and screening programmes to ensure more women are able to benefit from these advances. ""We would urge the government to use any savings made as a result of reduced screening intervals to fund a national cervical screening awareness campaign. ""If we do not reverse falling screening attendance we will simply be faced with more lives lost to the disease which could have been prevented."" In July, immunisation experts decided there was little evidence to justify giving boys the HPV vaccine because high uptake among girls would reduce everyone's risk of HPV infection - butcritics said the decision was concerning. The HPV vaccine works best if girls get it before they come into contact with HPV - in other words, before they become sexually active. That is why getting the vaccine during the teenage years is recommended. However, girls who have already had sex should still have the vaccine if they are in the relevant age group. Girls can have the HPV vaccination on the NHS up to their 18th birthday but they will need three doses, rather than the normal two, in order to be fully protected if they are over 15. If you are not eligible for the vaccine, experts say the best protection against cervical cancer is to continue going for regular cervical screenings. In the UK, women are invited for screening between the ages of 25 and 64, every few years.

"The gap in pay between men and women will take 100 years to close, a campaign group has warned. Campaigners highlight 10 November as the point in 2017 when a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts. But in some parts of the UK, the gender pay gap is so wide, it is as though women work unpaid from September. Vivienne Hayes, of the Women's Resource Centre, said progress had moved at a ""snail's pace"". Campaign group the Fawcett Society said that progress in closing the pay gap has ""stalled"". If the mean average pay gap for full time workers of 14.1% closes at the rate it has over the last five years, it won't reach 0% until 2117, it said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.Can't see the map?Click here,external The government wants large firms to disclose their pay gap, but will not force them to comply. Ms Hayes, chief executive of charity the Women's Resource Centre, said: ""We are here again, year after year lamenting the seemingly impervious issue of equal pay for men and women. ""Even though we have had a law since 1970 outlawing the practice of sex discrimination in pay, our progress is probably not even at a snail's pace."" There are different ways of calculating the pay gap. For example, for full time workers. the gap based on median hourly earnings has narrowed to its smallest for 20 years, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external, but was still 9.1% in 2017. Taking into account all workers, both full and part time, the median average gap has risen slightly from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% this year. In 183 out of 206 local authority areas, men in full time jobs earn more on average than women, but the gap varies from place to place. The top 10 includes the City of London and Tower Hamlets, which contains the financial area Canary Wharf. However, it is not a simple case of the gap being highest in the areas with the most lucrative jobs. Blaenau Gwent in Wales has the highest percentage gap between male and female full-time workers, with the average man on Â£14.07 an hour and average woman on Â£9.54, a difference of 32%. That is equivalent to women not being paid from 4 September. Knowsley in Merseyside, one of the most deprived areas of England, also appears in the top 10. Why is Essex best for top pay? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Does your job pay less than five years ago? Paid less than your colleagues?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Roger Smith from the Office for National Statistics said women tend to earn more in areas with a higher rate of people working in the public sector while the age of the workforce also played a part. The Fawcett Society said when higher earning jobs, more commonly held by men, are given more weight the average would mean effectively women stopped being paid from 10 November. Jemima Olchawski, of the society, said: ""One of the biggest gaps is in finance, which is why you'll see the City of London and Tower Hamlets high up. ""There will also be issues around care. Women still make up the vast majority of carers. So we need to see more support for fathers to take time out to be with their children or care for relatives."" Lawyer Linda Wong says financial penalties are needed when firms do not disclose their pay gap Linda Wong, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, said: ""The pay gap will persist unless there is commitment and consistency across the board."" The firm has been representing 17,000 former and current employees of Asda and 1,000 Sainsbury's workers in claims for equal pay. An employment tribunal found in 2016 that the Asda women, who mainly worked at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men working in warehouses. Lawyers said the difference in pay was between Â£1 and Â£3 an hour. Asda strongly disputed the claims and is appealing. It said the demands of the jobs were different. ""Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors,"" a spokeswoman said. Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars The gender pay gap at the BBC has also been exposed with men found to beearning an average of 9.3%more than women. However, Director General Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"" where the gap is higher. Female presenters have demanded ""real change"" by the end of 2017 after it was revealed two-thirds of stars on more than Â£150,000 a year were men. Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics If official figures say the gap is 9% and campaigners say it's 14%, is someone using a dodgy number? Not necessarily. Both figures come from theOffice for National Statistics,external. They use different averages. The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number. The 14% figure uses the mean average. The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values. If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much. The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society. Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December. There were 23 areas of the UK where women's average pay was greater than men's. This included Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, which have a high proportion of people out of work due to unemployment, sickness, disability or caring duties. However, they also included areas like Bexley, Havering and Sutton, which have low levels of unemployment. Across the UK, the average full-time male chief executive or senior official earns Â£48.53 an hour, or Â£93,960 a year. A woman in a similar role earns an average of Â£36.54 an hour, or Â£70,000 a year. The UK ranks 20th out of 144 countries around the world for closing the gender pay gap, but no country has absolute equality. In Iceland, which is ranked the best by the World Economic Forum, women walked out of their workplaces at 14:38 on 24 October 2016 in protest at the gap. According to unions, this was the time of day that women began working unpaid relative to men. Minister of state for apprenticeships, skills and women Anne Milton said the government had introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018. ""By shining a light on where there are gaps, they can take action to address it,"" she saidâ. ""There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."" Female workers won an equal pay claim against Birmingham City Council Women who worked for decades for Birmingham City Council celebrated when they were told they had won their battle for equal pay, but were angry it had ever had to go to court. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled the council would have to pay claims brought by former employees who earned less than male counterparts. The following year the council agreed to settle 11,000 claims. Pam Saunders spent almost 30 years with the authority and worked as a mobile home care assistant, helping people to wash, do their shopping and housework. She told the BBC in 2012: ""At the end of the day we did work hard for them. We really, really did and so why shouldn't they have paid us the right amount in the beginning?"" The BBC England Data Unit used the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings published by the Office for National Statistics and analysed the full time hourly median earnings, excluding overtime, for male and female workers in each local authority area to get the percentage gap between their earnings. We then calculated the dates on which the average female worker in each area effectively stops being paid, relative to male workers, because of the gap in their earnings.

"Universities are going to be given tougher guidance on their advertising claims Universities are going to face a crackdown on how they advertise and market courses to attract students. With hundreds of thousands of young people in the process of applying, universities are going to be warned by the advertising watchdog that they need to prove the accuracy of their claims. It is expected that universities will be told not to mislead or exaggerate in language used in adverts for students. They will scrutinise claims such as being in the ""top 1%"". The University of Reading has already had to take down its claim to be the top 1% of the world's universities, because it could not be objectively substantiated. Next week the Advertising Standards Authority is expected to identify up to six more universities which have breached the advertising code - along with issuing tougher guidelines on what is permissible language in marketing. The University of Reading had to stop saying it was in the top 1% in the world It has emerged that two universities have already agreed to clarify advertising. The watchdog says the University of Bedfordshire faced a complaint about claiming to have ""gold standard"" teaching quality - when the university held a silver award in the new teaching excellence ratings. Liverpool John Moores University was challenged over being more specific about its claim to be ""university of the year"". It won the title in this year's ""Educate North Awards"". Universities are competing for students and their fee income and have been putting increasing efforts into how they appeal to potential applicants, selling  marketing information on websites and on open days. There has been a proliferation of league tables and rankings which are used to base claims about ""world class"" status for universities or individual degree courses. The advertising watchdog has been considering whether university claims are justified by any ""objective substantiation"" - and without ""adequate substantiation"", can rule them to be ""misleading"". If advertisers persistently refuse to accept rulings from the watchdog, they can be referred to trading standards officers, who could impose fines. But the advertising watchdog says advertisers are more likely to comply rather than face ""bad publicity"". The University of Reading was told in the summer that it could be ""materially misleading"" to market itself as being in the top 1% of all world universities - a claim made by several other UK universities. The claim had been based on Reading's ranking in a number of international league tables - but without a clear agreement over how many universities there are in the world, such a claim was deemed as unacceptable. The university agreed to remove the claim and the complaint was ""informally resolved"" without a formal investigation or ruling. But it is understood that the issue was then raised with wider university representative groups - because many universities make such specific claims about their international reputations.

"Mr Bercow has previously called for ""zero tolerance"" of sexual harassment in Parliament Fewer people will be caught up in the Westminster sex scandal than were exposed in the expenses row, Commons Speaker John Bercow has predicted. Mr Bercow said he did not expect numbers ""anything like"" those found to be claiming fraudulently in 2009. He added this would ""probably limit the damage"" but did not mean the current revelations were ""insignificant"". His comments came as parliamentary leaders agreed a grievance procedure for handling allegations of misconduct. A number of MPs and officials from different parties are being investigated over their behaviour. Labour activist Bex Bailey has said she was raped at a party eventand discouraged from reporting the 2011 incident by a party official. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was the first to resign over allegations against him.He stepped downafter journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer told how a senior politician - named by others as Sir Michael - repeatedly touched her knee until she explained to him she would punch him in the face if he did it again. Meanwhile Labour MPs, Kelvin Hopkins and Clive Lewis, have also faced accusations but have issued firm denials. Are you being sexually harassed at work? When does flirting become sexual harassment? Mr Bercow, who has previously called for zero tolerance of sexual harassment in Parliament, said he did not think the ""sheer numbers"" would be as great and that ""might and probably will limit, not remove, not render insignificant, but limit the damage"". At an event at Queen Mary University in London, he said: ""I think that we will get to grips with it by acting speedily and effectively, both to ensure that people who are suspected of wrongdoing are investigated and, in particular, to ensure that a complaints mechanism is established which is characterised above all by independence."" He added: ""I am not diminishing the significance of this. It is a real and big challenge, but I think almost learning from past scandals will help us react to and deal with it better.""

"The latest John Lewis campaign focuses on a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster Brands will be spending a record Â£6bn on Christmas advertising in 2017, according to an industry body forecast. The Advertising Association says it is being driven by intense market competition, especially within the retail sector, and the rise of big-budget campaigns. It believes spending on ads has jumped nearly 40% in just seven years. The figures come as campaigns by major retailers such as John Lewis, M&S and Asda get under way. ""There have been so many blockbuster campaigns over the last 10 years,"" says Karen Fraser, director of Credos, a think tank which compiled the forecast with the Advertising Association. John Lewis' Christmas ads have become particularly anticipated by the public and advertisers in recent years. A recurring theme in John Lewis adverts has been to take out branding and centre on stories to grab people's attention. Their latest campaign - launched this week - focuses on the tale of a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster living under his bed. Rival Marks and Spencer has launched an advert featuring Paddington Bear stumbling across a burglar he mistakes for Father Christmas. Marks and Spencer's ad has Paddington handing out a marmalade sandwich Meanwhile, Asda's ad follows a girl and her grandfather visiting a festive food factory. Among a survey of 1,000 Brits interviewed on behalf of the Advertising Association, nearly half said they had been moved to tears by Christmas ads they'd seen. One in six also said they have changed plans to watch the premiere of their favourite Christmas ad. ""It's just upped the ante,"" adds Karen Fraser, ""and so many brands and retailers are looking to compete in that market but it means that everyone needs to work harder to get people's attention."" Asda's advert features an imaginary creative workshop - the Imaginarium Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that purchasing from retailers - traditionally the biggest investor in Christmas advertising - has increased. Prices of consumer goods have also undergone their highest year-on-year growth since March 2012 at 3.3%, meaning shops are facing an uphill struggle to attract consumers as real wages fall. ""A lot of businesses don't have much of an option other than to go for it,"" says Craig Mawdsley, chief strategy officer at advertising agency AMVBBDO. ""Some brands get to grow, but most are trying to offset the growth of others"". Christmas monster advert divides opinion Should we all impose a one-gift rule at Christmas?

"The future operation of the Irish border is one of the most sensitive Brexit issues There were ""frank discussions"" about the Irish border in the latest round of Brexit talks, David Davis has said. The Brexit Secretary was speaking in Brussels after a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Davis said any solution for the border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU tabled a paper which suggested Northern Ireland will have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border is to be avoided. 'Difficult to see' NI in single market The hardest border Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The paper hinted that Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there are to be no checks at the border. That is something which the Conservatives and DUP have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said the UK has two weeks to clarify what it will pay the EU if progress is to be made in Brexit talks. Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring Brexit does not undermine the Good Friday agreement. Neither want Brexit to lead to the emergence of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Let me be clear, we cannot have anything resulting in a new border being set up with in the UK,"" said Mr Davis after the sixth round of UK-EU talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's ""divorce bill"". ""We remain firmly committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure. ""We respect the EU desires, but they cannot come at the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."" Mr Davis said the EU and UK teams had drafted joint positions on the common travel area, as well as joint principles and commitments for the second phase of talks. The EU leaked paper stops short of saying a hard border can only be avoided by the UK or Northern Ireland staying in the single market or customs union. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was attending the British-Irish Council in Jersey However, it brings the commission closer to the European Parliament position which ""presumes"" that the UK or Northern Ireland will have to stay in the internal market and customs union. It is also the clearest indication that the commission has accepted the Irish position on Brexit and the border issue. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the only way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit is for the whole of the UK, or Northern Ireland, to follow the rules of the customs union and single market. Speaking at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Jersey, Mr Varadkar said his proposal would not mean the UK or Northern Ireland had to be members of the customs union and single market, but ""it would mean continuing to apply the rules"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has given the UK two weeks to clarify what it will pay to leave the EU DUP Parliamentary leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds rejected the suggestion that a hard border can only be avoided if the UK or Northern Ireland continue to abide by the rules of the single market and customs union after Brexit. He said the paper shows the EU is unwilling to engage in negotiations on the border issue in a ""meaningful fashion"". ""Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit,"" he said. ""Brussels must realise this and accept that progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics."" The DUP's Nigel Dodds said Brussels must accept progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said talk of individual countries vetoing a move to the next stage of Brexit negotiations is ""unhelpful"", but progress still had to be made on the border issue. ""There is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two,"" he told Irish state broadcaster, RTE. This video can not be played Bertie Ahern tells BBC Newsnight a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process Former Irish Taoiseach and Good Friday Agreement signatory Bertie Ahern told BBC Newsnight that a hard border would be a ""huge setback"" for the peace process and that a physical border across the island of Ireland would give a ""huge incentive"" to those that want to cause mischief.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told the UK ""time is pressing"" to get a deal on a divorce bill, as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels. Mr Barnier said ""the moment for real clarity"" from the UK was approaching. EU sources have told the BBC the UK has only two weeks left to make progress on so-called withdrawal issues. A major stumbling block remains the amount the UK will pay as it leaves, as well as the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and UK citizens in the EU. Without agreement in these areas, and the Northern Ireland border, EU leaders are unlikely to vote at their December summit to widen talks to include trade and transition deals as the UK wants, sources say. Brexit is 'getting dramatic', says EU PM faces reshuffle after Priti Patel quits Mr Barnier, who is in Rome to make a speech to Italian politicians, tweeted ""it's high time to clarify the essential principles"" of an exit deal with the UK. He will meet UK Brexit Secretary David Davis for a sixth round of negotiations on Friday, with talks being conducted by their officials on Thursday. It comes as European leaders are reportedly concerned about the instability of the UK government, as Theresa May lost a second cabinet minister in seven days. According to The Times, European Union leaders are preparing for the possible ""fall of Theresa May before the new year"" and either ""a change of leadership or elections leading to a Labour victory"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""a bit rich"" for EU leaders to suggest Mrs May's position was precarious, at a time when the Netherlands and Germany faced difficulties forming governments, there was ""chaos"" in Italy and arrests of Catalonian separatists in Spain. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government's lack of a Parliamentary majority meant it would be ""a bit bumpy at times"" but Mrs May's position was secure. ""I think Theresa May is the one person that can actually still unite the cabinet, unite the party, and make sure that whilst we are leaving the European Union, the party itself stays at ease with her domestic agenda,"" he said. The UK government has, meanwhile,published updated proposals,externalon how the rights of EU citizens in the UK will be protected, as it claimed ""real progress"" had been made in this area. EU citizens would be granted a statutory right of appeal if their application to stay in the UK after Brexit is rejected - and the cost of applying for settled status would be kept to ""no more than that of a British passport"". But the UK proposal was criticised by the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who said he wanted the application to be cost-free and near-unconditional. ""We don't recognise reports suggesting that a deal on citizens' rights is almost finalised. There are still major issues that have to be resolved,"" said Mr Verhofstadt on Wednesday. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019 after a referendum in which 51.9% of people voted in favour of Brexit. The two sides have said they are in favour of a transitional phase lasting around two years to smooth the way to relations with the UK outside the EU, but they are also doing preparatory work in case no agreement is reached and the UK leaves without any deal in place.

"This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt at Downing Street Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to the cabinet as the new International Development Secretary, following the resignation of Priti Patel. Like Ms Patel, Ms Mordaunt was among Conservatives who backed Leave during the EU Referendum campaign. Ms Mordaunt, 44, said she was ""delighted"" to take on the role, as she visited her new department. Ms Patel quit on Wednesday, admitting unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials had ""lacked transparency"". It was the second cabinet resignation in a week. Last week Gavin Williamson replaced Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary, after he quit saying his conduct had ""fallen short"" of the required standards after allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. Who is Penny Mordaunt? May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Priti Patel quits cabinet over Israel meetings row Gavin Williamson replaces Michael Fallon Ms Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, is a Royal Navy reservist and was appointed as the first female minister for the Armed Forces in 2015. It had been thought she was in the running to replace Sir Michael last week. Speaking at the Department for International Development, Ms Mordaunt said: ""I'm delighted to have been appointed by the prime minister to be the new secretary of state for International Development. ""I'm looking forward to working with the team here to continue building a safer, more secure, more prosperous world for us all and really giving the British public pride in what we do."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are good reasons why Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to the Department for International Development. She has worked in humanitarian aid, she has been a minister in two different departments, former colleagues rate her abilities and she was tipped last week to be elevated to running the Ministry of Defence. But there is a lot more to her than meets the eye, and a lot more that is interesting about her than going on TV in a swimsuit. She also has a different political qualification - she was prominent campaigning Brexiteer. Read more from Laura First elected to the Commons in 2010 she had been minister for disabled people in the Department for Work and Pensions until her promotion. She is also known for appearing on the reality TV programme Splash! in 2014. BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said she thought Ms Mordaunt would be a popular appointment within the party. She said it would keep the balance within the cabinet when it came to Brexit - in terms of the numbers of ministers who supported Leave or Remain during the referendum - as well as preserving the gender balance, an issue which Theresa May was concerned about. As International Development Secretary, Ms Mordaunt will be in charge of the UK's Â£13bn foreign aid budget. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt relives her moment diving in to a swimming pool on TV and admits ""it hurt a bit"" as she hit the water Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told the BBC: ""I think it's a good appointment. Penny is somebody who has a lot of experience, she has worked in an international department before - as armed forces minister, I have no doubt she will do an excellent job."" Aid charities also welcomed the appointment. Referring to Ms Mordaunt's student work in Romanian orphanages, director of anti-poverty campaign One UK, Romilly Greenhill, said she was ""well suited for her new role"" while Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring hoped Ms Mordaunt would be ""a champion for Britain ensuring that aid is spent where it is most needed, helping the world's poorest people"". Her Labour shadow Kate Osamor congratulated Ms Mordaunt on her appointment and said she ""faces an immediate challenge of restoring integrity to British international development policy after the actions of Priti Patel"". This video can not be played What went wrong for Priti Patel? The BBC's James Landale explains She added: ""That means she must unequivocally commit to the spirit, as well as the letter, of Britain's pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on international development, and face down those in her party who want to merge DFID into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office."" Ms Patel's difficulties began last week, when the BBC revealed she had arranged a number of  meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday to Israel in August, without telling Downing Street or the Foreign Office. It later emerged that after Ms Patel's visit to Israel, she asked her officials to look into whether Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. In other appointments on Thursday, Sarah Newton has been made a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions while Victoria Atkins has become a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office.

"Theresa May has outlined plans to set the UK's departure date and time from the EU in law, warning she will not ""tolerate"" any attempt to block Brexit. She said the EU Withdrawal Bill would be amended to formally commit to Brexit at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March 2019. The bill will be scrutinised by MPs next week - but the PM warned against attempts to stop it or slow it down. Mrs May waswriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalas a fresh round of Brexit negotiations are due to begin later. The UK is due to leave the European Union after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit. Gordon Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' Barnier: 'Time is pressing' in Brexit talks NI must 'abide by EU rules' to avoid hard border Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit ""on the front page"" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through. ""Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,"" she wrote. ""It will be there in black and white on the front page of this historic piece of legislation: the United Kingdom will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 at 11pm GMT."" The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage. Mrs May said most people wanted politicians to ""come together"" to negotiate a good Brexit deal, adding that MPs ""on all sides"" should help scrutinise the bill. She said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process. Post-Brexit trade proposals published Corbyn: Agree transition deal now Rudd: Brexit without deal 'unthinkable' ""We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this Bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union."" MPs have previously been told there have been 300 amendments and 54 new clauses proposed. David Davis is due to take part in a fresh round of Brexit negotiations The PM said the ""historic"" bill was ""fundamental to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit"" and would give ""the greatest possible clarity and certainty for all businesses and families across the country"". Labour MP and remain campaigner, Chuka Umunna, said many experts believed the March 2019 leaving date did not give much time for negotiations. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Lord Bridges said he could not see the government being able to negotiate the transition arrangement, like the bridge to us leaving, and the divorce bill, by 2019.  So we may actually need more time."" Lord Kerr, the former diplomat who helped draft Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the mechanism the UK has used to exit the EU - said putting the Brexit date on the bill did not mean the withdrawal process was irreversible.

"Theresa May has outlined plans to set the UK's departure date and time from the EU in law, warning she will not ""tolerate"" any attempt to block Brexit. She said the EU Withdrawal Bill would be amended to formally commit to Brexit at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March 2019. The bill will be scrutinised by MPs next week - but the PM warned against attempts to stop it or slow it down. Mrs May waswriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalas a fresh round of Brexit negotiations are due to begin later. The UK is due to leave the European Union after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit. Gordon Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' Barnier: 'Time is pressing' in Brexit talks NI must 'abide by EU rules' to avoid hard border Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit ""on the front page"" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through. ""Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,"" she wrote. ""It will be there in black and white on the front page of this historic piece of legislation: the United Kingdom will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 at 11pm GMT."" The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage. Mrs May said most people wanted politicians to ""come together"" to negotiate a good Brexit deal, adding that MPs ""on all sides"" should help scrutinise the bill. She said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process. Post-Brexit trade proposals published Corbyn: Agree transition deal now Rudd: Brexit without deal 'unthinkable' ""We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this Bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union."" MPs have previously been told there have been 300 amendments and 54 new clauses proposed. David Davis is due to take part in a fresh round of Brexit negotiations The PM said the ""historic"" bill was ""fundamental to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit"" and would give ""the greatest possible clarity and certainty for all businesses and families across the country"". Labour MP and remain campaigner, Chuka Umunna, said many experts believed the March 2019 leaving date did not give much time for negotiations. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Lord Bridges said he could not see the government being able to negotiate the transition arrangement, like the bridge to us leaving, and the divorce bill, by 2019.  So we may actually need more time."" Lord Kerr, the former diplomat who helped draft Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the mechanism the UK has used to exit the EU - said putting the Brexit date on the bill did not mean the withdrawal process was irreversible. The cross-bench peer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that decisions such as these were being made in Westminster, and ""had nothing to do with the treaty, and they have nothing to do with the views of our partners in Brussels"".

"The latest John Lewis campaign focuses on a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster Brands will be spending a record Â£6bn on Christmas advertising in 2017, according to an industry body forecast. The Advertising Association says it is being driven by intense market competition, especially within the retail sector, and the rise of big-budget campaigns. It believes spending on ads has jumped nearly 40% in just seven years. The figures come as campaigns by major retailers such as John Lewis, M&S and Asda get under way. ""There have been so many blockbuster campaigns over the last 10 years,"" says Karen Fraser, director of Credos, a think tank which compiled the forecast with the Advertising Association. John Lewis' Christmas ads have become particularly anticipated by the public and advertisers in recent years. A recurring theme in John Lewis adverts has been to take out branding and centre on stories to grab people's attention. Their latest campaign - launched this week - focuses on the tale of a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster living under his bed. Rival Marks and Spencer has launched an advert featuring Paddington Bear stumbling across a burglar he mistakes for Father Christmas. Marks and Spencer's ad has Paddington handing out a marmalade sandwich Meanwhile, Asda's ad follows a girl and her grandfather visiting a festive food factory. Among a survey of 1,000 Brits interviewed on behalf of the Advertising Association, nearly half said they had been moved to tears by Christmas ads they'd seen. One in six also said they have changed plans to watch the premiere of their favourite Christmas ad. ""It's just upped the ante,"" adds Karen Fraser, ""and so many brands and retailers are looking to compete in that market but it means that everyone needs to work harder to get people's attention."" Asda's advert features an imaginary creative workshop - the Imaginarium Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that purchasing from retailers - traditionally the biggest investor in Christmas advertising - has increased. Prices of consumer goods have also undergone their highest year-on-year growth since March 2012 at 3.3%, meaning shops are facing an uphill struggle to attract consumers as real wages fall. ""A lot of businesses don't have much of an option other than to go for it,"" says Craig Mawdsley, chief strategy officer at advertising agency AMVBBDO.

"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) and Emmanuel Macron met in Riyadh on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron has paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia amid an escalating crisis between the kingdom and Lebanon. His trip comes days after Lebanese PM Saad Hariri resigned while in Riyadh, saying he feared for his life. Foes Saudi Arabia and Iran have accused each other of fuelling instability in Lebanon and the wider region. Mr Macron and Saudi officials also discussed the crisis in Yemen, where Riyadh is leading a war against rebels. France has historical ties with Lebanon, as it was given the mandate to run the country before Lebanese independence during World War Two. Lebanon caught in crosshairs of Saudi-Iran tension Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah The French president was in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to open the Louvre Abu Dhabi, a spin-off of the famous Paris art museum. Ahead of his two-hour visit to Riyadh, Mr Macron said all Lebanese officials should live freely, ""which means having a very demanding stance on those who could threaten any leader"". No details of the alleged plot against Mr Hariri have been made public. Uncertainty surrounds Mr Hariri's circumstances, amid rumours he was being held in Riyadh. Mr Macron said on Thursday he had had informal contact with Mr Hariri, without giving details, while France's foreign minister said France believed Mr Hariri was able to move freely. Mr Hariri's resignation has created deep uncertainty in Lebanon Mr Hariri said in a TV broadcast on Saturday that he was stepping downbecause of the unspecified threat to his life. In the video statement, Mr Hariri also attacked Hezbollah, which is politically and militarily powerful in Lebanon, and Iran. There are fears Lebanon could become embroiled in a wider regional confrontation between major Sunni power Saudi Arabia and Shia-dominated Iran. Mr Macron is a keen supporter of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, which both the Saudis and the Trump administration have heavily criticised. Before going to Saudi Arabia, Mr Macron said that he had heard ""very harsh opinions"" on Iran from Saudi Arabia, which did not match his own view. ""It is important to speak with everyone,"" he added. But an official communiquÃ© from his office following the visit did not say Iran was among the matters discussed,French newspaper Le Monde reported,external. Tensions between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Lebanon have soared since Mr Hariri announced his resignation. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies told their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. It came afterRiyadh accused Iran of ""direct military aggression"", saying it supplied a missile which it says was fired by Hezbollah at Riyadh from Yemen on Saturday. Iran has dismissed the Saudi allegations as ""false and dangerous"".

"This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said he had ""no alternative"" but to sack Carl Sargeant First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he had no alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant following allegations about his conduct. Mr Sargeant's body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was dismissed as communities minister and suspended from the Welsh Labour party. It is understood he took his own life but Mr Jones said he had acted ""by the book"" over the matter. He said he would try to provide answers which Mr Sargeant's family deserved. There has beencriticism of the way Mr Sargeant was treatedand his family has called for an independent inquiry. Ex-Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also want an inquiry, which Mr Jones suggested could take place in future. Claims about inappropriate behaviour were made to the first minister's office last week and following Friday's sacking, the Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name even though he said he did not know the details of the allegations. An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will be opened and adjourned on Monday. As it happened: Jones' statement over Sargeant death 'Carl Sargeant not given natural justice' - family Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Minister removed over conduct claims Mr Jones met Labour AMs on Thursday to explain how he handled the conduct allegations against Mr Sargeant. Mr Jones then made a statement from Welsh Government headquarters in Cardiff on Thursday afternoon. He called the situation ""the darkest days"" any of those at the assembly could remember, but said they were the ""darkest of all for the family"". A relentless drip-drip of disinformation had a strain on Mr Sargeant and others, Leighton Andrews says Despite speculation Mr Jones could have resigned on Thursday, the speech made no reference to his own political future. Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr Sargeant's death, he said: ""There are a lot of inaccuracies in the press and many of you have questions to ask about what happened last week."" He said precise details ""will need to be properly disclosed"" at the inquest. ""I and my team will of course be cooperating fully with any questions that are raised there,"" he said. ""The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn't possible through the inquest then I will endeavour to make that happen through other means. ""I welcome any scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently."" Paying tribute to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Carl was a true force of nature - he drove through more legislation than any other minister. Not just through force of argument, but through force of personality."" When Carwyn Jones finally appeared in front of the cameras today to deliver a statement on the death of Carl Sargeant and the events that led up to it, there was an expectation that the first minister would attempt to answer at least some of the many questions that have been raised since the former secretary's death. Instead, while paying tribute to the man he described as a ""true force of nature"" he did little to answer the questions raised by Mr Sargeant's family and others. A reference to a possible independent inquiry seemed equivocal at best. The first minister's reference to ""inaccuracies in the press"" again raises more questions than answers. If reports are inaccurate - why not correct them and why refuse to answer questions from journalists who are trying their best to report the situation accurately? Carwyn Jones is human, of course, and I have no doubt that his grief and shock is genuine. That may explain why a statement which would have been perfectly apt in the hours following Mr Sargeant's death seems insufficient and vague when delivered two and half days later. Following the news conference, opponents rounded on Mr Jones. Mr Davies said the episode has ""significantly undermined public confidence in the first minister"", while Ms Wood said the statement ""was not adequate"". UKIP Wales said it would call for a motion of no confidence in the first minister. And Mr Sargeant's lifelong friend and Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge, called for Mr Jones to resign saying he ""had not done the decent thing"". Mr Andrews said a number of people were expecting a ""definite commitment to an independent inquiry"" from Mr Jones' statement. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Andrews alleged Mr Sargeant had been the target of bullying in the Welsh Government. This video can not be played Leighton Andrews wants answers from the first minister Former public services minister Mr Andrews - claimed there was ""minor bullying"" and ""mind games"" during his time in government -  and said the atmosphere was ""toxic"" during the last assembly term. ""The undermining was of ministers, deputy ministers and special advisers,"" Mr Andrews said in a statement issued on Thursday. He said Mr Sargeant ""was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour. The relentless drip-drip of disinformation - and worse - had a strain on his and others' mental health."" The ex-Rhondda AM said he had raised one particular issue with Mr Jones, of which he had direct evidence, but claimed due process was not followed. The Welsh Government has declined to respond to Mr Andrews' claims.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Sean Parker shares worries about social media âGod only knows what itâs doing to our childrenâs brains.â A view on social media shared not by some uninformed luddite, but by one of the people responsible for building Facebook into the social media titan it is today. Sean Parker, Facebookâs founding president, unloaded his worries and criticisms of the network, saying he had no idea what he was doing at the time of its creation. Speaking on stage to Mike Allen from Axios,external, Mr Parker said: ""The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?â"" âThat means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. ""And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you... more likes and comments.â Mr Parker first rose to tech prominence as the creator of pioneering file-sharing service Napster. In the Facebook story, it was Mr Parker who steered the firm into Silicon Valley and put Mark Zuckerbergâs idea in front of big name investors. Those early days were reimagined in the film the Social Network. Mr Parker was played by Justin Timberlake. ""When Facebook was getting going,â Mr Parker said on Wednesday, ""I had these people who would come up to me and they would say, 'I'm not on social media.â ""And I would say, 'OK. You know, you will be.ââ He then added: ""I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or two billion people and, it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. ""It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains."" As for his own habits, Mr Parker said he no longer used social media as it was âtoo much of a time sinkâ. However, he said he still had an account on Facebook. ""If Mark hears this heâs probably going to suspend my account,â he joked. Facebook did not respond to the BBC's request for reaction to the comments. âI use these platforms, I just donât let these platforms use me,â Mr Parker concluded. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Humans to vet Facebook revenge porn pics Facebook's fake news experiment backfires I lost my job over a Facebook post Senators berate tech firms on Russia Russia posts 'reached 126m Facebook users' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Donald Trump said he would put ""America first"" at the Apec summit US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have set out starkly different visions for the future of global trade in speeches at a summit in Vietnam. In a defiant address, Mr Trump told the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting that the US would no longer tolerate ""chronic trade abuses"". In contrast, President Xi said globalisation was irreversible. Mr Trump is currently on a five-nation Asia tour, with China one of his stops. Apec brings together 21 economies from the Pacific region - the equivalent of about 60% of the world's GDP. Since taking office, President Trump has pursued his ""America First"" agenda and pulled the US out of the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership -  a major trade deal with 12 Apec nations - arguing it would hurt US economic interests. ""Indo-Pacific"" - Trump's latest catchphrase Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on? The hidden messages in Trump's Asian menu In a speech in the Vietnamese port city of Da Nang on Friday, President Trump railed against the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade laws, and said it ""cannot function properly"" if all members do not respect the rules. He complained about trade imbalances, saying the US had lowered market barriers and ended tariffs while other countries had not reciprocated. ""Such practices hurt many people in our country,"" he said, adding that free trade had cost millions of American jobs. But he did not lay the blame on Apec countries, and instead accused earlier US administrations of not acting earlier to reverse the trend. He said America would make bilateral agreements with ""any Indo-Pacific partner here who abides by fair reciprocal trade"", but only ""on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit"". Xi Jinping is promoting China as the champion of free trade Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to the region as ""Indo-Pacific"", a term used to define America's new geopolitical view of Asia. Trump says trade deficit not China's fault The US president had travelled to Da Nang from Beijing, where he had also discussed America's huge trade imbalance with China. There too,he said he did not blame the country for ""taking advantage"". Mr Trump also met Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit. The two shook hands and exchanged a few words, Russian news agencies reported. Mr Trump and Mr Putin shook hands briefly Speaking minutes after his American counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping took to the podium to espouse his country's credentials as the new champion of world trade. Globalisation, he said, was an ""irreversible historical trend"" but the philosophy behind free trade needed to be repurposed to be ""more open, more balanced, more equitable and more beneficial to all"". In contrast to President Trump, the Chinese leader defended multilateral trade deals, which he said helped poorer nations to benefit. ""We should support the multilateral trading regime and practise open regionalism to allow developing members to benefit more from international trade and investment."" By Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent President Trump was clear - he wants bilateral trade deals and large, multilateral arrangements don't work for him. This was a speech saying that America is open for business, but on America's terms. Contrast that with China's Xi Jinping, who spoke about the digital economy, quantum science, artificial intelligence - presenting a vision of the future that is connected, and comprehensive. Increasingly whenever you see Mr Xi on the international stage he is the poster child for free trade and globalisation. Ironic, given that China itself has yet to become a fully free economy. The US was the architect of many of the multilateral and free trade agreements for Asia. Under its tutelage, many of these countries opened up and reformed - playing by America's rules. But under Donald Trump, that role has gone into reverse. Which has left China with a gaping hole to fill - and one it is only more than happy to take on. Read more from Karishma The total trade relationship between the US and China was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a nearly $310bn deficit. Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, thoughhe has since rowed back on such rhetoric. During the US president's visit on Thursday, China announced it would further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs. Deals worth $250bn (Â£190bn) were also announced, although it was unclear how much of that figure included past agreements or potential future deals. Trump vs Xi: The two men compared Before the Beijing talks, Mr Trump in Tokyo lashed out at Japan, saying it ""has been winning"" on trade in recent decades. Japan had a $69bn (Â£52.8bn) trade surplus with the US in 2016, according to the US Treasury department.

"The comments were inadvertently left on a family answerphone by officers who had been called out to deal with a ""vulnerable child"" Two police officers have been sacked after they left a message on a woman's answer machine saying they hoped her child ""would get raped"". The Avon and Somerset officers left the recording after being called to deal with a ""vulnerable child"", a misconduct hearing was told. PC Samuel Dexter and PC Hannah Mayo are heard laughing and saying they did not care what happened to the child. Both officers admitted gross misconduct and were dismissed without notice. The hearing on Tuesday at police headquarters was told the child had been reported missing before being found by PC Dexter and reunited with the family. But a short while later,according to the hearing outcome notice,external, the child's mother called the police again to report the child was ""causing problems at the family home"". En-route to the property, PC Dexter and PC Mayo phoned the mother for more information and inadvertently activated the answerphone. In the recorded message the officers can be heard laughing and saying they had ""no interest whatsoever"" in the child and both then said they hoped the child would ""get raped"". In his verdict at the hearing, Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the comments had ""broken the trust"" the child's family had in the police. He said: ""[The comments] go way beyond the boundaries that could be described as dark humour. ""I cannot accept the comments were a mistake, they were far more serious than that, and the people we serve will be appalled to hear that police officers spoke in such a way about a child."" Ch Insp Mark Edgington, of the professional standards department, said the officers had ""failed to treat the child and their family with respect"". ""Both officers used appalling and horrific language about a vulnerable missing child and their family,"" he said. ""There are no excuses for their behaviour and their actions are not reflective of our force or the officers and staff who work extremely hard every day to safeguard and protect vulnerable people."" Both officers have offered ""fulsome apologies"" to the child and their family.

"Louis CK's planned appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has also been cancelled US comedian Louis CK's movie premiere has been cancelled hours before the screening as five women levelled sexual misconduct allegations against him. Four of the accusers told the New York Times he had masturbated during interactions with them and a fifth said he had asked to do so. The BBC has contacted the Emmy-winning comic's manager for a comment. The distributor of his new film, I Love You, Daddy, said it was reviewing plans for its general release. Four comediennes - Dana Min Goodman, Julia Wolov, Rebecca Corry and Abby Schachner - and a fifth woman who spoke on condition of anonymity made allegations about the entertainerin Thursday's New York Times report.,external Ms Goodman and Ms Wolov said Louis CK stripped naked and masturbated after inviting them to his hotel room during the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002. Actresses Julia Wolov (L) and Dana Goodman in Hollywood in 2011 Ms Corry told the newspaper that the comic was a guest star on a TV pilot she was appearing on in 2005 when he asked if he could go to her dressing room so she could watch him perform a sex act on himself. She said she rebuked him and pointed out that he had a daughter and a pregnant wife. Ms Schachner said she called Louis CK in 2003 to invite him to one of her shows and was dumbfounded to realise during their phone conversation that he was masturbating. ""I felt very ashamed,"" she told the New York Times. A fifth woman, who did not want to be named, told the newspaper of alleged incidents involving the comic in the late 1990s while she was working in production on The Chris Rock Show. Louis CK, who was a writer and producer on the show, repeatedly asked her to watch him perform a sex act, she said. A question mark now hangs over the general release of the comedian's new film The accuser told the New York Times she went along with his requests even though she knew it was wrong. ""He abused his power,"" she said. The premiere of Louis CK's new movie in New York City on Thursday night was abruptly called off. I Love You, Daddy was written and directed by Louis CK, who also stars in the film as a father who tries to stop his 17-year-old daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) from having a relationship with a seedy 68-year-old film director (John Malkovich). Rebecca Corry said Louis CK asked if he could go to her dressing room so she could watch him perform a sex act The movie's distributor, the Orchard, has not confirmed that it will go ahead with its release date in cinemas on 17 November. ""In light of the allegations considering Louis CK references in today's New York Times, we are cancelling tonight's premiere of I Love You, Daddy,"" the Orchard said in a statement to industry publications. ""There is never a place for the behaviour detailed in these allegations. ""As a result, we are giving careful consideration to the timing and release of the film and continuing to review the situation."" ""I felt very ashamed,"" Abby Schachner told the New York Times Louis CK's planned appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has also been cancelled. On Thursday night, HBO announced it would purge Louis CK's past projects from its On Demand service. The cable TV network also said the comic would no longer participate in a charity comedy special, Night of Too Many Stars, later this month. In September at the Toronto film festival, where I Love You, Daddy, was shown, the New York Times said it had asked Louis CK about claims of sexual misconduct against him. The divorced father of two daughters dismissed the reports as ""rumours"". Louis CK joins a growing list of Hollywood figures including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner and James Toback who have been engulfed by such allegations. On Thursday, a Los Angeles County district attorney Jackie Lacey announced a task force of veteran sex crimes prosecutors to address ""the widespread allegations of sexual abuse in entertainment industry"".

"Those caught up in the anti-corruption drive are reportedly being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Saudi Arabia's attorney general says at least $100bn (Â£76bn) has been misused through systemic corruption and embezzlement in recent decades. Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said 201 people were being held for questioning,externalas part of a sweeping anti-corruption drive that began on Saturday night. He did not name any of them, but they reportedly include senior princes, ministers and influential businessmen. ""The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong,"" Sheikh Mojeb said. He also stressed that normal commercial activity in the kingdom had not been affected by the crackdown, and that only personal bank accounts had been frozen. Young Saudis weigh up crown prince's crackdown Ritzy Riyadh 'prison' for Saudi princes Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said investigations by the newly-formed supreme anti-corruption committee, which is headed by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, were ""progressing very quickly"". He announced that 208 individuals had been called in for questioning so far, and that seven of them had been released without charge. ""The potential scale of corrupt practices which have been uncovered is very large,"" the attorney general said. ""Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100bn has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades."" This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Sheikh Mojeb said the committee had a clear legal mandate to move on to the next phase of its investigation and that it had suspended the bank accounts of ""persons of interest"" on Tuesday. ""There has been a great deal of speculation around the world regarding the identities of the individuals concerned and the details of the charges against them,"" he added. ""In order to ensure that the individuals continue to enjoy the full legal rights afforded to them under Saudi law, we will not be revealing any more personal details at this time."" Among those reportedly detained are the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, a son of the late king who was also removed from his post as National Guard chief on Saturday; and his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent It is the Saudi weekend now and the country is still reeling from the monumental changes taking place. So far, so good, as far as the crown prince and his supporters are concerned. ""Phase One"", as the attorney-general calls it, is complete. Around 200 leading royal and business figures have been ""called in for questioning"" and there has been no visible resistance, no disaffected army hammering at the palace gates, no calls to arms on social media. Quite the opposite, in fact. Saudi Arabia's overwhelmingly young population has largely welcomed this clean-out of the kingdom's notoriously profligate elite. The more hardline Wahhabi religious clerics, still licking their wounds from the crown prince's recent announcement that the country needs to become more tolerant of other religions, will also be welcoming the purge. The questions on everyone's mind though, are how far will it go and who will be next? Purge demonstrates ruthlessness of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Others are said to include Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the television network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court; and Bakr Binladen, chairman of the Saudi Binladen Group. At least some of them are believed to be held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter. Paying guests were asked to vacate their rooms late on Saturday and the hotel's exterior gate has been shuttered since Sunday. On Tuesday, the US said it had urged the Saudi government to handle any prosecutions stemming from the probe in a ""fair and transparent"" manner. Human Rights Watch meanwhile called on Saudi officials to ""immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person's detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights"". The detentions follow a wave of other recent arrests of clerics, human rights activists and intellectuals, for which the authorities have not given specific reasons.
