"Northern Ireland's private sector output has dropped for the third month in a row, research from Ulster Bank suggests. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. May saw a fall in new business orders, staffing levels and overall output. Unlike in previous months, there was a fall in output of all four sectors of the economy. This is the first time that this has happened in six years. Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said: ""It's not just manufacturing that is weakening; all four sectors saw falling output for the first time in six years."" ""Construction firms have now reported falling orders for nine successive months and retailers have been reporting falling sales every month in 2019 to date."" Mr Ramsey said the global slowdown which had been impacting other economies was now clearly evident in Northern Ireland. ""Brexit stockpiling by manufacturing companies had been inflating the performance of local firms in recent months,"" he said. ""Now that the rapid phase of stockpiling activity has passed, the latest PMI (purchasing managers' index) data reflects the reality of current demand."" But the survey suggests expectations about the year ahead have improved, firms expect output to have risen in a year's time. Mr Ramsey said: ""Whilst firms expect challenges in the short-term - citing Brexit as one of the key factors - their expectations for the longer-term are marginally better.""

"Will anyone stop the Americans in France? Think of football and quite often Brazil will come to mind as an example of success. But not for the followers of the women's game. While in the men's version the South American country has an enviable collection of five Fifa World Cup titles and a legion of legendary players, it is the United States who are the powerhouse in the female landscape. Out of seven World Cups, the Americans have won three and finished as runner-ups once. They have also won four Olympic gold medals in six attempts. But Brazil's best result in the tournament is a solitary second place in 2007, though they do also have two Olympic silver medals. In fact, the only country with success on both fronts is Germany, with four men's and two women's titles. But what explains the reversal of scenarios in the US and Brazil? The US men's team's best result in a World Cup was third in 1930, but since then they have only reached the last eight once, in 2002, where they reached the quarter-finals - losing to eventual runners-up Germany. This was just one of the unusual results registered in a tournament where Turkey finished third and co-hosts South Korea fourth. But the women's game had a much different trajectory thanks to Title IX - a federal law that in 1972 established gender equality in the distribution of funding in high school and university sports, and which still forms the basis of professional sports in the US. By the time the first Women's World Cup took place in 1991, the US had a larger talent pool than anyone else. It took advantage of the fact that in many other countries women's football remained for years underfunded and with low participation rates. Brandi Chastain's iconic celebration in 1999 and the US' win on home soil at the 1999 World Cup helped to raise interest for football even more However, it was the 1999 world title that raised the game's profile. In that year, the US hosted and won the 1999 World Cup - the shirtless celebration of defender Brandi Chastain after scoring the winning penalty in the final against China is often referenced as one of the most iconic sporting moments by American media. Mia Hamm - who topped the all-time international scoring list in 1999, a month prior to the World Cup - even became a punchline in the sitcom Friends. That game in Los Angeles attracted a crowd of more than 90,000 people, the biggest ever for a women's match. The story of women's football in Brazil is marred by sexism. The game was actually outlawed in 1941 by then dictator Getulio Vargas - and the prohibition was only lifted in 1979. Without a proper grassroots system and a strong league, the women's team has actually punched above its weight by reaching the 2007 final and the semi-finals in 1999. And Brazil have also produced the woman voted the best player of all-time: Marta. Brazil's Marta has been voted several times as the best player on the planet but World Cup glory has eluded her so far World governing body Fifa's latest census of the woman's game, in 2014, established that there were more 30 million female players worldwide. About half of them were based in the US and Canada. In the whole of South America, Fifa counted a little over 255,000 players. The US numbers are also impressive at grassroots level: national governing body US Soccer says that women amount to 47% of all players at high-school level, and 53% at university competitions. ""Many other countries in Europe are still lagging in the women's movement, and even in Brazil, where soccer is a cultural phenomenon, women have struggled to gain recognition and access to basic resources,"" economist and author Stefan Szymanski told American radio PBS earlier this year. America has strong numbers at grassroots level in football The 23-women squad sent by the US to the 2019 Women's World Cup in France is formed from players taking part in the National Women's Soccer League, one of the strongest and most-watched competitions in the world of women's football. Players have a minimum annual wage of $16,500 and a maximum of $46,200. As for Brazil, 16 players are based abroad, plying their trade in places as diverse as South Korea and Denmark, as the domestic league struggles to attract the interest of public, sponsors and media. The seven games of the opening round of the 2019 Campeonato Brasileiro had less than 10,000 people in attendance, despite many clubs giving tickets away for free. Wages are hardly enticing: a survey by news portal UOL in 2017 showed that three out of four players earned less than $6,000 a year. Brazilian women's football struggles with funding and exposure In sporting tournaments like the World Cup, experience is an asset. A point proven by a quick look at the number of matches played by the American stars. On average, each of the 23 American players in France has played for her country 75 times. For Brazil, the average is 40. ""When we go to a competition like the World Cup we face teams that train together and play together more than us. We lack both in the physical and psychological departments,"" says former Brazil captain Juliana Cabral. Brazil kicked off their 2019 World Cup with acomfortable 3-0 win over Jamaica- striker Cristiane scoring a hat-trick in the victory. The US begin their tournament on Tuesday against Thailand in Reims, while Brazil are next in action against Australia on Thursday in Montpellier.

"In the race to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative party and prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are setting out how they want to run the UK. They have both announced taxation and spending plans. So, what are the details and do their sums add up? People would only start to pay the higher rate of income tax when they earn at least Â£80,000, under Boris Johnson's plans The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan, the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not affect Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the ceiling for NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and it is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost due to national insurance increases). Is there a Brexit war chest? Hammond calls for honesty on spending pledges Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay national insurance to begin with. So if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only will they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also won't be affected by the national insurance rise. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost around Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from the Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been ear-marked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can only be spent once. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson will need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Raise public sector pay and increase school funding What it means:A leading supporter of Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, told the Times that the days of public sector pay freezes under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and rises were capped at 1% in 2013. The government announced an end to the pay cap in 2017, and some public sector workers have negotiated increases above 1% since then. The candidate himself has declined to specify by how much he would increase pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He has also pledged to fund increased investment in special needs education, as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. The cost:We don't know by how much Mr Johnson wants to increase public sector pay, butthe IFS says,externalthat each 1% increase in pay for the public sector workforce costs the government about Â£1.8bn a year. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022 What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson plans to reverse almost all of those cuts on the basis that ""more people on our streets means more people are kept safe"". There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson gave a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas around Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year, but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes around two years. Typically, after four years, the pay would increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m, but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be around Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers, but again, this will differ from force to force. Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says that they would recruit special constables, who are trained as police officers but work part time, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Cut corporation tax to 12.5% What it means:From April 2020, instead of paying 17% tax on their profits, companies would pay 12.5%. The foreign secretary is in favour of cutting the rate of corporation tax - the tax that companies pay on their profits - to 12.5%, which is the same rate as in the Republic of Ireland. The government is already planning a series of cuts to corporation tax, which was cut from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017, and is scheduled to fall to 17% next year. The idea of cutting it by another 4.5 percentage pointscame in a report,externalby another Conservative MP at the end of May. The cost:The government estimates the policy would cost about Â£14bn a year. That cost would be reduced if future tax takes were to be boosted by companies being attracted to move to the UK to take advantage of the lower tax rate, or if companies use the money saved to pay higher wages or invest it in improving their productivity. How much that would reduce the cost is very hard to predict. The plan:Take 90% of businesses out of business rates What it means:Business rates are a local tax paid on the use of buildings for non-domestic purposes. The cost:We haven't seen any formal costings of this policy, but in the2018 Budget, Philip Hammonddecided to give a one-third discount on business rates to high street retail businesses with a rateable value below Â£51,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Treasury said that would benefit 90% of high street retail businesses. The Office for Budget Responsibility said,externalthe discount would cost Â£490m this year and Â£450m next year. It means we can estimate that a 100% cut for those businesses would cost an extra Â£900m next year and about Â£1.35bn a year after that. Business rates are currently collected by local authorities, which retain half of the money. Central government is reimbursing them for the one-third cut and would presumably also reimburse them for the 100% cut. The plan:Increase annual investment allowance to Â£5m What it means:If you are running a business and you buy equipment such as computers or machinery, you can deduct the amount you spend on it from your profits to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. There is a limit,externalto the amount you can deduct, which is called the annual investment allowance. At the start of this year it was raised from Â£200,000 to Â£1m for two years. The cost:We do not have a costing for this measure either, but to get an idea of the amounts of money involved,the OBR said,externalthe temporary increase to Â£1m would cost Â£600m this year. The plan:Money for fishing, farming and defence What it means:Jeremy Hunt would increase spending on defence from its current level of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP - the sum of everything the UK produces each year) to 2.5% of GDP by 2023-4. He has also said he would have a ""relief programme"" for the fishing and farming sectors to help them deal with the effects of a possible no-deal Brexit. The cost:The boost to defence spending would cost Â£15bn a year by 2023-4. The relief for fishing and farming would cost Â£6bn. Mr Hunt says his overall plans would ""kick-start the economy and create extra growth"", which would mean the government had extra money to spend. But the disruption involved in leaving the EU with no deal is widely expected to reduce growth - at least initially - which would mean that increased taxes or borrowing or reduced spending in other areas would be required to fund the extra spending.

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

"This video can not be played ""My daughter deserved justice at all costs,"" the girl's mother told the BBC Three men have been jailed for life for the rape, torture and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Indian-administered Kashmir. Three police officers were found guilty of destroying evidence and sentenced to five years in prison. The victim, who belonged to a Muslim nomadic tribe, was found in a forest near Kathua city in January 2018. The case sparked widespread anger and made headlines when Hindu right-wing groups protested over the men's arrest. Eight people, including a former government official, four policemen and a minor, were charged in connection with the crime. One of them has been acquitted and the minor is set to be tried separately. All of them had pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The case became one among many high-profile ones that prompted India to pass a new law which introduced death penalty for anyone convicted of raping a child under 12. But it is still left to the judge's discretion to decide whether or not to hand out a death sentence. The eight-year-old girl went missing in the new year of 2018 and her battered body was discovered almost three weeks later. According to investigators, the child was confined to a local temple for several days and given sedatives that kept her unconscious. The charge sheet alleged that she was ""raped for days, tortured and then finally murdered"". They added that the child was targeted because the men wished to terrorise the tribe - known as Gujjars - into leaving. Why did India wake up so late to a child rape and murder? Do India's 'fast track' courts work? India child gang rape trial moved out of Kashmir A child is sexually abused every 15 minutes in India, according to government crime figures up to 2016, and there has been a steady rise in offences against children. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children in the world, but there is a reluctance to talk about the topic so the real number of cases could be much higher. Seven men were tried in a specially convened fast-track court on Monday and six were found guilty. Investigators said that Sanjhi Ram, a 60-year-old retired government officer, allegedly planned the crime with the help of police officers Surinder Verma, Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Deepak Khajuria. The case triggered widespread anger across India Ram's son, Vishal, his nephew, a juvenile, and his friend, Parvesh Kumar, were also accused over the rape and murder. While Vishal was acquitted, Ram, Khajuria and Kumar have been sentenced for life. The remaining three have been handed five-year sentences. After the verdict, the lawyer representing the child's family told BBC Punjabi that it was a ""victory of constitutional spirit"". He added that  ""the whole country fought this case, irrespective of religious affiliations"". The lawyer representing the accused said that despite the conviction, the case was based on ""circumstantial evidence"" and has pleaded for minimum punishment for the six men. He added that there were mitigating circumstances, including the fact that the men were the sole breadwinners in their families. Divya Arya, BBC News, Anantnag When I met the girl's mother, she was on a hilltop alongside her elder daughter and several other members of the family. They were surrounded by their sheep and goats, which were grazing, and they did not know that this verdict had come out. When I informed the girl's mother that six of the accused had been convicted, she began to cry and blessed me for being the bearer of good news. She said the family could not afford to travel to Pathankot to hear the verdict because selling livestock was their only source of income. ""I have always believed in justice and God gave me strength to fight for it,"" she said. She added that if the two main accused were not sentenced to death, she and her husband would challenge the sentence. ""We will not eat or drink but we will get justice for our daughter,"" she said. The girl's elder sister, who is 15, says she and other girls her age now live in ""constant fear of Hindu men"" and never leave the house unless they are accompanied by an older family member. Although promptly reported in Indian-administered Kashmir, it only made headlines in the rest of the country in April after Hindu groups marched in support of the accused. But as details of the injuries inflicted on the child became public, horrified Indians protested across the country. Outrage grew after two ministers from India's governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused men, whose community was involved in a land dispute with the nomadic tribe the girl belonged to. The child's mother has demanded capital punishment for two of those convicted - retired government officer Sanji Ram and police officer Deepak Khajuria - claiming that they were the ""masterminds"" behind the crime. ""My daughter's face still haunts me and that pain will never leave me. When I see other children of her age playing around me, it breaks my heart,"" she told the BBC. Despite the outrage, the victim's parents said they felt threatened in Kathua, where the community is predominantly Hindu. The sentiment around the case prompted the top court to move the trial out of Jammu and Kashmir to a court in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab and start the trial afresh.

"NASUWT members at Buchanan High have voted to strike Teachers at a North Lanarkshire school have voted for strike action over health concerns at an education campus. Concerns had been raised about ""blue water"" coming from pipes and possible chemical contamination at the Townhead Road complex, built on a former landfill in Coatbridge. The NASUWT union which represents 12 staff at Buchanan High School said they would be withdrawn from 20 to 28 June. North Lanarkshire Council insisted there was no evidence of health risks. The campus, which includes Buchanan High, St Ambrose High and Townhead Road community centre, opened in 2012 on land which had been used for industrial waste including lead and arsenic, between 1945 and 1972. At the time of planning, concerns were lodged over possible contamination. In March 2018, bottled water was used at the high schools after blue water was discovered coming from pipes. Test later revealed higher than recommended copper levels. The campus is home to two secondary schools Officials said this was due to corrosion but insisted there was no health risk. About 1,800m of copper piping has since been replaced with plastic piping. Concern has grown in recent weeks after it emerged that four former or current members of staff at Buchanan High had received treatment for cancer. The NASUWT union has now announced seven days of strike action at Buchanan High which is an additional support needs school catering for about 100 pupils. A spokeswoman said: ""Whilst the NASUWT is in dispute over the situation at the school we have taken the unprecedented step of removing our members from the school site because of the serious health and safety concerns. A meeting was held at Townhead Community Centre last week ""The failure of the employer to act to address these concerns is unacceptable and our legal advisers are also taking appropriate action. ""No stone should be left unturned when the health of staff and pupils is at risk. ""The NASUWT should not be in a position where we have to take such action, but if an employer fails to act appropriately we will."" A public meeting at the campus on Thursday grew heated as parents voiced concerns. Hundreds gathered at Townhead Community Centre to question council and NHS officials on whether the blue water in the pipes was a health risk and if there was any risk from contaminants at the former landfill site. A public health expert told the meeting the particular cancers reported had a long ""latency period"" between exposure to environmental triggers and onset of disease, suggesting the campus could not be a causal factor. A statement issued by North Lanarkshire Council on Monday said:  ""Specialist doctors from the public health department of NHS Lanarkshire have confirmed that no incidence of cancer is linked to the schools. They have also confirmed that no other serious illness is connected to the schools or the site on which they are built. ""The council will liaise directly with trade unions on matters of concern to staff. All the facts demonstrate that the schools and the site on which they are built is safe.""

"Iran said last month that it would quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium The head of the global nuclear watchdog has confirmed Iran is increasing its production of enriched uranium. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said it was not clear when they will reach a limit set under a 2015 international deal. Iran announced last month that it would suspend some commitments in retaliation for sanctions reinstated by the US. Mr Amano also said he was worried about the current tensions over the Iranian nuclear issue and called for dialogue. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later said reducing tensions was only possible by stopping what he called the ""economic war by America"". ""Those who wage such wars cannot expect to remain safe,"" he told a news conference during a visit to Tehran by his German counterpart, Heiko Maas. Mr Maas warned that the situation in the region was ""highly explosive and extremely serious"" and could lead to a military escalation between the US and Iran. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? US President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal last year and reinstated sanctions that had been lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. Then last month, he ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions for countries that continued buying oil from Iran. This decision was intended to bring Iranian oil exports to zero, denying their government its main source of revenue. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? Days later, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country was rolling back some restrictions under the deal. This included no longer complying with caps on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water - set at 300kg and 130 tonnes respectively - and halting sales of surplus supplies overseas. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium that would be suitable for a bomb. Mr Rouhani also gave the other five states still party to the nuclear deal - Germany, the UK, France, China and Russia - until 7 July to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions. Otherwise Iran will suspend its restrictions on the purity of enriched uranium. At the same time, the White House sent an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers, and a Patriot missile defence battery to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. This video can not be played The BBC was invited on board the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea Iran was subsequently accused by the US of being behind attacks on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates; two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia; and the Green Zone in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where many foreign embassies are located. Iran denied the allegations. Then, on 20 May, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran announced that it would quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium and had informed the IAEA, which is tasked with monitoring Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. On Monday, the nuclear watchdog's chief confirmed that Iran had increased its production rate. But Mr Amano declined to specify by how much and said it was not clear when the stockpile limit would be exceeded. He told the IAEA's Board of Governors it was essential that Iran fully implemented its commitments,externalunder the nuclear deal. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said he was worried about the tensions over the Iranian nuclear issue ""As I have constantly emphasised, the nuclear-related commitments entered into by Iran under the [deal] represent a significant gain for nuclear verification,"" he said. ""I therefore hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue."" Germany's Foreign Minister stressed that European powers wanted to fulfil their obligations under the deal and were attempting to provide Iran with alternative ways to trade. ""We cannot work miracles, but we will try to avert a failure,"" Mr Maas said. The Europeans have set up a ""special purpose vehicle"" that would essentially allow goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. But the mechanism - known as Instex - is not yet operational.

"Boris Johnson wins first ballot by MPs, getting 114 votes Three contenders - Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom and Mark Harper - eliminated Jeremy Hunt comes second, followed by Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart The seven remaining candidates go through to more votes next week Jennifer Scott and Richard Morris How does Boris Johnson plan to deliver Brexit in under 100 days? We take a look at the two Conservative MPs going head-to-head to become the next prime minister. Conservative MPs have chosen the final two candidates in the race to become the next leader of their party - and, therefore, the next UK prime minister. Three MPs are knocked out in the race to succeed Theresa May, as Boris Johnson secures more than a third of votes. That's where we'll leave our live coverage for today - thanks for joining us.

The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"". But he said the candidates needed to have a ""proper debate on the vision for the country"". He told the BBC: ""There are a lot of candidates with a lot to offer but we are
right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip.""

The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress.

chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

"An ""unprecedented"" number of calls from the public during the London Bridge killings left police thinking they may be facing a ""Mumbai-style"" attack. The inquest into the attack heard there were more than 500 unverified reports, including claims of sustained gunfire and hostage-taking. Officers feared co-ordinated shootings and bombings, as in the 2008 killings in India. Eight people were killed with a van and knives in the 2017 London attack. In the space of three minutes the attackers struck Xavier Thomas, 45, and Christine Archibald, 30, with a van on the bridge, before fatally stabbing Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, around Borough Market. Another 48 people were injured in the killings on 3 June 2017. Services mark London Bridge anniversary Officer denies missed chances over London Bridge London attacker's widow 'will not grieve' Ten minutes after Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, had begun their assault, they were shot dead by firearms officers. Supt Ross McKibbin, who led the first few hours of the police investigation, told the inquest at the Old Bailey officers initially believed there was ""a potential"" that more than three suspects might have been involved. As the ""chaotic"" information came in, they also feared that there could have been suicide bombs in use, he said. ""We have got members of the public calling us about things they can hear rather than see, so they think they are under sustained gunfire,"" said the officer, who is part of the Specialist Firearms Command. The victims of the London Bridge attack (clockwise from top left): Christine Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Among the calls on the night of the attacks were reports of a shooting in the Elephant and Castle area, the inquest heard. Supt McKibbin said these reports were false but ""these are not people who were trying to divert resources, these are people who felt they were genuinely under attack"". Victims of the London Bridge attack The November 2008 attacks in Mumbai involved a series of co-ordinated shootings and bombings at luxury hotels and the city's largest train station, killing 166 people. Asked if police feared a similar incident might be unfolding on the night of the London Bridge attacks, Supt McKibben said: ""Absolutely."" Hanna Yusuf, BBC News Leading the initial police response to the attack, Supt Ross McKibbin had seen the ""carnage"" unfolding on London Bridge via CCTV footage from the roof of St Thomas' Hospital. In court, he said the Met Police and City of London forces were overwhelmed by the amount of information that came in on that night. He repeatedly described what he and his force witnessed as ""chaos"", saying that it was ""effectively a war zone on the streets of London"". Police, he said, received more than 500 pieces of unverified information over the phone - an unprecedented number of calls about a single incident. He emphasised the fact that this was an ""extremely complex policing operation"" when pressed by lawyer Gareth Patterson on why ambulances did not locate victims faster. ""It was without a doubt the single most challenging shift I have experienced in 24 years of operational policing,"" said Supt McKibbin. Supt McKibbin also offered ""sincere condolences"" to the parents and fiancee of Xavier Thomas for not being able to save his life. Police treating casualties of the attacks did not have the technology to see the locations of ambulances and were unaware they were waiting in a safe place nearby, he said. Some victims waited 25 minutes to be treated by paramedics. He told the inquest there was ""absolutely"" a case for giving police equipment that would allow them to see the location of ambulance personnel or vehicles. The inquest continues.

"A ""dramatic"" fall in car production and an easing of stockpiling by manufacturers meant the economy shrank in April, official figures show. The economy contracted 0.4% from the month before,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external The contraction meant growth for the three months to April slowed to 0.3%. Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit slashed UK car production in April by nearly half,the industry said last month. BMW's Mini factory in Oxford brought forward its summer maintenance shutdown to April to minimise any disruption surrounding Brexit. Other manufacturers' annual stoppages were also brought forward. The economy had seen a spurt of growth in the run-up to the proposed March date for the UK leaving the European Union, as manufacturers stockpiled parts, raw materials and goods in the anticipation of holdups at the border. After the Brexit deadline was extended to October, it suffered the reverse effects as these supply reserves were used up and fewer purchases were made. ""The hangover that's followed the UK's original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated, said Yael Selfin, chief economist at accountants KPMG UK. ""Today's figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty."" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said: ""Growth showed some weakening across the latest three months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. ""There was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK's original EU departure date has faded."" By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent If you are going to cancel a party it is always polite to give your guests as much notice as possible. After all, that could well save them the expense of buying a present, booking a baby sitter, splashing out on new clothes etc. Unfortunately Theresa May gave British industry only a few days' notice that Brexit was being postponed and it was just too late to stop carefully-honed plans swinging into operation. Many businesses feared Brexit would cause at least temporary disruption, so they had been stockpiling components and finished goods to tide them over, and they have been using those stores up rather than producing more. The car industry brought forward its annual shutdown - usually used to put in new equipment, prepare for new models and so on. As a result, car production fell off a cliff and manufacturing as a whole fell by nearly 4% in just one month. Growth may bounce back, but then Brexit is now scheduled for 31 October. How do companies plan for that? Repeat the whole operation again or not bother? Certainly the car industry won't want another shutdown, it has already had one this year and Brexit could still be delayed again. The contraction in April was far sharper than economists had expected. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest ""underlying growth is pretty sluggish"". ""With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year."" The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has estimated car production for the whole of 2019 will be about 10% down on last year. It says the market might pick up by the end of the year if there is a favourable deal between the UK and the EU, and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market. But it has said a no-deal Brexit will make the declines worse, with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""While monthly figures are always changeable, the fundamentals of our economy are strong and it has grown every year since 2010. Employment levels are at a record high and wages growing in real terms.""

"Free TV licences for up to 3.7m pensioners are being scrapped, the BBC has announced. Under the new rules, only low-income households where one person receives the pension credit benefit will still be eligible for a free licence. In 2015, the government announced the BBC wouldtake over the cost of providing free licences for over-75s by 2020as part of the fee settlement. But that would have cost Â£745m, a fifth of the BBC's budget, by 2021/22. The new scheme will cost the BBC around Â£250 million by 2021/22 depending on the take-up. Funding free TV licences for all over-75s would have resulted in ""unprecedented closures"", the BBC said. The broadcaster said that BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5live, and a number of local radio stations would all have been at risk. The BBC said ""fairness"" was at the heart of the ruling, which comes into force in June 2020. It follows a consultation with 190,000 people, of whom 52% were in favour of reforming or abolishing free licences. Free TV licence recipients 'richer' BBC consultation on over-75s licence fee TV Licence fee rises by Â£4 According to the BBC, around 900,000 households are claiming pension credit, which is a government benefit paid weekly to pensioners on low incomes. The number of households which could be eligible to apply for pension credit could number 1.5 million by 2020. BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" but this was the ""the fairest and best outcome"". This video can not be played David Clementi on the BBC's decision to scrap blanket free licences for over 75s But Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very disappointed"" with the BBC's decision. A government spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that we want and expect the BBC to continue this concession. ""People across the country value television as a way to stay connected, and we want the BBC to look at further ways to support older people."" The spokesman said taxpayers want to see the BBC using licence fee income better, including ""showing restraint on salaries for senior staff"". But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the government bore responsibility for the ""outrage"" of charging over-75s the licence fee, having promised to maintain free licences in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto. ""Millions of elderly and isolated people will lose because of this announcement,"" he said. Free licences were given to the over-75s as part of a Labour government programme to reduce pensioner poverty. Fifteen years later that government funding was cut by the Conservatives. Ever since then, the BBC has been pondering if it can afford to take on the bill. It's a cost that's rising every year as the number of pensioners continues to grow. In 2020 it's estimated there will be around 4.6 million households with at least one pensioner. This then is a compromise; around a third of the cost will be borne by the BBC and two thirds passed on to 'wealthier' pensioners. The elderly are by far the biggest consumers of the BBC's output, the average age of BBC TV's audience is now over 62, the question is how far younger licence fee payers should subsidise these older viewers. As consumption of traditional TV by younger viewers continues to drop there could well be questions about why they are being expected to pay for a service that the heaviest users get for free. One in four over-65s say the TV is their main form of companionship, according to Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK. She said: ""Make no mistake, if this scheme goes ahead we are going to see sick and disabled people in their eighties and nineties who are completely dependent on their cherished TV for companionship and news forced to give it up."" Elderly people are likely to feel ""enormous anxiety and distress, and some anger too"", she said, adding: ""But in the end this is the government's fault, not the BBC's."" The National Pensioners Convention said the BBC ""has done the government's dirty work for it"". But the Intergenerational Foundation, a charity which supports the interests of younger members of society, said it was fairer to make wealthier pensioners pay. ""There is simply no reason why retired judges, lawyers, bankers and doctors should receive a free TV licence when younger generations are struggling financially,"" the charity said.

"The exterior of the BBC's New Broadcasting House building A report looking at free TV licences for the over-75s suggests older households have seen ""a marked improvement"" in their living standards since the policy was introduced. The BBC-commissioned report said pensioners are now less likely than any other age group to live in poverty. The government began funding free TV licences for the over-75s in 2000. In 2015 it was decided the concession would be paid for in future by the BBC. According tothe report by Frontier Economics,external, which was commissioned to carry out the research, almost half (46%) of households with someone aged 75 or more were among the poorest in terms of incomes in 2000. By 2017, that proportion had fallen to fewer than one in three (32%). The paper says this has come about ""because incomes of over-75 households have grown much more rapidly than average"". It goes on: ""Incomes, wealth and life expectancy of older people have improved significantly, pensioner poverty rates have fallen, and older households report higher well-being on a range of metrics."" The government's contribution to the free TV licence is being phased out by 2020. Parliament has given the corporation the duty to consult on what the policy should be for the older population thereafter. Free TV licences were brought in when Gordon Brown was chancellor In 2001, free licence fees for the over-75s cost the government Â£365m. The report forecasts that by 2021 the current arrangements will cost the BBC Â£745m a year - constituting a fifth of the licence fee income. A full report from Frontier Economics on longer-term funding options relating to the over-75s concession will be published in the next few weeks. The BBC will then produce its own public consultation paper exploring various options. Reforms to the policy may include raising the age of eligibility, introducing means-testing or removing the benefit from older people who live with younger relatives. Writing in The Times, former cabinet secretary and chairman of Frontier Economics Lord O'Donnell said it was ""a complex issue"". ""Different approaches need to be considered in economic, financial, distributional and feasibility terms,"" he went on. ""Any final decision will ultimately be one for the BBC based on a wider consultation process."" As Gus O'Donnell, Lord O'Donnell was cabinet secretary from 2005 to 2011 ""This is an important discussion paper which we are studying carefully,"" said a BBC spokesperson. ""The full report - which looks at a range of approaches the BBC could take - will be published shortly. ""As we have said, the government concession ends in June 2020. We are going to be consulting on what then happens. It might be a concession on the same terms, it might be different concession. ""There are important issues to consider. We will do nothing without consulting with the public. Everyone who wants to contribute will be able to do so."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director atAge UK,external, said there were ""compelling arguments in favour of the over 75s TV licence concession"". ""Despite some creditable improvement over the last decade, significant numbers of older people are still poor and progress in reducing pensioner poverty has stalled. ""The question for the BBC is therefore how they intend to fulfil the responsibility they have taken on as regards the TV licence concession for the over 75s... the majority of whom live on only modest incomes.""

"Christine says victims of scams need to speak up about their experiences When two men knocked on Christine's door saying her gutters needed cleaning and roof tiles needed replacing she agreed, and handed them Â£520. That was a mistake. ""When they were finished one said he'd give me a certificate for a 10-year guarantee. ""But when he went to the van to get it, he just drove off. I looked at the gutters and I could still see the weeds."" The 70-year-old from Sussex never saw the cash again - she had been scammed. ""The worst part was that it didn't seem, or feel, like a scam. They looked professional and said they'd completed work on my neighbours' houses,"" Christine said. She's one of almost 20,000 victims of similar scams who complained to Citizens Advice last year, an increase of 8% from the previous year. Many victims ended up much more out of pocket than Christine: fraudsters on average cheated people out of almost Â£3,000 through these types of scams. Scams sent through the post hit people even more, with the average loss at Â£5,435. ""Tried-and-tested scams still pose a huge threat,"" warned Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, which along with Trading Standards has launched a Scams Awareness campaign. Scam victims to be refunded by banks Millions lost in 'celebrity-backed scams' Police 'avoid' investigating fraud cases ""Even in this digital age where online scams are on the rise, scammers are continuing to use traditional routes to prey on people. ""Tactics like doorstep selling, sending unsolicited letters and cold calling give scammers the opportunity to build a relationship with their victim."" The campaign - which has the slogan ""Stop, report, talk: Be #scamaware"" - hopes to encourage people to talk about their experiences and look out for others. ""People need to speak up about this sort of thing,"" says Christine. ""Had I known the warning signs of scams - like being asked to pay up front in cash - alarm bells would've rung and I'd have thought twice about handing over my money."" If you're worried that someone you know has become victim to a scam, look out for the following. Are they: Receiving more mail than usual? Receiving unsolicited calls or spending more time on the phone? Struggling with money or have they withdrawn large amounts of cash recently? If you think someone you know is being scammed, take the following steps: If you're worried about telephone scams look into installing a call blocker Encourage them to tell their bank immediately if there is any suspicious activity or transactions from their account or credit cards Report the scam to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service online or by phone on 03454 04 05 06. They will give you advice on what to do next and report the scam to Trading Standards Report the scam to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 ""We believe that the number of complaints about these scams is the tip of the iceberg - only 5% of scams are reported,"" warned Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards. He added that scams which do not take place online can cause significant harm emotionally as well as financially, particularly when people - often in vulnerable situations - are deceived and put under pressure in their own homes. Research by Citizens Advice showed three out of five people reported being targeted by a scam in the past two years. Of those targeted, less than half said they told anyone about it. ""We must work together to combat fraudsters by being more open about scams and helping each other understand what to look for,"" said Gillian Guy.

Funding free TV licences for all over-75s would have resulted in ""unprecedented closures"", the BBC said. The broadcaster said that BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5live, and a number of local radio stations would all have been at risk. The BBC said ""fairness"" was at the heart of the ruling, which comes into force in June 2020. It follows a consultation with 190,000 people, of whom 52% were in favour of reforming or abolishing free licences. Free TV licence recipients 'richer' BBC consultation on over-75s licence fee TV Licence fee rises by Â£4 According to the BBC, around 900,000 households are claiming pension credit, which is a government benefit paid weekly to pensioners on low incomes. The number of households which could be eligible to apply for pension credit could number 1.5 million by 2020. BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" but this was the ""the fairest and best outcome"". This video can not be played David Clementi on the BBC's decision to scrap blanket free licences for over 75s But Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very disappointed"" with the BBC's decision. A government spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that we want and expect the BBC to continue this concession. ""People across the country value television as a way to stay connected, and we want the BBC to look at further ways to support older people."" The spokesman said taxpayers want to see the BBC using licence fee income better, including ""showing restraint on salaries for senior staff"". But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the government bore responsibility for the ""outrage"" of charging over-75s the licence fee, having promised to maintain free licences in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto. ""Millions of elderly and isolated people will lose because of this announcement,"" he said. Free licences were given to the over-75s as part of a Labour government programme to reduce pensioner poverty. Fifteen years later that government funding was cut by the Conservatives. Ever since then, the BBC has been pondering if it can afford to take on the bill. It's a cost that's rising every year as the number of pensioners continues to grow. In 2020 it's estimated there will be around 4.6 million households with at least one pensioner. This then is a compromise; around a third of the cost will be borne by the BBC and two thirds passed on to 'wealthier' pensioners. The elderly are by far the biggest consumers of the BBC's output, the average age of BBC TV's audience is now over 62, the question is how far younger licence fee payers should subsidise these older viewers. As consumption of traditional TV by younger viewers continues to drop there could well be questions about why they are being expected to pay for a service that the heaviest users get for free. One in four over-65s say the TV is their main form of companionship, according to Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK. She said: ""Make no mistake, if this scheme goes ahead we are going to see sick and disabled people in their eighties and nineties who are completely dependent on their cherished TV for companionship and news forced to give it up."" Elderly people are likely to feel ""enormous anxiety and distress, and some anger too"", she said, adding: ""But in the end this is the government's fault, not the BBC's."" The National Pensioners Convention said the BBC ""has done the government's dirty work for it"". But the Intergenerational Foundation, a charity which supports the interests of younger members of society, said it was fairer to make wealthier pensioners pay. ""There is simply no reason why retired judges, lawyers, bankers and doctors should receive a free TV licence when younger generations are struggling financially,"" the charity said.

In 2015, the Conservative government announced the BBC wouldtake over the cost of providing free licences for over-75s by 2020as part of the fee settlement. Following the announcement, TV Licensing is advising customers receiving a free licence that they need not take any immediate action. Over the course of the next month, TV Licensing will be writing to everyone who currently has a free over-75 licence to let them know about the new scheme and make clear that they will remain fully covered until 31 May 2020. A free telephone information line will also be launched this month where older customers and their relatives can access information on the new policy and a new ""pay as you go"" payment scheme will be launched from June 2020 which will let people spread the cost of the licence in fortnightly or monthly payments. The BBC's consultation was announced in November last year. Nearly half of respondents (48%) said they were in favour of continuing concessions to over-75s. Reforming the current rules was backed by 37% of respondents, with 15% in favour of scrapping concessions of over-75s.

"US lawyers representing Grenfell survivors and victims' relatives are expected to file a lawsuit More than 100 Grenfell survivors and relatives are taking legal action in the US against three firms they blame for the fire, the BBC has been told. The lawsuit will target the cladding maker Arconic, insulation maker Celotex and fridge supplier Whirlpool. A successful action in the US could cost the firms involved tens of millions of dollars in damages. Whirlpool and Arconic said they would not comment on the case while official investigations into the fire continued. Celotex told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was ""considering its position"" in relation to the legal action. The Grenfell fire in June 2017 claimed the lives of 72 people and another 70 were injured. The first phase of the public inquiry into the disaster heard expert evidence that a small kitchen fire broke out through a uPVC window fitting and ignited material attached to the building. The new exterior cladding and insulation was installed in 2016 as part of a Â£10m refit of the tower. US lawyers representing Grenfell survivors and victims' relatives are expected to file the lawsuit this week in Philadelphia under product liability law, which is meant to hold firms responsible for injuries caused by the goods they sell. The state of Pennsylvania was reportedly chosen as the legal jurisdiction for the suit because both Arconic, which supplied the combustible ACM panels, and Celotex, which manufactured the insulation, have their US headquarters there. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell inquiry: What is happening? Grenfell Tower: What happened? The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told a number of Grenfell residents have refused to sign up to the action, saying they believe it could become a ""distraction"" from the ongoing public inquiry and criminal investigation. A Grenfell Tower survivor and community leader said: ""We respect those that wish to take action in the US, and we respect those that don't wish to."" A claim is also being brought against another US corporation, Whirlpool, which madethe fridge-freezer in flat 16, which the public inquiry was told was the likely cause of the fire. However, other experts have said there is insufficient evidence to say definitively it was to blame. A civil case for damages has to be started within two years of the fire itself because of the statute of limitations in the US. At least two large US law firms are involved in the action. Lawyers believe the disaster could not have taken place in the US because of tighter fire safety rules and a ban on the use of similar cladding on high-rise residential buildings. Condolence messages written on a wall outside Latymer Community Church in west London Unlike in the UK, any case would be heard by a jury and could lead to much larger financial awards for both compensation and punitive damages. The BBC understands lawyers believe it is impossible to estimate the size of any future award but have indicated that, in 2013, a similar lawsuit related to a building collapse that killed seven people, settled for $227m (Â£178m). Before any case can reach trial, it is believed to be extremely likely all three companies named in the suit will argue it should not be heard in the US because the fire happened in the UK. More than 100 survivors or relatives have signed up to the US legal action. But not every Grenfell family has decided to join, with some survivors thought to be uneasy about pursuing a damages claim outside the UK. One resident told the Victoria Derbyshire programme he did not feel it was ""morally right"" to take action in the US; another described it as ""ugly"" and a ""distraction"" from pursuing Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council and the Tenant Management Organisation, responsible for the tower. The cladding system installed in the tower in 2016 was made up of multiple elements. The thin, outer aluminium panel was made by US metals giant Arconic. A spokesman said the company had no comment on any potential litigation. ""We continue to support the public inquiry and the investigations by the authorities,"" he said. Earlier this year, the $15bn (Â£12bn) sale of Arconic to a US private equity firm broke down. A key issue was said to be the size of any possible financial liabilities linked to the disaster. In May 2018,a BBC investigation claimed the insulation used, manufactured by Celotex, had not passed required safety tests. The BBC's Panorama programme was told that the way Celotex tested and sold the product could amount to corporate manslaughter. The company, owned by French material giant Saint-Gobain, said at the time it could not identify any evidence to support Panorama's allegations. It told the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Monday it was ""considering its position"" in relation to the legal action, which it said it learned about on Friday 7 June. In a statement, it added that it was ""continuing to cooperate fully with the public inquiry"" and remained ""committed to providing all relevant information... to assist it in its work"". ""Celotex reaffirms our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by the fire,"" it continued. The legal process in the US is expected to take several years Whirlpool said two separate investigations found no evidence of any fault with the fridge-freezer model that was in flat 16, and confirmed it complied with safety requirements. ""We are committed to assisting the Grenfell Tower inquiry in any way we can as it continues to investigate all the potential origins and causes of the fire and how it spread, a spokesman said. ""While the inquiry is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" he added. ""Two separate investigations have been carried out - one by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and another by Whirlpool,"" he explained. ""Both investigations independently found no evidence of any fault with this model and confirmed that it fully complied with all safety requirements. These conclusions have also been verified by the government's chief scientific adviser."" He added: ""We would like to reassure owners of these products that they are safe and they can continue to use them as normal."" Under US state law, the legal process is expected to take several years. Lawyers say an initial judgement on whether the case can proceed is likely within six months, with a full trial possible approximately 18 months later in a US courtroom.

"Christine says victims of scams need to speak up about their experiences When two men knocked on Christine's door saying her gutters needed cleaning and roof tiles needed replacing she agreed, and handed them Â£520. That was a mistake. ""When they were finished one said he'd give me a certificate for a 10-year guarantee. ""But when he went to the van to get it, he just drove off. I looked at the gutters and I could still see the weeds."" The 70-year-old from Sussex never saw the cash again - she had been scammed. ""The worst part was that it didn't seem, or feel, like a scam. They looked professional and said they'd completed work on my neighbours' houses,"" Christine said. She's one of almost 20,000 victims of similar scams who complained to Citizens Advice last year, an increase of 8% from the previous year. Many victims ended up much more out of pocket than Christine: fraudsters on average cheated people out of almost Â£3,000 through these types of scams. Scams sent through the post hit people even more, with the average loss at Â£5,435. ""Tried-and-tested scams still pose a huge threat,"" warned Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, which along with Trading Standards has launched a Scams Awareness campaign. Scam victims to be refunded by banks Millions lost in 'celebrity-backed scams' Police 'avoid' investigating fraud cases ""Even in this digital age where online scams are on the rise, scammers are continuing to use traditional routes to prey on people. ""Tactics like doorstep selling, sending unsolicited letters and cold calling give scammers the opportunity to build a relationship with their victim."" The campaign - which has the slogan ""Stop, report, talk: Be #scamaware"" - hopes to encourage people to talk about their experiences and look out for others. ""People need to speak up about this sort of thing,"" says Christine. ""Had I known the warning signs of scams - like being asked to pay up front in cash - alarm bells would've rung and I'd have thought twice about handing over my money."" If you're worried that someone you know has become victim to a scam, look out for the following. Are they: Receiving more mail than usual? Receiving unsolicited calls or spending more time on the phone? Struggling with money or have they withdrawn large amounts of cash recently? If you think someone you know is being scammed, take the following steps: If you're worried about telephone scams look into installing a call blocker Encourage them to tell their bank immediately if there is any suspicious activity or transactions from their account or credit cards Report the scam to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service online or by phone on 03454 04 05 06. They will give you advice on what to do next and report the scam to Trading Standards Report the scam to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 ""We believe that the number of complaints about these scams is the tip of the iceberg - only 5% of scams are reported,"" warned Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards. He added that scams which do not take place online can cause significant harm emotionally as well as financially, particularly when people - often in vulnerable situations - are deceived and put under pressure in their own homes. Research by Citizens Advice showed three out of five people reported being targeted by a scam in the past two years. Of those targeted, less than half said they told anyone about it. ""We must work together to combat fraudsters by being more open about scams and helping each other understand what to look for,"" said Gillian Guy.

"Boris Johnson is frontrunner in the contest to succeed Theresa May Boris Johnson has pledged to cut income tax bills for people earning more than Â£50,000 a year if he wins the race to succeed Theresa May as prime minister. The former foreign secretary told the Telegraph he would use money currently set aside for a no-deal Brexit to raise the 40% tax rate threshold to Â£80,000. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the proposal showed ""how out of touch the Tories are"". Tory MPs have until 17:00 BST to enter the race to become party leader and PM. Mr Johnson's promise comes as Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt both announce they are backing Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for prime minister. Mrs May officially stepped down as the leader of the Conservative Party last week, but will remain as prime minister until her successor is chosen. Conservative MPs who want to replace her must have the backing of eight other party colleagues to officially enter the contest. But Michael Gove, one of 11 to have said they plan to run, has faced calls to drop out of the race after he admitted using cocaine several times more than 20 years ago. This video can not be played Michael Gove: Cocaine use ""was a crime and a mistake"" Former party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said it would be ""hypocrisy of the highest order"" for Mr Gove to remain in the contest, after an article he wrote in 1999 in which he criticised ""middle class professionals"" who took drugs was republished. Apologising on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, the environment secretarysaid he was ""fortunate"" to have avoided prison. And at his campaign launch on Monday, Mr Gove is expected to insist he is ""undaunted"" by criticism, and will say he can both deliver Brexit and ""stop Jeremy Corbyn ever getting the keys to Downing Street"". Latest: Race to be Tory leader - and next PM The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know Where do the candidates stand on Brexit? The UK cities with the highest and lowest wages Meanwhile, Mr Johnson told the Telegraph he planned to cut income tax bills for three million people, partly by using money from a pot set aside by the Treasury for a possible no-deal Brexit, and partly by increasing employee National Insurance payments in line with the new income tax threshold. The paper estimates,externalthe move announced by Mr Johnson, who is not doing any media interviews, would cost Â£9.6bn a year. ""We should be raising thresholds of income tax so that we help the huge numbers that have been captured in the higher rate by fiscal drag,"" said Mr Johnson, who gets paid Â£79,468 as an MP. Paul Johnson, from think tank the Institute For Fiscal Studies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme higher rate taxpayers would receive a ""quite significant tax cut"" under Mr Johnson's plans - but the biggest beneficiaries would include wealthy pensioners, and people living solely off investments, as neither pay National Insurance. And shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said the Tory leadership contest was becoming a ""race to the bottom in tax cuts"". He said: ""With our schools, care for the elderly and our police services at breaking point, Boris Johnson's proposals to give a tax cut to high earners reveals how out of touch the Tories are."" Income of up to Â£8,632:Individuals pay 0% Â£8,632 - Â£12,500:12% (National Insurance only) Â£12,500 - Â£50,000:32% (Income tax at 20%, NI at 12%) Â£50,000 - Â£100,000:42% (Income tax at 40%, NI at 2%) (The Scottish Government sets its own income tax rates) Justice Secretary David Gauke, a former chief secretary to the Treasury,tweeted,externalthat Mr Johnson's tax announcement was the ""wrong priority"". Former Commons Leader and leadership contender Andrea Leadsom told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""in reality, in this Parliament, it would be impossible to actually get wholesale tax changes through"". And Dominic Raab launched a direct attack on Mr Johnson's proposal at his leadership launch, saying he would rather cut the lowest paid's taxes rather than what would be interpreted as ""the caricature that you're the party of privilege and you are only in it to help the wealthy"". Tory MP Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee and is backing Mr Gove in the leadership contest, said: ""The question for Boris is, why is this a priority when you could be obviously lifting more people out of paying income tax - the lower rate taxpayers - or you could be give people receiving child benefit an extra Â£15 a week?"" She added Mr Gove had been ""very candid about having made a mistake and he is right to say people shouldn't be defined by the worst mistakes they have made"". Now the contest proper gets under way. This is the week where we really will get a chance to start looking at people's policies. It's very hard to see how a cut in income tax for wealthier earners would fly through Parliament, but there are going to be all sorts of proposals like this. So there will be - whatever big headlines are flying around at the top of this noisiest wave of the campaign - proper debates on the direction of the party and, therefore, the direction of the government too. Should they, as Boris Johnson would suggest, cut the income tax for wealthier earners, which we know is the antithesis of what some of his colleagues would like to do? Or should they be going in a different direction and try to increase pay for people at the bottom end? These are all tensions that are alive and well in the Tory party. Ms Rudd, leader of the centrist One Nation Conservative Caucus group and an influential voice on the Remain-supporting wing of the party, told BBC Radio 4's Today that Jeremy Hunt was ""the best shot we have at breaking this impasse"" on Brexit. She said anybody who says the UK is leaving by 31 October ""come hell or high water"" and does not have the relationships to bridge the differences in Europe ""is just taking us towards a general election"". Of Mr Hunt's view, expressed on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, that the legal limit for abortion should be reduced from 24 weeks to 12, Ms Rudd said it was his ""personal, private view"". ""That has always been his view,"" she said. ""I have spoken to Jeremy and there will no change to abortion law if and when he becomes prime minister."" Rudd: Hunt will not change abortion law Launching his campaign for leader on Monday, Mr Hunt said the challenge of Brexit called for an ""experienced, serious leader"", not ""empty rhetoric"". The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who will replace May? BBC to host Tory leader TV debates As the nominations officially open: Health Secretary Matt Hancock told his launch ""we need a fresh start"" and he believed it was up to government to unlock people's potential Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab unveiled proposals to redirect Â£500m a year from the aid budget to create an international wildlife fund to save endangered species and habitats Esther McVey launched her campaign at a fringe event, saying ""we have nothing to fear"" from a no-deal Brexit Home Secretary Sajid Javid picked up further support, with ministers Caroline Nokes and Victoria Atkins choosing to back him afterScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson announced her support on Saturday Mark Harper and Andrea Leadsom will also launch their campaigns on Monday Sam Gyimah says as prime minister he would help young people get on the housing ladder by slashing stamp duty and creating at least a million new homes in five years Rory Stewart used a video message to insist he would not back down in his battle to become Conservative leader BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said five of the candidates appeared to fall short of having eight supporters - the number required to put themselves forward in the contest. However, he noted many Tory MPs had yet to declare who they were backing. Whereas candidates in the past would have only needed two MPs supporting them, senior Tories decided to change the rules earlier this month in a bid to speed up the contest. After nominations close, all 313 Conservative MPs will vote for their preferred candidate in a series of ballots held on 13, 18, 19 and 20 June to whittle down the contenders one by one until only two are left. Due to another rule change, candidates will need to win the votes of at least 16 other MPs in the first ballot and 32 colleagues in the second to proceed. The final two will be put to the 160,000 or so members of the wider Conservative Party in a vote from 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later. On Tuesday 18 June BBC One will be hosting a live election debate between the Conservative MPs who are still in the race.

"Air New Zealand will end a ban on staff having visible tattoos, in a move it says will allow staff to express cultural and individual diversity. Some New Zealanders with Maori heritage wear tattoos to mark their genealogy and heritage. The airline said from 1 September, all employees will be able to display ""non-offensive"" tattoos at work. It said there was growing acceptance of tattoos, particularly as a means of personal expression. The airline's tattoo restrictions attracted criticism and some accused it of hypocrisy for using other aspects of Maori culture - such as language and symbols - in its marketing efforts. Local media also reported the policy shift comes after high-profile cases of individuals who had been refused roles at Air New Zealand because of visible tattoos. Why this face tattoo has got NZ talking The rise of the Maori tribal tattoo Air New Zealand Chief Executive Officer Christopher Luxon said the firm wanted to embrace diversity and allow employees ""to express individuality or cultural heritage"". ""We want to liberate all our staff including uniform wearers such as cabin crew, pilots and airport customer service teams who will, for the first time, be able to have non-offensive tattoos visible when wearing their uniforms."" The airline said research found one in five adult New Zealanders has at least one tattoo, with more than 35% of people under 30 tattooed. For people of Maori descent, markings known as moko are carved into the skin using chisels. They are a sacred tradition, denoting a person's links with their family and cultural identity. Facial tattoos - moko kauae - are of particular importance. Men's moko tend to cover their entire face, while the women's cover the chin. Air New Zealand said the move to drop the ban followed five months of research with customers and staff. A spokesperson for the national carrier said it would ""treat tattoos like speech"" to determine what would be considered offensive. ""In the same way you shouldn't swear, make hateful comments, lewd jokes, or use violent language in the workplace for example, the same goes for tattoos,"" the spokesperson said. She said where the situation is unclear, the airline will have a Tattoo Review Panel ""to assist employees and managers to determine whether a tattoo is aligned with our policy"".

"This video can not be played WATCH: Keanu Reeves and other highlights at the Xbox event Microsoft has announced that its next-generation console is set to go on sale before the end of 2020. Codenamed Project Scarlett, the firm said that the machine would be the ""biggest leap"" over a previous generation there had ever been. At the E3 games expo, Microsoft said the custom-designed processor, made by AMD, would be four times more powerful than that of the Xbox One X. It added that Halo Infinite would be among its launch titles. However, the company did not show off what the device would look like, or reveal its intended price. Halo's Master Chief guarantees the forthcoming console at least one high-profile launch title The announcement follows similar promisesmade by Sony about the forthcoming PlayStation 5, which is also still in development. ""As expected, with a next-generation Xbox release being at least 17 months away, a full reveal didn't happen,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy IHS Markit. ""Sony had done a similar reveal of next-generation power at a previous investor event, but Microsoft's exposure at E3 and the announcement that Halo Infinite will be a launch title will have positioned it strongly, especially with the US audience."" This was one of the few images that showed what a next-generation game might look like Other details shared about the Xbox One successor included that it will: allow games to be played at up to 120 frames per second support 8K-resolution playback, although it was not clear if this would be limited to video-streaming, or include games as well allow real-time hardware-accelerated ray tracing to create more realistic lighting effects contain a solid-state drive, which will help reduce load times Microsoft teased images of Project Scarlett's circuitry being tested but did not disclose what the machine's case might look like Xbox chief Phil Spencer also strongly hinted that the machine was being designed to take advantage of new internet capabilities, but did not provide specifics. ""When we talk about Xbox in the cloud, when we talk about streaming your games, Project Scarlett and all of its power and all of its performance is the foundation of our future in console and the formation of our future in cloud,"" he said. Another highlight of the Xbox's press conference was a surprise appearance by Keanu Reeves. Keanu Reeves' involvement in Cyberpunk 2077 had not been previously revealed The actor strode on stage to reveal that Cyberpunk 2077 is set to go on sale in April 2020. The future-set role-playing game is being developed by CD Projekt Red, the studio behind the Witcher series. Reeves - who has starred in the Matrix trilogy amongst other sci-fi movies - will also appear in the title. His brief appearance drew huge applause with one attendee shouting: ""You're breathtaking."" ""No, you're breathtaking,"" the actor ad-libbed in reply to laughs from the crowd. The role of Keanu Reeves' character in the game remains a mystery Reeves' involvement guarantees positive publicity for Poland's CD Projekt, which had faced criticism forreportedly putting its team under pressure,externalto do ""extensive overtime"" to have Cyberpunk 2077 ready to demo at E3.

Microsoft showed off about 60 titles in total at its show. Other games included: Elden Ring - a fantasy title created in collaboration between Game of Thrones author George RR Martin and Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki Minecraft Dungeons - a four-play co-operative adventure spin-off from the original block-building game Blair Witch - a ""found footage"" horror title based on the 1999 film The Outer Worlds - a planet-hopping first-person role-playing game a Lego-themed expansion to Microsoft's Forza 4 race-driving title The trailer for Elden Ring feature a severed arm and several characters suffering from crumbling bodies Microsoft also announced that it has launched Xbox Game Pass PC - a subscription service that will allow console titles to be download and played on Windows 10 computers. It said 100 games will be included, including Forza Horizon 4, Metro Exodus and the Halo Master Chief Collection. It will charge $9.99 (Â£7.85) a month to be a member, and users can combine it with an Xbox Live Game Pass Console - which lets games be played on the Xbox One - for $14.99. The firm is also planning to launch a ""beta"" test version of a separate service - xCloud - in October. It will stream Xbox One games from either the firm's data centres or users' own consoles to other devices, including smartphones, allowing gamers to continuing playing when away from home. Microsoft said attendees at E3 would be offered the first public hands-on demonstrations of the technology. Microsoft's Forza 4 video game will get a Lego-themed expansion later this week It should offer a similar experience to Sony's Remote Play, but some attendees were expecting more information to have been disclosed. ""Less details about the service were forthcoming than perhaps expected, calling the idea that it will launch in 2019 into question,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. Microsoft's move comes ahead of the launch of a rival games-streaming service from Google called Stadia. The search giantplans to begin streaming titles in ultra-high definition 4K from November. Amazon is also rumoured to be working on a cloud-based platform of its own. Microsoft hopes existing Xbox Live members will upgrade to stream Xbox games on PCs ""The fact everyone is moving into the streaming space is an indication that everyone is on the right track to where the gaming space is moving to,"" Russ Frushtick, co-founder of games news site Polygon told the BBC. ""The benefit for Microsoft is a subscription model. You can pay [a monthly fee] and then you can stream it to a [low-spec] laptop."" Microsoft is the only one of the big three console-makers holding a press conference at the Los Angeles expo this year. Blair Witch's trailer contained video cam footage in a similar manner to the low-budget film The Blair Witch Project on which it is based Sony has opted to skip the event outright. Nintendo will rely on a pre-recorded video presentation - as it has done since 2013 - but will host a showroom booth where it will demo new games. The Nintendo Direct event is scheduled for 0900 local time (1700 BST) on Tuesday, the same day E3 formally opens its doors. Who knows what Microsoft's business strategy with gaming is? I certainly don't after watching that - but then maybe that was the point. This is a company keeping its options open. I see it shaping up something like this: the new console will be for serious gamers, the types who demand the high-fidelity, premium experience. The type of people who are at E3, which is why the news of the new console was met with such excitement in the room. This crowd was less excited about xCloud, the streaming service, but that's likely because this will be about attracting more casual fans, who are satisfied with the quality Microsoft will be able to deliver down an internet connection. But Google's Stadia might get to those gamers, that enormous market, first. It launches in November, while it looks like xCloud won't go fully online until early next year.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Keanu Reeves and other highlights at the Xbox event Microsoft has announced that its next-generation console is set to go on sale before the end of 2020. Codenamed Project Scarlett, the firm said that the machine would be the ""biggest leap"" over a previous generation there had ever been. At the E3 games expo, Microsoft said the custom-designed processor, made by AMD, would be four times more powerful than that of the Xbox One X. It added that Halo Infinite would be among its launch titles. However, the company did not show off what the device would look like, or reveal its intended price. Halo's Master Chief guarantees the forthcoming console at least one high-profile launch title The announcement follows similar promisesmade by Sony about the forthcoming PlayStation 5, which is also still in development. ""As expected, with a next-generation Xbox release being at least 17 months away, a full reveal didn't happen,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy IHS Markit. ""Sony had done a similar reveal of next-generation power at a previous investor event, but Microsoft's exposure at E3 and the announcement that Halo Infinite will be a launch title will have positioned it strongly, especially with the US audience."" This was one of the few images that showed what a next-generation game might look like Other details shared about the Xbox One successor included that it will: allow games to be played at up to 120 frames per second support 8K-resolution playback, although it was not clear if this would be limited to video-streaming, or include games as well allow real-time hardware-accelerated ray tracing to create more realistic lighting effects contain a solid-state drive, which will help reduce load times Microsoft teased images of Project Scarlett's circuitry being tested but did not disclose what the machine's case might look like Xbox chief Phil Spencer also strongly hinted that the machine was being designed to take advantage of new internet capabilities, but did not provide specifics. ""When we talk about Xbox in the cloud, when we talk about streaming your games, Project Scarlett and all of its power and all of its performance is the foundation of our future in console and the formation of our future in cloud,"" he said. Another highlight of the Xbox's press conference was a surprise appearance by Keanu Reeves. Keanu Reeves' involvement in Cyberpunk 2077 had not been previously revealed The actor strode on stage to reveal that Cyberpunk 2077 is set to go on sale in April 2020. The future-set role-playing game is being developed by CD Projekt Red, the studio behind the Witcher series. Reeves - who has starred in the Matrix trilogy amongst other sci-fi movies - will also appear in the title. His brief appearance drew huge applause with one attendee shouting: ""You're breathtaking."" ""No, you're breathtaking,"" the actor ad-libbed in reply to laughs from the crowd. The role of Keanu Reeves' character in the game remains a mystery Reeves' involvement guarantees positive publicity for Poland's CD Projekt, which had faced criticism forreportedly putting its team under pressure,externalto do ""extensive overtime"" to have Cyberpunk 2077 ready to demo at E3.

Microsoft showed off about 60 titles in total at its show. Other games included: Elden Ring - a fantasy title created in collaboration between Game of Thrones author George RR Martin and Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki Minecraft Dungeons - a four-play co-operative adventure spin-off from the original block-building game Blair Witch - a ""found footage"" horror title based on the 1999 film The Outer Worlds - a planet-hopping first-person role-playing game a Lego-themed expansion to Microsoft's Forza 4 race-driving title The trailer for Elden Ring feature a severed arm and several characters suffering from crumbling bodies Microsoft also announced that it has launched Xbox Game Pass PC - a subscription service that will allow console titles to be download and played on Windows 10 computers. It said 100 games will be included, including Forza Horizon 4, Metro Exodus and the Halo Master Chief Collection. It will charge $9.99 (Â£7.85) a month to be a member, and users can combine it with an Xbox Live Game Pass Console - which lets games be played on the Xbox One - for $14.99. The firm is also planning to launch a ""beta"" test version of a separate service - xCloud - in October. It will stream Xbox One games from either the firm's data centres or users' own consoles to other devices, including smartphones, allowing gamers to continuing playing when away from home. Microsoft said attendees at E3 would be offered the first public hands-on demonstrations of the technology. Microsoft's Forza 4 video game will get a Lego-themed expansion later this week It should offer a similar experience to Sony's Remote Play, but some attendees were expecting more information to have been disclosed. ""Less details about the service were forthcoming than perhaps expected, calling the idea that it will launch in 2019 into question,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. Microsoft's move comes ahead of the launch of a rival games-streaming service from Google called Stadia. The search giantplans to begin streaming titles in ultra-high definition 4K from November. Amazon is also rumoured to be working on a cloud-based platform of its own. Microsoft hopes existing Xbox Live members will upgrade to stream Xbox games on PCs ""The fact everyone is moving into the streaming space is an indication that everyone is on the right track to where the gaming space is moving to,"" Russ Frushtick, co-founder of games news site Polygon told the BBC. ""The benefit for Microsoft is a subscription model. You can pay [a monthly fee] and then you can stream it to a [low-spec] laptop."" Microsoft is the only one of the big three console-makers holding a press conference at the Los Angeles expo this year. Blair Witch's trailer contained video cam footage in a similar manner to the low-budget film The Blair Witch Project on which it is based Sony has opted to skip the event outright. Nintendo will rely on a pre-recorded video presentation - as it has done since 2013 - but will host a showroom booth where it will demo new games. The Nintendo Direct event is scheduled for 0900 local time (1700 BST) on Tuesday, the same day E3 formally opens its doors. Who knows what Microsoft's business strategy with gaming is? I certainly don't after watching that - but then maybe that was the point. This is a company keeping its options open. I see it shaping up something like this: the new console will be for serious gamers, the types who demand the high-fidelity, premium experience. The type of people who are at E3, which is why the news of the new console was met with such excitement in the room. This crowd was less excited about xCloud, the streaming service, but that's likely because this will be about attracting more casual fans, who are satisfied with the quality Microsoft will be able to deliver down an internet connection. But Google's Stadia might get to those gamers, that enormous market, first. It launches in November, while it looks like xCloud won't go fully online until early next year.

"There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as ""flushable"" There are calls for Wales to consider banning non-biodegradable wet wipes and urgently fund more research into microplastics in rivers. A new report by AMs has accused ministers of ""not getting to grips with the scale of the problem"". It says new targets are needed for tackling plastic waste, similar to those in place to cut carbon emissions. The Welsh Government said it was already acting on many of the report's recommendations. Welsh Water said non-biodegradable wet wipes were causing 2,000 sewage blockages in Wales each month. After carrying out an inquiry into plastic, the assembly's climate change committee said it had been ""disappointed"" by the actions ministers had taken so far. It called for a ""comprehensive, ambitious 10-year strategy"" to be put together and implemented. ""We shouldn't wait for others and must take the lead where we can,"" the committee's chair, Labour AM Mike Hedges, said. ""The public are supportive - we must harness their energy and enthusiasm and bring forward ambitious and transformative policies."" Plastics do not biodegrade - but break down over time into smaller and smaller fragments known as micro or nano plastics. They have been found in the soil, rivers and sea - and are known to be ingested by organisms throughout the food chain. The committee said it had been shocked to be presented with research by Cardiff University which foundhalf of all insects in the Taff river system contained plastic. Steve Ormerod, who led the work, told the inquiry ""densities of plastic particles on the river bed sometimes can be as much as 0.5 million particles per square metre. Micro-plastics ""appear to be everywhere"" in the Taff river catchment, Prof Ormerod said ""That's much, much more plastic than, in fact, the living organisms present on the bed of the river."" Other recommendations include a deposit return scheme for ""the broadest variety"" of drinks containers as well as extended producer responsibility rules so that manufacturers shoulder more of the cost of dealing with their products after they have been used. It also suggests bringing in a plastic packaging tax as a financial incentive to use recycled plastics instead of new ones. While the AMs said the Welsh Government should be praised for its very high recycling rates and for being the first UK nation to put a levy on single-use shopping bags, they claimed overall progress on tackling plastic waste had been ""lacking"". A focus on reducing and reusing goods should be urged, they said - with recycling being a last resort. A deposit return scheme has yet to be implemented in Wales, despite funding being allocated, and although research had been commissioned on extended producer responsibility rules there has been no announcement yet about whether they would be brought in. ""Stakeholders are, understandably, concerned about this apparent inertia,"" the report concluded. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it was already acting on many of the recommendations, including work on a deposit return scheme and banning a range of single-use items. ""We are ambitious about tackling waste and increasing recycling and we share the public's enthusiasm to do more,"" the spokesperson said.

"The UK and South Korea have signed an outline free trade agreement (FTA) that seeks to maintain existing trade arrangements post-Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signed the deal with his South Korean counterpart Yoo Myung-hee in Seoul. The preliminary agreement marks the first post-Brexit trade deal the UK has secured in Asia. The agreement is roughly in line with the terms of the existing Korea-EU FTA. ""In so far as a (UK-S Korea) deal has been struck that's a landmark moment,"" Mouhammed Choukeir, chief investment officer at private bank Kleinwort Hambros told BBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. ""Where it's not a big deal is that actually the biggest trading bloc still needs to be negotiated - the EU and US."" Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? All you need to know about Brexit The deal would cover South Korean exports including cars and auto parts. South Korea exports mostly cars and ships to Britain, while it imports crude oil, cars and whisky. The agreement is designed to provide stability under a no-deal Brexit, with the UK due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent Tariff-free trade with South Korea is certainly worth preserving.  British goods exports to Seoul climbed sharply after the EU's deal with South Korea was implemented in 2011. Last year the UK sold about Â£6bn worth of goods there. UK goods imports from South Korea were more than Â£4bn. Among those countries with which the UK has improved access by virtue of an EU trade deal, South Korea is one of the bigger ones. There is an agreement with Switzerland, which is the biggest of this group in terms of UK exports. But there is not with Japan or Canada which are similar scale to South Korea. And of course all these countries are far smaller markets for the UK than the EU 27. Mr Fox said: ""The value of trade between the UK and Korea has more than doubled since the EU-Korea agreement was applied in 2011. ""Providing continuity in our trading relationship will allow businesses in the UK and Korea to keep trading without any additional barriers, which will help us further increase trade in the years ahead,"" ""As we face growing global economic headwinds, our strong trading relationship will be crucial in driving economic growth and supporting jobs throughout the UK and Korea."" Both countries aim to ratify the deal by the end of October, and implement it in November. ""The deal is significant as it eased uncertainties sparked by Brexit, amid the already challenging environment for exports on the escalating trade row between Washington and Beijing,"" Ms Yoo said. South Korea - Asia's fourth largest economy - is a global leader in electronics, steel and auto industry. The country's exports to the UK hit $6.36bn (Â£5.0bn) last year. The UK is South Korea's second largest trading partner among EU members, and the Asian nation's 18th largest trading partner. The UK is pushing to strike agreements with its trading partners as the Brexit deadline looms. As a member of the EU, the UK is part of 40 trade deals which the EU has with other countries. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would fall out of these deals immediately, disrupting about 11% of UK total trade. A priority for the government has been to get these countries to roll over their trade deals with the UK. So far the UK has agreed""continuity"" deals with 12 countries and regions,external, including Israel, Norway and Iceland, Switzerland and Chile.

"People arrested for viewing indecent images of children who do not have a criminal record should undertake ""life skills"" courses rather than face prosecution, according to a report. The recommendation comes fromcampaign group Justice,external, and is designed to help cope with a surge in sex offences. Justice said it was important to ""identify ways to stop sexual offending occurring in the first place"". The group's director, Andrea Coomber, called for a ""holistic approach"". That approach, she said, should include ""education, prevention and effective rehabilitation"". Justice's proposed life skills scheme for first time offenders, or those without a criminal record, would include five sessions over four months, and one follow-up session eight months later. The sessions - designed to ""educate and assist"" rather than ""shame and punish"" - would include advice on ""strategies to manage impulses"" and ""safe internet behaviour"". Child sexual abuse: 'I sometimes wonder how I managed to survive' UN 'gravely concerned' over UK child abuse But a government spokeswoman said it was already the case that some viewers of indecent material avoided prosecution. ""Those who view, but don't create or share, such images and so pose a low risk to children can already be given cautions with tough conditions attached by the police, if prosecutors agree,"" she said. ""These [conditions] require them to complete a programme to tackle the root causes of their behaviour, which helps reduce reoffending and keep the public safe."" The report, entitled Prosecuting Sexual Offences, also says internet companies should have to report to Companies House what they are doing to stop sexual offences taking place on their platforms. Some 57 recommendations are made to tackle the rise in sexual offence allegations andthe disclosure scandal, which saw rape trials collapse after vital evidence came to light at the last minute. The working party that prepared the report was chaired by Peter Rook QC, a former Old Bailey judge who presided over some of the UK's most notorious sex cases, including those ofprolific paedophile Richard Huckleand the Oxford child sex grooming ring. He said: ""We have sought to identify areas where greater efficiency can be achieved without in any way eroding fair trial. ""We found that there is substantial scope for alleviating the pressures upon the criminal justice system by improving our response to sexual offending and treatment of those it has harmed."" The recommendations also include measures to improve the treatment of complainants and vulnerable witnesses, such as dedicated hearings to assess their needs and pre-recorded evidence for all sex cases. * If you are concerned about what you are looking at online, or the online behaviour of someone you know, you can call the confidential and anonymous 'Stop It Now' helpline on 0808 1000 900 for advice, support and help to stop.

"A ""dramatic"" fall in car production and an easing of stockpiling by manufacturers meant the economy shrank in April, official figures show. The economy contracted 0.4% from the month before,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external The contraction meant growth for the three months to April slowed to 0.3%. Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit slashed UK car production in April by nearly half,the industry said last month. BMW's Mini factory in Oxford brought forward its summer maintenance shutdown to April to minimise any disruption surrounding Brexit. Other manufacturers' annual stoppages were also brought forward. The economy had seen a spurt of growth in the run-up to the proposed March date for the UK leaving the European Union, as manufacturers stockpiled parts, raw materials and goods in the anticipation of holdups at the border. After the Brexit deadline was extended to October, it suffered the reverse effects as these supply reserves were used up and fewer purchases were made. ""The hangover that's followed the UK's original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated, said Yael Selfin, chief economist at accountants KPMG UK. ""Today's figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty."" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said: ""Growth showed some weakening across the latest three months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. ""There was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK's original EU departure date has faded."" By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent If you are going to cancel a party it is always polite to give your guests as much notice as possible. After all, that could well save them the expense of buying a present, booking a baby sitter, splashing out on new clothes etc. Unfortunately Theresa May gave British industry only a few days' notice that Brexit was being postponed and it was just too late to stop carefully-honed plans swinging into operation. Many businesses feared Brexit would cause at least temporary disruption, so they had been stockpiling components and finished goods to tide them over, and they have been using those stores up rather than producing more. The car industry brought forward its annual shutdown - usually used to put in new equipment, prepare for new models and so on. As a result, car production fell off a cliff and manufacturing as a whole fell by nearly 4% in just one month. Growth may bounce back, but then Brexit is now scheduled for 31 October. How do companies plan for that? Repeat the whole operation again or not bother? Certainly the car industry won't want another shutdown, it has already had one this year and Brexit could still be delayed again. The contraction in April was far sharper than economists had expected. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest ""underlying growth is pretty sluggish"". ""With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year."" The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has estimated car production for the whole of 2019 will be about 10% down on last year. It says the market might pick up by the end of the year if there is a favourable deal between the UK and the EU, and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market. But it has said a no-deal Brexit will make the declines worse, with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""While monthly figures are always changeable, the fundamentals of our economy are strong and it has grown every year since 2010. Employment levels are at a record high and wages growing in real terms.""

Tim Schafer has become a Microsoft employee Its chief Tim Schafer was also responsible for classics including The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and Grim Fandango. Mr Schafer told the audience that he would be a team player and was even willing to work on ""Excel stuff"" - referring to Microsoft's spreadsheet software - before adding ""I was totally lying"".

Microsoft showed off about 60 titles in total at its show. Other games included: Elden Ring - a fantasy title created in collaboration between Game of Thrones author George RR Martin and Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki Minecraft Dungeons - a four-play co-operative adventure spin-off from the original block-building game Blair Witch - a ""found footage"" horror title based on the 1999 film The Outer Worlds - a planet-hopping first-person role-playing game a Lego-themed expansion to Microsoft's Forza 4 race-driving title The trailer for Elden Ring feature a severed arm and several characters suffering from crumbling bodies Microsoft also announced that it has launched Xbox Game Pass PC - a subscription service that will allow console titles to be download and played on Windows 10 computers. It said 100 games will be included, including Forza Horizon 4, Metro Exodus and the Halo Master Chief Collection. It will charge $9.99 (Â£7.85) a month to be a member, and users can combine it with an Xbox Live Game Pass Console - which lets games be played on the Xbox One - for $14.99. The firm is also planning to launch a ""beta"" test version of a separate service - xCloud - in October. It will stream Xbox One games from either the firm's data centres or users' own consoles to other devices, including smartphones, allowing gamers to continuing playing when away from home. Microsoft said attendees at E3 would be offered the first public hands-on demonstrations of the technology. Microsoft's Forza 4 video game will get a Lego-themed expansion later this week It should offer a similar experience to Sony's Remote Play, but some attendees were expecting more information to have been disclosed. ""Less details about the service were forthcoming than perhaps expected, calling the idea that it will launch in 2019 into question,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. Microsoft's move comes ahead of the launch of a rival games-streaming service from Google called Stadia. The search giantplans to begin streaming titles in ultra-high definition 4K from November. Amazon is also rumoured to be working on a cloud-based platform of its own. Microsoft hopes existing Xbox Live members will upgrade to stream Xbox games on PCs ""The fact everyone is moving into the streaming space is an indication that everyone is on the right track to where the gaming space is moving to,"" Russ Frushtick, co-founder of games news site Polygon told the BBC. ""The benefit for Microsoft is a subscription model. You can pay [a monthly fee] and then you can stream it to a [low-spec] laptop."" Microsoft is the only one of the big three console-makers holding a press conference at the Los Angeles expo this year. Blair Witch's trailer contained video cam footage in a similar manner to the low-budget film The Blair Witch Project on which it is based Sony has opted to skip the event outright. Nintendo will rely on a pre-recorded video presentation - as it has done since 2013 - but will host a showroom booth where it will demo new games. The Nintendo Direct event is scheduled for 0900 local time (1700 BST) on Tuesday, the same day E3 formally opens its doors. Who knows what Microsoft's business strategy with gaming is? I certainly don't after watching that - but then maybe that was the point. This is a company keeping its options open. I see it shaping up something like this: the new console will be for serious gamers, the types who demand the high-fidelity, premium experience. The type of people who are at E3, which is why the news of the new console was met with such excitement in the room. This crowd was less excited about xCloud, the streaming service, but that's likely because this will be about attracting more casual fans, who are satisfied with the quality Microsoft will be able to deliver down an internet connection. But Google's Stadia might get to those gamers, that enormous market, first. It launches in November, while it looks like xCloud won't go fully online until early next year. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, told me his company's experience - its been in gaming for almost two decades - will give it an edge.

"Boris Johnson wins first ballot by MPs, getting 114 votes Three contenders - Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom and Mark Harper - eliminated Jeremy Hunt comes second, followed by Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart The seven remaining candidates go through to more votes next week Jennifer Scott and Richard Morris How does Boris Johnson plan to deliver Brexit in under 100 days? We take a look at the two Conservative MPs going head-to-head to become the next prime minister. Conservative MPs have chosen the final two candidates in the race to become the next leader of their party - and, therefore, the next UK prime minister. Three MPs are knocked out in the race to succeed Theresa May, as Boris Johnson secures more than a third of votes. That's where we'll leave our live coverage for today - thanks for joining us.

Dominic Raab says leadership candidates should be able to ""hold their nerve"" in a TV debate. The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"". But he said the candidates needed to have a ""proper debate on the vision for the country"". He told the BBC: ""There are a lot of candidates with a lot to offer but we are
right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip."" Mr Raab said the last leadership contest, that saw Theresa May take power, was a ""very quick coronation"", but ""once the adrenaline of the first froth and frenzy of this contest ebbs a little bit [you can] have a proper contest on the substance and the vision"". And what would he say to anyone considering not taking part in the TV debates? ""If you can't hold your nerve and take the heat of a
leadership contest, what chance [do you have] under the glare of the light in Brussels?"" Press Association photographer tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, we suggested the phrase ""kicking the can"" - used by Boris Johnson to warn against delaying Brexit and heard frequently thereafter - had its origins in the US. But the earliest written example of a similar phrase quoted in the Oxford English Dictionary is ""kick the tinnie"", which is described as a game played by children in Orkney.

Theresa May and Jo Brand In other news, Prime Minister Theresa May has weighed into a row about Jo Brand. The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress. It soon came to the attention of journalists and well, the rest is history... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael Gove has posted a video on Twitter, celebrating getting through the first round of the Tory leadership contest. The environment secretary came third with 37 votes, behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. But now he is looking forward to a ""proper"" debate ""about ideas"", he said. âI believe I have policies that can transform this country for
the better,"" Mr Gove added. ""Iâve got the experience of delivery that can make sure that we have a brighter future, and
Iâve got the range of support to enable all of us in this country to come together. âIâm ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead.â BBC Radio 5 Live Former Conservative Party
chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Northern Ireland's private sector output has dropped for the third month in a row, research from Ulster Bank suggests. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. May saw a fall in new business orders, staffing levels and overall output. Unlike in previous months, there was a fall in output of all four sectors of the economy. This is the first time that this has happened in six years. Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said: ""It's not just manufacturing that is weakening; all four sectors saw falling output for the first time in six years."" ""Construction firms have now reported falling orders for nine successive months and retailers have been reporting falling sales every month in 2019 to date."" Mr Ramsey said the global slowdown which had been impacting other economies was now clearly evident in Northern Ireland. ""Brexit stockpiling by manufacturing companies had been inflating the performance of local firms in recent months,"" he said. ""Now that the rapid phase of stockpiling activity has passed, the latest PMI (purchasing managers' index) data reflects the reality of current demand."" But the survey suggests expectations about the year ahead have improved, firms expect output to have risen in a year's time. Mr Ramsey said: ""Whilst firms expect challenges in the short-term - citing Brexit as one of the key factors - their expectations for the longer-term are marginally better.""

"The rig was being towed out to sea in the Cromarty Firth when it was boarded Two environmental campaigners have boarded an oil rig as it was being towed out to sea in the Cromarty Firth. Greenpeace activists said they scaled the Transocean rig Paul B Loyd Junior, contracted to BP,  on Sunday evening. They are calling for BP to end drilling for new oil wells. BP said it shared the protesters' concerns about climate change and was ""working every day to advance to a low carbon future"". But it warned:  ""While we recognise the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk."" Greenpeace said the 27,000-tonne rig owned by Transocean was on its way to the Vorlich field to drill new oil wells operated by BP. One of those on board the rig, an activist named Jo, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme what she hoped to achieve. She said: ""We are in a climate emergency. This rig is going out to the Vorlich oil field to drill a new hole which will extract 30 million barrels of oil, they hope, when we already cannot afford to burn the oil we've already got in production - it seems a bit foolish so we've come up here to try to stop the rig going out."" She said they intended to stay on board as long as they can but conceded they would only be able to delay the rig's journey for a few days. ""But it's sending a message to these companies and it's also raising awareness with other people. We have to send a message to these companies that it's just not acceptable,"" she said. BP said it was working with the rig owner Transocean and the authorities to try to resolve the situation. Police Scotland said it was working with the operators, Cromarty Firth Port Authority and others in an effort to resolve the situation as ""safely as possible"". The Cromarty Firth is a sheltered area of sea, north of Inverness, used for parking oil and gas rigs and platforms when not in use, or when they are undergoing refurbishment.

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.
