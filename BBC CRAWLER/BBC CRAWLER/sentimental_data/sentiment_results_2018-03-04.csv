"The deadly 14 February shooting has renewed calls for gun control in the US A convicted school shooter has praised the survivors of last month's attack in Parkland, Florida, for their efforts in support of gun controls in the US. Jon Romano, then 16, entered his New York high school in 2004 with a pump-action shotgun, but was disarmed by his principal before he could kill anyone. In a letter to a local newspaper sent from prison, Romano labelled the students ""courageous and inspiring"". Since the shooting, many of the survivors have lobbied for change. After 17 were killed at their school, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have publicly lobbied lawmakers for policy change.They have organised a march on Washington that will take place later this month. One teacher was injured when Jon Romano opened fire on 9 Feb 2004 at Columbia High School in Greenbush, New York. He was convicted of attempted murder and reckless endangerment after the incident. Four key dates that shaped the US gun debate One mother, two school shootings #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control US students say 'Never Again' after Florida Romano, now 30, was responding to an interview in the Times Union newspaper with his former principal, John Sawchuk.

In the piece, Mr Sawchuk had said that he believed that ""a lot of people would have been dead"" if Romano had an AR-15,externalor another semi-automatic weapon on the day of the shooting. That weapon has been used in several high profile US mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School and in the Florida school attack. Gun control advocates are calling for outlawing assault-style rifles from commercial sale.

""I believe the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland are courageous and inspiring for demanding action from politicians,"" Romano wrote. Is it time for US teachers to be armed? Why are mass shootings getting more deadly? Student survivors from the school have already lobbied at the state capital in Tallahassee In the aftermath of the 14 February shooting, pressure has mounted on US politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms including Hertz car rental, United airlines and Delta airlines have ended discounts to NRA members. The organisation has said it will not back any gun ban, and has blamed the failure of authorities to intervene and not the availability of weapons for the shooting. President Donald Trump has come out in support of some limited control measures, and accused lawmakers of being ""petrified"" of lobbyists.

"This video can not be played A quick guide to the films up for best picture at the Oscars 2018 The Oscars are taking place later, in the shadow of the sexual assault scandal that has rocked the industry in recent months. Hollywood's biggest stars will gather on Sunday evening at the Dolby Theatre for the 90th Academy Awards. But a spotlight will be shone too on the issues that have transformed the film world, symbolised by the Time's Up movement. The Shape of Water leads the fieldwith 13 nominations. Kimmel (right) was given credit for his handling of the La La Land and Moonlight mix up last year Jimmy Kimmel is taking onhosting dutiesfor the second year in a row, having coped admirably with the envelope mix-up that saw La La Land accidentally named best picture last year instead of Moonlight. He's expected to address politics during the show but there's bound to be room for a couple of jokes at the expense of his A-list friends like Matt Damon. The chat show host also hasn't ruled out a return to the stage for Warren Beatty, who was the best picture presenter - alongside Faye Dunaway - last year. However, Kimmel has already told ABC he won't reference Me Too and Time's Up because he doesn't want the show to be about ""reliving people's sexual assaults"". But it may be that Time's Up dominates the conversation both on the red carpet and in the winners' speeches anyway, with Hollywood having seen a seismic shift. Mudbound's Mary J Blige will be performing at the ceremony and is also up for best supporting actress. During the show there will be performances from each best song nominee, including Sufjan Stevens, Common and Mudbound's Mary J Blige - who, as well as singing on the soundtrack, is also up for best supporting actress. Guillermo del Toro is tipped to take the best director prize for the otherworldly romance, starring British actress Sally Hawkins as a mute janitor who falls in love with an amphibious man. 11 things we spotted in the Oscars class photo Who'll win best foreign language Oscar? Oscars 2018: The nominees in full Which Oscars films should I bother seeing? Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is highly tipped to take home the night's top prize - best picture. Others nominees include Get Out, the horror film starring Skins' actor Daniel Kaluuya, and Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk, featuring Harry Styles's debut acting role. Kaluuya goes up against Gary Oldman for best actor. Kaluuya is also nominated in the best actor category - against fellow Brit Gary Oldman, for his transformation into wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Lesley Manville is nominated for best supporting actress for Phantom Thread, with other British nominees including costume designer Jacqueline Durran and cinematographer Roger Deakins. Three Billboards' lead Frances McDormand, who stars as a grieving mother determined to avenge her teenage daughter's brutal death, is widely expected to be named best actress. She's already won that accolade at the Golden Globes and the Baftas. However, she faces competition from three-time winner Meryl Streep for The Post, as well as Saoirse Ronan for her role in Lady Bird as Christine, a teenager on the cusp of adulthood. Could Allison Janney win best supporting actress for LaVona Golden in I, Tonya? The best supporting actress Oscar seems sewn up, thanks to Allison Janney's portrayal of skating champion Tonya Harding's cold-as-ice mother. The West Wing startold the BBCshe found playing the part of the embittered, uncaring LaVona Golden to be ""liberating"". Laurie Metcalf has been praised too though, for her realistic portrayal of Lady Bird's mother. The film is Greta Gerwig's first as director and has seen her become only the fifth woman to be nominated for best director. Outside of the acting awards, there are British contenders in the best short film category, with Rachel Shenton nominated for The Silent Child. And British animation company Magic Light Pictures is up for best animated short for Revolting Rhymes. Three Billboards triumphed at the Baftas with five awards. In the best animation race, Coco - DisneyPixar's film set in Mexico on Day of the Dead - is expected to take home the prize. The best foreign picture is seen as a two-horse race, between The Square and Loveless. After the ceremony, stars will flock to the Governor's Ball - with the lucky few clutching Oscars able to get them engraved there - or other parties including the star-studded one hosted by Vanity Fair. This year, it seems there'll be much more to talk about at the after parties other than just envelopes.

"Michael Sheen said people must ensure that the campaign ""doesn't just remain a moment"" Actor Michael Sheen has said he would ""absolutely"" take a pay cut if it meant being paid the same as an actress. Speaking at a March4Women event in London, he said it was ""absolutely imperative"" that people were ""paid the same for doing the same work"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among those attending Care International's march promoting gender equality. It also marked the 100th anniversary of some women getting the vote. Mr Sheen's comments also come ahead of the 90th Academy Awards,in Los Angeles, where female campaigns #MeToo and #TimesUp are expected to feature prominently. In October 2017 the New York Times reported allegationsthat film producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed several actresses, including Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him. Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted her support to those on Sunday's march, quotingConservative MP Ken Clarke's descriptionof her as 'a bloody difficult woman'. Allow Twitter content?

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south. The centre-left coalition, dominated by the Democratic Party, was punished in traditional strongholds including Emilia-Romagna, the northern region home to the city of Bologna. Voter turnout was estimated at 73% on Monday morning, according to interior ministry figures. Though no party will be able to rule alone based on latest results, the surge of support for populist parties has been compared with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. The right-wing alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy, is tipped to get 248-268 seats - below the 316 needed for a majority. But Five Star will emerge as the largest single party in Italy's lower house, with 216-236 seats. The party was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian election: Its economy in charts Immigration dominates Italian election Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Italian voters appear to have abandoned Mr Renzi's Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is projected to come a distant third, with an estimated 107-127 seats. Immigration and the economy have been two of the key issues for voters during the election. More than 600,000 migrants have travelled from Libya to reach Italy since 2013, which has upset many Italians. The state of the economy was also at the centre of the debates. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate, the upper house of parliament, also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was forecast to take the most seats - around 102-122 - but miss out on a majority. The right-wing coalition is predicted to get 118-150 seats in the upper house, and the Democratic Party 42-54. By James Reynolds BBC News, Milan We still don't know who the winner will be. But in this opening act, Five Star has gained a certain advantage. Its message clearly resonated with young people searching for jobs, and with voters in the poorer south of the country. Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party is among the losers in this election The movement made a big point of running alone in this election. By contrast, other major parties teamed up into electoral alliances. But the feature which gave the party its strength - its independence - may now become its weakness. In order to form a government, Five Star must find coalition partners. Its inexperience in working with others may be a disadvantage in the practical business of coalition-building. So, which way will Five Star seek to turn? There is some speculation that the movement may seek a coalition with the League. Both parties have criticised Italy's relationship with the European Union, although neither campaigns to leave the bloc. A potential alliance between the two would be viewed with some degree of worry in Brussels. The vote comes as a blow to Silvio Berlusconi, 81, whose party led the right-wing coalition. But now Matteo Salvini has laid claim to that role. He has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and spoken of the ""danger"" of Islam. ""My first words: THANK YOU,"" tweeted Mr Salvini as projections rolled in. In any case Mr Berlusconi cannot hold public office himself until next year because of a tax fraud conviction. This video can not be played From 2018: Berlusconi's handshake advice for BBC reporter The leader of the League is a proud Eurosceptic, who has praised Brexit and voiced opposition to the euro in the past. ""It's a fantastic victory which fills us with pride,"" said Mr Salvini on Monday as results came in. He claimed Italian voters had ""made a step forward to be free from the cages and ties that are bringing back hunger and insecurity in Europe"". In the same speech, Mr Salvini repeated his stance that the euro is bad for Italy. ""It's a wrong currency and a wrong choice,"" he said.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Roger Bannister, who has died at the age of 88, was the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. Sir Roger, who was knighted in 1975, had been suffering from Parkinson's disease since 2011. The record time in Oxford established him as one of the great names of British athletics. In an age of the gentleman amateur, Bannister saw his running as something to be done in his spare time. He once wrote that the ideal athlete was one who enjoyed a few drinks and even the odd cigarette. Roger Gilbert Bannister was born on 23 March 1929 in Harrow, Middlesex. After leaving University College School in London, he went to Oxford to read medicine before going on to St Mary's Hospital Medical School. Bannister used his medical knowledge to devise his own training regime and investigate the mechanical aspects of running. Bannister (2nd right) warming up for his record-breaking run He had taken up athletics while at Oxford but his studies meant he could snatch only about 30 minutes a day to practise his technique on the track. Unlike the lucrative profession it has become today, athletics was always only one aspect of Bannister's student life. ""As soon as I ceased to be a student,"" he said, ""I always knew I would stop being an athlete."" Nevertheless, after just three sessions, he was running a mile in 4:24, which was enough to see him considered as a possible for the 1948 Olympics in London. Four years later he was selected for the British Olympic team to compete in Helsinki. Despite being concerned at a lack of fitness, he finished fourth in the 1500m final, setting a new British record. By the spring of 1954, Bannister was continuing his training preparations for the Commonwealth Games, with one eye on the world record and the other on his arch-rival, Australian John Landy. Bannister holding his BBC Sportsman of the Year trophy with Sportswoman winner Pat Smythe Bannister took to the track at Iffley Road, Oxford, on 6 May, a day beset by unfavourable weather. The race was almost cancelled but eventually the starting gun went off. Snooker star feeds homeless man in snow Paramedic attacked in 'parking row' Passengers jump on to tracks at Lewisham Helped by his pacemakers Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway, Bannister broke the tape in a time of 3:59.4 and history was made. When timekeeper Norris McWhirter tried to announce the time of ""Three..."", the rest of his words were drowned out by cheers. Only when he read the newspapers the following day, did Bannister fully appreciate the scale of his success. ""It had become rather like Everest, a challenge for the human spirit,"" Bannister reflected on the significance of his own achievement. His record lasted just 46 days. John Landy ran 3:57.4 in Finland to set up a much-anticipated clash between the two men in the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. In a race billed as The Miracle Mile, Landy led until the final bend when he made the mistake of looking back for his rival. Bannister burst through to breast the tape in 3:58.8. Bannister presents the 2012 Sports Personality of the Year team award to Victoria Pendleton However, the achievements on the track paled into insignificance for him when he finally fulfilled his ambition and qualified as a doctor. ""You don't have to make the rest of your life boring to be a good runner,"" he said. Within 10 years, he was established in his profession as a consultant physician, going on to become a leading neurologist, and later the Master of Pembroke College, Oxford. Although a motoring accident later caused a broken ankle that put paid to Bannister's leisure running, he forever associated himself with the sport. He became the first chairman of the Sports Council in 1971 and, during his tenure, he led a crusade on drug-testing in athletics. He was knighted in 1975 and made a Companion of Honour in the 2017 New Year's Honours. For Bannister, the challenge of the four-minute mile was only ever a psychological barrier, not a physical one and he always maintained that his achievements as a neurologist far outshone his time on the track. But for most, the image of Bannister will forever be the long-limbed athlete, with his head thrown back, breaking the tape on a blustery May evening in 1954.

"Italians are choosing a new parliament on 4 March. Who is standing, what are they proposing and does the outcome matter? Here's a brief guide. Italy has been run by a caretaker cabinet since December 2016, when Matteo Renzi resigned after staking his leadership on a referendum to overhaul the election and functioning of the houses of parliament. The search for a new prime minister involves some familiar names - and some very familiar faces, indeed. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 81, is back and leading his centre-right Forza Italia (FI) with unbounded energy. This video can not be played From 2018: Berlusconi's handshake advice for BBC reporter He has teamed up with Matteo Salvini, 44, of the right-wing, Eurosceptic Lega (League - formerly the Northern League). Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's perpetual powerbroker On the centre-left is Mr Renzi, 43, leader of the Democratic Party (PD), and challenging both camps is the leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) Luigi Di Maio, who, at 31, would be Europe's youngest prime minister if he prevailed. Migration: Like elsewhere in Europe, the arrival of migrants has spawned extremism, and even mainstream politicians have hardened their rhetoric. Mr Berlusconi, for instance, has spoken of ""a time bomb"". He wants to deport some 600,000 illegal migrants. His coalition ally, Mr Salvini, is more than pleased. He told an election rally Italy was ""a racist country"". The Five Star Movement wants changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which refugees typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach. And the PD wants to cut aid to countries that refuse to accept migrants. Italian town at centre of bitter race debate 'White race' remark sparks row in Italy Migrants were targeted by an Italian gunman this month in a racist attack Economy: Italy has experienced a sharp decline since the financial crisis of 2007-08.It has returned to sluggish growth,external, but unemployment is the third-highest in the eurozone at 11% and Italy has the second-worst debt burden after Greece. Young Italians complain of lack of opportunities worsened by an entrenched system of favours and cronyism and, consequently, seek work abroad. Observers say they have heard more about pensioners than the youth during the campaign - and the reason may be young voters' high vote abstention rates. Europe: Contenders have lined up to blame EU budget rules for hampering recovery. Five Star and the League had promised to hold a referendum to leave the euro. But that rhetoric has now been dropped. Vaccines: The Five Star Movement wants to scrap a law on compulsory vaccination, despiteevidence of a resurgence of measles. Read more:Italy makes child vaccinations compulsory The vote is for 630 members of the lower chamber (Camera dei Deputati), and 315 in the Senate Some are elected in constituencies directly, the others picked from set party lists You need to be 18 to vote for the lower chamber, 25 for the Senate. Italians overseas have their own constituencies Voting times are 07:00-23:00 (06:00-22:00 GMT). Exit polls are expected soon afterwards, with final results the following day It is the first election under a new electoral law which encourages parties to form pre-election coalitions. Five Star has refused to join forces and Mr Di Maio's chances of becoming prime minister appear distant, even though his party may well come top in the share of the vote. Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini - top row - lead the race; Matteo Renzi hopes the centre-left will win and Luigi Di Maio wants them all out The centre-right coalition is likely to emerge the overall winner - but short of a majority. Mr Berlusconi is barred from running because of a criminal conviction. He has mooted the possibility of Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, becoming prime minister. Likewise, the centre-left is unlikely to receive a majority. Mr Renzi has refused to say whether he will be the coalition's choice for PM, whilst refusing to support the incumbent at the same time. So a grand coalition bringing the centre-right and centre-left together remains a possibility. A combination of the PD and Five Star will also cross the 50% threshold, but Mr Renzi has ruled out coalitions with ""extremists"". Yes - and no, for the time being. Italy changes governments very often. However, a semblance of stability has been reigning in the past two decades, and Italians are getting used to regular voting intervals. After Brexit, Italy will be the EU's third largest economy and its strength matters beyond its borders. After all, Greece's bailout quagmire haunts Europe. An unstable government in Italy will mean little or no growth - and a continued brain drain. Is Italy likely to leave the eurozone? No, that issue has gone for the time being. It could be revived should the Eurosceptics of the League and the Five Star Movement somehow form a cabinet. A final passing thought: Russia. Nato and the EU have not failed to notice that Mr Berlusconi remains close to President Vladimir Putin. The League is also pro-Russia, as is M5S. Observers are wondering how a potential coalition of pro-Russia parties would affect EU consensus in, say, issues like sanctions against Russia over its alleged involvement in Ukraine.

"Casa Pound supporters attend a remembrance service in Milan Standing opposite an arch commemorating Italy's liberation from fascism at the end of the World War Two, a group of men dressed in black are huddled beneath a gazebo. They're supporters of Casa Pound - a fringe political party that claims to be inspired by the poet Ezra Pound. Massimo Trefiletti proudly proclaims himself and his party as fascists. The irony of standing opposite a monument to their defeat doesn't escape him. Mr Trefiletti says 25 April 1945 isn't a day of national pride but of loss. As for the future, he wants Italy to turn its back on the EU, close its borders and deport all the immigrants. Casa Pound is supported by a tiny minority of Italians but its nationalist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is being echoed by other parties in the run-up to the country's general election on 4 March. About 600,000 people have made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean and landed on Italian shores in the past four years. Now, Italian politicians of all stripes are competing to show they will be tough on these new and increasingly unwelcome arrivals. Immigrants wait for a ferry in Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island near North Africa If the polls are to be believed - and they are being treated with caution, as Italy's election is being held under a new voting system - the centre-right coalition, led by Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, is in the lead. Mr Berlusconi has described the illegal migrants living in Italy as a ""social time-bomb ready to explode"", and has pledged mass deportations. League, formerly known as the Northern League, is the other main member of that coalition. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, is a friend of France's far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen and an admirer of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. His slogan is ""Italians first"". In the party's sprawling regional headquarters in Milan, I meet Paolo Grimoldi, a League deputy who is running for another term in parliament. In his smoke-filled office, he tells me Italy should be able to choose who can come and live here. Matteo Salvini addressing a League rally in Milan ""It's better to take immigrants from Ukraine... they are Christians, or from Belarus, they are not Muslims and they cannot be terrorists. I want to have the right to make choices. I think in this moment, we don't need immigrants."" Mr Grimoldi supports the efforts of French and Austrian police to send back to Italy illegal migrants who try to cross the border. ""Our government chose to take illegal immigrants - this is the reason why France is checking on the border... if you take an airplane from London to Moscow or Ankara they will ask to see your documents... I think it should be normal."" Migrants afloat in the Mediterranean wait to be rescued by Italian authorities About 20 minutes away, on the other side of Milan, a group of teenage boys plays table tennis. They are migrants, many of whom arrived in Italy as unaccompanied minors. They wait for an English lesson to start at a centre run by Save the Children. Jawad is 17. His family is in Morocco. He chews gum and giggles nervously as he explains how he came to Italy alone. He wants a better life and isn't deterred by the idea of a hostile Italian public. ""I know that some people here are xenophobic... Some believe that diversity is good for Italy but others see us as a threat. I cannot change the way people think."" And judging by the stance of the main political parties, the election rivals believe most Italians see the migrants as a threat. Polls suggest the anti-establishment Five Star Movement may be the single most popular party among voters. It is Eurosceptic and it, too, takes a hard line on the migrant issue and puts the blame on the EU. Manlio Di Stefano, a party deputy, says: ""[Those] who come here, need to be integrated in a real way. We are taking money just to be the open port of the European Union, that's not fair."" Casa Pound protesters carry a banner demanding the closure of a mosque in Rome The number of people arriving on Italian shores has dropped dramatically - in part due to an EU policy, led by Italy, of helping the Libyan authorities to intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and return them to detention centres in Libya. The policy has been criticised by the UN as inhumane. This has happened under the current government, led by the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). But Lia Quartapelle, a deputy for the PD, says it is the best solution. ""Asking the Libyan authorities to take care of their borders is THE way to tackle illegal flows and to stop the smugglers,"" she says. She argues that aid workers and international reporters have only been able to investigate the conditions because of the agreement. But as the incumbent, the challenge for the PD is to counter or match the tough anti-immigrant rhetoric of the parties on the right. The outcome of the election is unpredictable. But it is certain that politics in Italy, as in much of the EU, is being reshaped by migration. How is migrant crisis dividing EU countries?

"This video can not be played Simon Coveney: The UK's proposals for the Irish border are a ""starting point... as opposed to an end point"" The EU is unlikely to accept the UK's latest proposal for avoiding a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland after Brexit, the Irish government has said. Theresa May has said 80% of firms would face no new customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and others would be simplified. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was not sure it would adequately protect the EU's market. The proposal, he said, was a ""starting point"" for talks not a solution. The British prime minister has ruled out the return of physical infrastructure on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, insisting that this commitment was ""absolutely clear"". But Dublin and Brussels remain to be convinced that this can be avoided after the UK leaves the EU's customs union, unless Northern Ireland continues to abide by its rules and those of the single market. May urges EU to embrace 'ambitious' Brexit Reality Check: What does the EU Brexit draft reveal? Johnson says NI border row being exploited The ""backstop"" option agreed by the two sides in December is for Northern Ireland to remain fully aligned with the rules of the customs union - which eliminates tariffs between its members - and the single market, in areas of existing North-South co-operation. This is unacceptable to the Democratic Unionist Party, which Theresa May relies on for votes in the House of Commons, and to many Conservatives MPs who say it would create a new border in the Irish Sea and amount to Northern Ireland being ""annexed"". But Mr Coveney told the BBC's Andrew Marr show this remained the default outcome unless both sides could agree other workable solutions to keep goods and people crossing over a ""largely invisible"" border. ""Our responsibility is to work positively with Britain to explore solutions but if we can't agree solutions then what we have, of course, is the backstop which is a commitment by the British government to maintain full alignment with the rules of customs union and the single market,"" he said. Asked about Theresa May's proposal, in a major speech on Friday, to waive customs checks for 80% of firms doing business across the border, he said it could not be taken for granted. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Let's actually get on and start the negotiations"" ""This is the mistake that is made in Britain all the time,"" he said. ""When someone definitively says something will be the case from the British government, people assume that is the negotiated outcome. Of course it is not. ""I am not sure the EU will be able to support a situation whereby 80% of companies that trade north-south and south-north will actually protect the integrity of the EU single market,"" he said. ""While of course we will explore and look at all the proposed British solutions, they are essentially a starting point in negotiations not an end point."" he said. Mr Coveney said Dublin wanted to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland as much as London did. But he insisted that for a single market to function ""if goods move from one customs union to another there needs to be some checks"" unless some mechanism was negotiated to prevent them. In Friday's speech, Mrs May said the vast majority of north-south trade was carried out by small and medium-sized business whose economic contribution was not ""systemically significant"" to the EU market but which would be most affected by custom checks and other red tape. ""We would allow them to continue to operate as they do currently, with no new restrictions,"" she said. The DUP said the ""sensible"" idea should be the basis for negotiations currently going on in Brussels. Speaking on Sunday, Mrs May said she was pleased that Irish PM Leo Varadkar agreed to sit down alongside the European Commission and UK to look at her proposals in more detail. ""We've got proposals as to how we're going to achieve that, now we're going to be able to sit down and talk with others about how we're going to do that,"" she told Andrew Marr. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who wants the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union, said the PM was relying on ""technological solutions that perhaps do not even exist"". ""One of the most shameful features of the whole Brexit process has been the negligent way that the interests of Ireland have just been cast aside,"" she told ITV's Peston on Sunday.

"The widow of one of the troops killed later became embroiled in a row with US President Donald Trump The Islamic State (IS) group has published a video purporting to show an ambush in Niger in which four US soldiers were killed last October. It is not clear why the release of the video - via an IS outlet on messaging app Telegram - was delayed until now. The video consists mainly of raw footage, including images apparently filmed using a helmet camera belonging to one of the soldiers. The video seems to suggest that the attack was carried out by IS militants. The deaths became a major political row in the USwhen the widow of one of the soldiers, Army Sgt La David Johnson, said President Donald Trump had made her cry during a condolence phone call by suggesting her husband ""knew what he signed up for"". The president later called a US congresswoman's account of the phone call ""totally fabricated"". The propaganda film begins with still images showing an alleged pledge of allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by members of the Sahel-based group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM was formed from a number of West African jihadist groups in March 2017, and originally had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. This alleged switch to IS was reported last month by a number of analysts, but it had not been promoted by IS outlets on social media. How IS wages its social media war Apple removes Telegram from app store The graphic video shows several armed militants walking and running in a desert area, apparently heading for the ambush, reports BBC Monitoring. The soldiers are seen driving away in a white vehicle, with coloured smoke grenades providing cover. After a cut in the video, the US soldiers are seen around another vehicle, with one soldier driving and the other two walking beside while seemingly firing at their attackers. Then, one of the soldiers drops to the ground. The man wearing the helmet camera tries to raise the fallen man. How did US soldiers come under attack in Niger? More remains of US soldier found in Niger Niger country profile The soldier driving the vehicle jumps out and helps drag the soldier to cover, before he and the camera-wearer run into the scrub. While running, the soldier wearing the camera falls to the ground. The footage ends with the camera unmoving, and militants surrounding the soldier, firing at point-blank range. La David Johnson, one of the US soldiers killed in the attack The deaths in Niger sparked controversy after President Donald Trump's phone call to the widow of Sgt La David Johnson. Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who knew the soldier in question, heard the call while en route to meet his body with his family, and said the president did not seem to know his name. President Trump denied forgetting Sgt Johnson's name in the call, saying he spoke it ""without hesitation"". He said it had been a ""very nice conversation"". Allow Twitter content?

Sgt Johnson's body was initially located two days after the ambush, while the bodies of the other three soldiers were discovered on the same day they were attacked, on 4 October 2017. The US has about 800 troops in Niger, which they say are there to help train local forces and support counter-terrorism efforts. But questions have emerged about why the US troops were not more heavily armed for the failed mission. ""We should have gotten this information a long time ago,"" Texas Congressman Marc Veasey told CBS News on Sunday. ""Why they were asked to continue to go onto this mission I think is something that we all need to find out."" The Pentagon is due to release the results of their investigation into the ambush as soon as this week, CBS reports. This was the first time US troops were killed in combat in Niger.

"This video can not be played World Indoor Athletics: GB's Andrew Pozzi wins 60m hurdles gold in photo finish Great Britain's Andrew Pozzi secured men's 60m hurdles gold by one-hundredth of a second at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Birmingham. The 25-year-old has shared team captain duties with Shelayna Oskan-Clarke at the event and his win arrived shortly after she claimed women's 800m bronze. Pozzi's 7.46 seconds just edged out American Jarret Eaton (7.47). Britain won another bronze in the women's 4x400m relay after Jamaica were disqualified. The British quartet of Amy Allcock, Hannah Williams, Meghan Beesley and Zoey Clark were initially elevated from fourth to third, before being disqualified themselves for obstruction, only to be reinstated on appeal. The decision means Britain end the championships with seven medals - Pozzi and pentathlon winner Katarina Johnson-Thompson the only athletes to win gold. There was no doubt about Oskan-Clarke's podium finish as she rallied from fifth to third in the closing 200 metres while Pozzi also fought back having clattered an early hurdle. Pozzi and Eaton shook hands as they stared at the arena's big screen when waiting for clarity on who had won. Roars met the result, as the Briton took the title having come from behind late on following Eaton's rapid start, with France's Aurel Manga third (7.54). ""My heart stopped at the end there,"" Pozzi told BBC Sport. ""I knew the fifth hurdle I was behind. I can't describe how much I wanted it. ""I was throwing my body at the line. To be voted co-captain for the championships is the biggest honour of my life. Every member of the team has been perfect."" Two-time men's 110m hurdles world champion Colin Jackson on BBC Two Pozzi had a great heat, a wonderful semi-final and now, when the pressure was on, he's won. Even though he made some mistakes, he kept a cool head and hauled himself back into contention. He drove very hard for the line. What a well deserved victory. This video can not be played Shelayna Oskan-Clarke wins World Indoor bronze in 800m Oskan-Clarke, 28, summed up the grit which has epitomised several British performances as a well-timed surge in the final 50 metres of her 800m final earned her a first medal at a global championships. Her time of one minute 59.81 seconds makes her the sixth British woman to break two minutes indoors. Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba won in 1:58.31, ahead of American Ajee Wilson (1:58.99), the pair resuming their rivalry from the outdoor World Championships in 2017 where they won silver and bronze respectively in London. ""At the start it was nerve-wracking as I had to do my speech and I wanted to inspire the team,"" co-captain Oskan-Clarke told BBC Sport. ""Now it's congratulating them, making them know I'm aware of their performances and that's not too draining. ""I'm happy. It wasn't the best race. It was a bit out of control for the first part of it but I just had to dig deep and catch them at the end. ""The crowd noise was so incredible and loud. You can't not hear it and it helped me dig that bit deeper."" Women's marathon world record holder and BBC Sport commentator Paula Radcliffe Oskan-Clarke judged this perfectly. She was only just starting late on and the noise of the crowd must have given her a boost. Once you start to reel someone in and you see they are tired, it's a huge confidence boost. She didn't panic at all when the leaders went ahead. At one point it looked like she was more to the back of the field but she kept her composure. This video can not be played GB promoted to bronze, then disqualified, then get medal back The final Great Britain medal of the championships arrived amid confusing scenes as Allcock, Williams, Beesley and Clark were handed 4x400m bronze shortly before the championships ended. Jamaica, who finished second, were disqualified when an athlete waiting for the baton was ruled to have been stood in an incorrect position. BBC Sport analyst Michael Johnson said the decision was fair but moments later, Great Britain were also thrown out. That gave bronze to Ukraine until almost two hours after the final, when Britain were reinstated. It was the latest controversy in a championship which featured 21 disqualifications, most of which were for lane infringements. The American four - brought home by 400m gold medallist Courtney Okolo - were untouchable in setting a championship record, finishing half a second off the world record in three minutes 23.85 seconds. In the men's 4x400m final, Poland set a world indoor record of three minutes 01.77 seconds, edging out the USA into silver (3:01.97). Great Britain's 4x400m relay team Amy Allcock, Hannah Williams, Meghan Beesley and Zoey Clark were briefly elevated into bronze medal position Eight-time world champion Michael Johnson on BBC Two I believe the IAAF will have to do something about this. The problem will continue with lane infringements. This was on an absurd level. If you step on the line one time, you don't get much advantage. When it amounts to this number of disqualifications and confusion, I think fans get to a point where they zone out, thinking they don't know who won. That's no fun for the fans.

"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave in Syria as the situation there was described as ""beyond critical"". Syria's military appears to be advancing on several fronts as it tries to retake the enclave just to the east of the capital, Damascus. Government forces have now taken 25% of the area, UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitors say. A UN aid convoy planned for Sunday has not been able to enter the enclave. The fighting since 18 February has left more than 600 people dead, many of them children. Neither a daily five-hour truce ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor the ordering of a nationwide ceasefire by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave. The UN says that the ""collective punishment of civilians is simply unacceptable"". The organisation said it had failed to obtain permission from Syrian officials to allow 40 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies to enter the key town of Douma. More than 600 people have been killed in the past week in the Eastern Ghouta ""Instead of a much-needed reprieve, we continue to see more fighting, more death, and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed,"" UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Opposition sources and journalists on the ground say that hundreds of people have been fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa, south of Douma and on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta. The enclave is an agricultural region about the size of Manchester in the UK. Residents, many of them women and children, are reported to have fled into the centre of the enclave to seek shelter. Fighting has intensified in Beit Sawa between government forces and the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as ""beyond critical"". Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region in two. Syrian state media say the army has advanced on several fronts, and has taken control of villages and farms while attacking from the eastern side of the enclave. The Syrian observatory said regime forces were 3km (two miles) from Douma. The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a phone call on Sunday that Syria and its Russian backers bore responsibility for the ""heart-breaking human suffering"", Downing Street said. The leaders agreed that Russia must act now to persuade the Syrian government to stop the bombing.

"Michael Sheen said people must ensure that the campaign ""doesn't just remain a moment"" Actor Michael Sheen has said he would ""absolutely"" take a pay cut if it meant being paid the same as an actress. Speaking at a March4Women event in London, he said it was ""absolutely imperative"" that people were ""paid the same for doing the same work"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among those attending Care International's march promoting gender equality. It also marked the 100th anniversary of some women getting the vote. Mr Sheen's comments also come ahead of the 90th Academy Awards,in Los Angeles, where female campaigns #MeToo and #TimesUp are expected to feature prominently. In October 2017 the New York Times reported allegationsthat film producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed several actresses, including Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him.

The public was advised not to travel during the worst of the snow last week. Scottish Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he had been contacted by people who were facing disciplinary action or potential docking of wages. He told the BBC that was not acceptable and he would look at the legal position.

His comments come as icy roads and snow continue to cause disruption in parts of the UK but forecasters say temperatures are starting to rise. Weather warnings for snow and ice are in place for parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. Many rail services are still affected while three flood warnings are in place.

""Armies"" of local people have helped clear roads across Scotland, including in the village of Blanefield The west coast mainline reopened between Scotland and Carlisle on Sunday evening. ScotRail earlier said it had a ""near-normal service"" running across the country. Many rural communities in south-west England which had been cut off by poor conditions can now be reached. On Wednesday into Thursday, Scotland ground to a halt witha red weather warning in place and people told not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Yousaf said: ""I'd be extremely, extremely disappointed if employers chose to dock wages for somebody because they couldn't travel during the red weather warning.""

He added: ""Now that's just simply not an acceptable situation, when the government and the police and other agencies joined together to give very crisp, very clear advice."" Asked what action Mr Yousaf might take against employers, he responded: ""I don't know the legal position, but it will clearly be part of the debrief that we have after we pass through the yellow weather warning, which is late Monday night."" The minister said the process would involve ""talking to employers and having that dialogue with them, and internally looking at what powers we have is clearly part of the discussion we're going to have"".

Meanwhile, the Met Office currently has two yellow severe weather warnings in place, including for snow and ice across a large area of central and eastern Scotland until Monday night. A second warning for ice in parts of north-east England and Northern Ireland is in force until 11:00 GMT on Monday. The Met Office has also issued a third yellow warning of snow and ice for Tuesday covering northern Scotland. The three flood warnings are in coastal parts of south-west and north-east England and are because of high tides, rather than thawing snow. ScotRail said on Sunday morning: ""A massive thank you to everyone at the ScotRail Alliance that worked tirelessly day and night to get Scotland's railway back up and running."" Virgin Trains reopened its line between Carlisle and Scotland on the west coast main line with  limited rail services. It is also offering replacement coaches. The railways are facing a challenge to clear snow On the east coast route, Virgin said it hoped to run a ""near-normal Sunday timetable"" but passengers were urged to travel only if necessary as trains would be busy.

Many schools contacted parents via social media asking for help to clear paths and playgrounds to make them safe for pupils to return. Hundreds of thousands of children have not been in the classroom since Tuesday due to extreme weather. Parents and teachers have already been working to clean up snow from school grounds to allow them to reopen on Monday. Other schools posted appeals for volunteers to gather at specific times to get grounds cleared. Most councils who were forced to close schools last week were aiming to reopen facilities after the weekend, weather depending. The Scottish government has also openedthe Bellwin Scheme,set up to help councils who face large costs from damage due to the severe weather.

"President Kiska accused senior officials of an ""arrogance of power"" Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska has called for a radical government reshuffle or new elections to rebuild public trust after the murder of a journalist and his fiancÃ©e. But Prime Minister Robert Fico disagreed, accusing the president of ""dancing on the graves"" of the victims. The killing of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova sparked protests in Slovakia. Kuciak, 27, had been investigating alleged political corruption linked to Italian organised crime. He was shot dead before he had finished the article, but it was published posthumously. Journalistâs final story rocks Slovakia Slovakia murder suspects released All of the seven people arrested in connection with the murders were released on Saturday because no evidence had emerged during the 48 hours they could be legally detained, police said. One of the men released is an Italian who had done business deals with officials close to Mr Fico. Last week, Maria Troskova, the prime minister's chief state adviser, and Viliam Jasan, the secretary of the state security council, resigned amid allegations about past dealings with him. In a joint statement, the pair denied wrongdoing. They said they were stepping down for the duration of the investigation so their names could not be used in a political battle against Mr Fico. Jan Kuciak's funeral was held on Saturday Mr Kiska called for a ""radical reconstruction"" of the government, but Mr Fico said this would undermine the results of the 2016 elections. The president, who does not have formal powers to dissolve the government, accused senior officials of an ""arrogance of power"", and bemoaned a lack of action on the part of the government to restore public trust and defuse tensions after the killings last weekend. He said he would meet political parties to find a way out. Mr Fico said any government changes would have to be agreed by his Smer party's two coalition partners, adding: ""In this process, the constitution does not recognise any role of the president."" He added: ""Our goal is the investigation of this brutal act. We won't dance on the graves of two young people, unlike opposition, media and, now, the president."" Kuciak had been investigating the presence of the Italian mafia in eastern Slovakia The Slovak National Party, a junior government member, said it was ready to talk to the president. The other party in the coalition, Most-Hid, wants the interior minister to resign by 12 March. Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004. In his investigation, Kuciak alleged that Italian businessmen with ties to the feared Calabrian organised crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta had settled in eastern Slovakia, and spent years embezzling EU funds for this relatively poor region on the border with Ukraine.

"The shop and flat above were both destroyed in the blast A sixth man has been arrested by police investigating the shop explosion in Leicester that left five people dead. Three members of the same family died when the building on Hinckley Road was destroyed last Sunday. The arrested man, who is in his 40s and from East Anglia, was being held on suspicion of manslaughter on Sunday. Three men have been charged with manslaughter and arson with intent to endanger life.

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south. The centre-left coalition, dominated by the Democratic Party, was punished in traditional strongholds including Emilia-Romagna, the northern region home to the city of Bologna. Voter turnout was estimated at 73% on Monday morning, according to interior ministry figures. Though no party will be able to rule alone based on latest results, the surge of support for populist parties has been compared with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US. The right-wing alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy, is tipped to get 248-268 seats - below the 316 needed for a majority. But Five Star will emerge as the largest single party in Italy's lower house, with 216-236 seats. The party was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, who denounced cronyism in Italian politics. It has captured new voters in the poorer regions of southern Italy, feeding off anger over institutional corruption, economic hardship and immigration. Italian election: Its economy in charts Immigration dominates Italian election Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Italian voters appear to have abandoned Mr Renzi's Democratic Party because of dissatisfaction over these issues, and the centre-left coalition is projected to come a distant third, with an estimated 107-127 seats. Immigration and the economy have been two of the key issues for voters during the election. More than 600,000 migrants have travelled from Libya to reach Italy since 2013, which has upset many Italians. The state of the economy was also at the centre of the debates. In 2016, some 18 million people were at risk of poverty, and unemployment is currently at 11%. Results from the vote for Italy's Senate, the upper house of parliament, also favoured populists and parties of the right. Five Star performed better than anticipated and was forecast to take the most seats - around 102-122 - but miss out on a majority. The right-wing coalition is predicted to get 118-150 seats in the upper house, and the Democratic Party 42-54. By James Reynolds BBC News, Milan We still don't know who the winner will be. But in this opening act, Five Star has gained a certain advantage. Its message clearly resonated with young people searching for jobs, and with voters in the poorer south of the country. Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party is among the losers in this election The movement made a big point of running alone in this election. By contrast, other major parties teamed up into electoral alliances. But the feature which gave the party its strength - its independence - may now become its weakness. In order to form a government, Five Star must find coalition partners. Its inexperience in working with others may be a disadvantage in the practical business of coalition-building. So, which way will Five Star seek to turn? There is some speculation that the movement may seek a coalition with the League. Both parties have criticised Italy's relationship with the European Union, although neither campaigns to leave the bloc. A potential alliance between the two would be viewed with some degree of worry in Brussels. The vote comes as a blow to Silvio Berlusconi, 81, whose party led the right-wing coalition. But now Matteo Salvini has laid claim to that role. He has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and spoken of the ""danger"" of Islam. ""My first words: THANK YOU,"" tweeted Mr Salvini as projections rolled in. In any case Mr Berlusconi cannot hold public office himself until next year because of a tax fraud conviction.

"May Laidlaw pictured with her husband, Tommy Relatives of a great-grandmother who was killed by a teenager on a scrambler bike say ""something must change"". May Laidlaw, 78, was hit as she crossed a road in Liverpool in December.A 14-year-old boy was detainedafter admitting causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop. Mrs Laidlaw's family said they want police to have more powers to tackle people who use illegal scrambler bikes. A police chief said he believed some bikes were ""like a weapon"". Merseyside Police has arrested more than 100 people and seized 300 off-road bikes in its recent Operation Brookdale campaign, crushing scramblers found to be ridden illegally. Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley said the situation is improving, though some offenders are still using the bikes ""like a knife or a gun"" with an equally tragic impact. But the Laidlaw family believe more can be done. Mrs Laidlaw's daughter Heather Bush said she feels much of the responsibility lies with parents. Mrs Laidlaw's family say they have been left ""devastated"" by her death ""They're letting them go out on the road. They must know and they must be held responsible,"" she said. ""We want to show people what these kids are doing. Don't let them out on their own. Don't buy your kid a bike if you know that that they're going to do the wrong thing with them."" Mrs Laidlaw's husband Tommy said: ""If parents are buying these bikes, they should be charged as well."" Police are required to observe speed limits and take extra care when pursuing off-road riders, for fear of putting them in further danger. But Mr Laidlaw has called on police forces to explore if greater powers are needed. The 78-year-old, who was married for 58 years, said: ""They can chase them but they can't stop them. They can only follow them, so their hands are tied as much as anybody else's. They've got to change the law somehow. ""I don't know how they'll do it but they've got to do something. It's the people the riders hurt who suffer. I know they've seized a lot of the bikes, but they're still out on them."" Merseyside Police seized 300 off-road bikes in a recent campaign ACC Critchley said his officers can and will pursue offenders but ""ultimately it's down to the individual officer to make the decision, lawfully, of what is proportionate"". His force have used stinger devices to stop the bikes and helicopters to track offenders. ""We will not allow people to drive around like a pack of animals"" but ""we have to look after the safety of the public... of the individual on the bike and of our officers as well"". He said ""in the main, legislation is appropriate"" but suggested ""some changes"" could be made. ""We have licensing around areas such as firearms and I believe that whilst there is law around on-road bikes, it's too easy to be able to purchase an off-road bike that in itself is a weapon. ""On the other side, I also have concerns about protections of my officers and the law around them being able to make some really tough decisions. ""I think the law does not best protect our officers at that moment in time to make those decisions. That's something that we're talking to the National Policing League and our local MPs about."" Mrs Laidlaw's family said the great-grandmother was ""loved by so many"" Sentencing the teenager at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Clement Goldstone QC told him he was ""part of a group or club who have decided, at the age of 14, that you are above the law"". His bike, which had been bought weeks earlier for Â£150, was not roadworthy and had a flat tyre, no front or brake lights and no speedometer. The boy, who also admitted driving without insurance, had also not been wearing a helmet. Ms Bush said she feels the boy's three-year detention was ""not enough"" and that he should have been ""made an example"". ""It's just fun to them. He knew he was doing wrong. If he wanted to ride, he should've been riding in a [legal off-road] place,"" she said. ""He's ruined everything about our family. I never went a day without speaking to my mum. She only lived over the road. ""They must know that one day they're going to hurt someone, or themselves.""

"League chief Matteo Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio both want to lead Italy The leaders of two anti-establishment parties have each claimed they have the right to govern Italy, after voters in Europe's fourth-largest economy did not return a majority to any single party. The Eurosceptic, populist Five Star Movement was the biggest single party with a third of the vote. But the right-wing populist League said it had been endorsed to run the country as part of a centre-right alliance. Forming a government could take weeks of negotiation and coalition-building. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned as leader of the governing centre-left Democratic Party, which performed poorly, taking less than 20% of the vote. He said the party would not join a coalition with ""anti-system forces"" and would go into opposition instead. An alliance between the far-right League and ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is set to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, but the League has emerged as the senior partner. It won 17.4% of the vote compared with Forza Italia's 14%. What exactly is populism? Analysis: Outsiders enter the mainstream Katya Adler: Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the League, said at a press conference that he intended to speak to other parties to gain a parliamentary majority. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, announced that his party was also open to coalition talks with other parties - this despite the party having stated the contrary in the run-up to the vote. The gains for populists represent a political earthquake that will send shockwaves to the EU in Brussels, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says. A coalition between Five Star and the League would be a ""nightmare result"" for the EU, our correspondent adds. However, Mr Salvini has ruled out such an alliance. He said he was not interested in a ""minestrone"" coalition, referring to the Italian soup of mixed vegetables. Results showed that the League conquered broad swathes of Italy's north, while Five Star saw its strongest show of support in the south.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' China has warned that it does not want a trade war with the US, but will not sit idly by if its economy is hurt. Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, made the comments amid controversy over Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The US president has also threatened to impose a tax on EU-made cars, and earlier said ""trade wars are good"". US trading partners, the IMF and the WTO have strongly criticised his moves. What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. China's Zhang Yesui said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". EU trade chiefs have reportedly been considering slapping 25% tariffson around $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whisky. Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. Where Trump stands on world trade A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay. Critics say the plan could put US jobs at risk Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

"Michael Sheen said people must ensure that the campaign ""doesn't just remain a moment"" Actor Michael Sheen has said he would ""absolutely"" take a pay cut if it meant being paid the same as an actress. Speaking at a March4Women event in London, he said it was ""absolutely imperative"" that people were ""paid the same for doing the same work"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among those attending Care International's march promoting gender equality. It also marked the 100th anniversary of some women getting the vote. Mr Sheen's comments also come ahead of the 90th Academy Awards,in Los Angeles, where female campaigns #MeToo and #TimesUp are expected to feature prominently. In October 2017 the New York Times reported allegationsthat film producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed several actresses, including Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him.

"Deliveries struggled to get through the snow and ice, like here on the A1 in Northumberland The bad weather looks set to send a chill over Britain's economy, with warnings of a short-term hit to growth. The impact on sectors such as retailing and construction could halve the 0.4% GDP growth many economists had forecast for the first three months of 2018. Retail expert Phil Dorrell said the big freeze could be a ""disaster"" for the high street as people staying home turned to more shopping online. One small firms group said its members would lose Â£7,000 each on average. Economist Howard Archer, chief adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the snow's impact meant that the UK's first quarter GDP may be reduced by 0.1%, or up to 0.2% if the severe weather persists. It affected not just construction and shops but the supply chains of big business, restaurants, and the travel sector. ""There will obviously be a significant hit to UK economic activity,"" said Mr Archer, although he added that it was ""important to bear in mind that much of the lost activity will eventually be recouped"". Also, the increasing ability of people to work from home would help limit the economic damage, he said. But some sectors could be particularly vulnerable to sudden shocks.The collapse of Maplin and Toys R Usunderlines problems for the high street. Andseveral restaurant chains have run into trouble. A survey published this weekend by the CBI employers' group said that trading conditions for consumer-facing firms were still tough. Freezing temperatures in the usually bustling high street at Guildford, Surrey Mr Dorrell, managing partner of Retail Remedy, said bricks and mortar retailers will be hit hard by the sub-zero temperatures and gale-force icy winds. ""Anything that takes footfall away from shops reduces spend, and pushes spend towards the internet. ""In the short term, it's very much a disaster. If you go down to the nearest road you will see that traffic is significantly less than it was previously, so most parts of retail will be hurting at this point."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said many high streets have looked liked ghost towns over the past week. Firms ""will feel the pain of the temporary drop in trade"", said Mike Cherry, the FSB's chairman. ""Even among those which have battled on, many have been affected by customers or supplies being unable to reach them. ""The financial cost of severe weather events on small firms averages at around Â£7,000 for each affected business. ""It comes at a time when many have been affected by rises in business rates, increasing employment costs and the effects of the weak pound,"" Mr Cherry said. The Severn Bridge was barely visible as snow fell across south Wales and south-west England The hit from the weather comes amid signs that British businesses generally are showing signs of improved health, although retailing remains in the doldrums. The CBI survey suggests companies expanded at their fastest rates in more than two years in the three months to February. The CBI's monthly growth indicator - based on its surveys of how much businesses' output has changed over the previous three months - more than doubled to plus-20 in February, from plus-9 in January, reaching its highest since December 2015. Growth was far above the long-run average across most sectors except retail, the CBI said. But it forecast that conditions would remain ""challenging"" for consumer-facing companies and retailers this year.

"Mr Trump said that ""nobody does self-deprecating humour better"" than he does US President Donald Trump joked about White House ""chaos"" and poked fun at his aides and wife in a light-hearted speech at an annual dinner on Saturday. ""Nobody does self-deprecating humour better than I do,"" he told politicians and journalists in Washington DC. Mr Trump joked about his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has reportedly had his security clearance downgraded. ""We were late tonight because Jared could not get through security,"" the president said. Kushner loses top-level White House access In wide-ranging remarks at the Gridiron Dinner, he took aim at a number of targets, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr Trump has said that he would never have appointed Mr Sessions if he had known he was going to recuse himself from leading the investigation into possible Trump ties to Russia. The president joked that he had offered Mr Sessions a ride to the event, ""and he recused himself. What are you going to do?"" Mr Trump also poked fun at: Vice-President Mike Pence:""I really am proud to call him the apprentice. But lately he's showing a particularly keen interest in the news these days. He is asking 'has he been impeached yet?' I don't like that."" White House departures:""Now the question everyone keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?"" Former chief strategist Steve Bannon:""That guy leaked more than the Titanic."" The New York Times:""I'm a New York icon. You're a New York icon. And the only difference is I still own my buildings."" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un:""As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine."" He added that North Korea had ""called up a couple of days ago"" to say they would be open for talks. ""I said so would we, but you have to denuke,"" Mr Trump said. It was not clear if this was part of the joke. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump reportedly praisedChinese President Xi Jinping's bid to extend his leadershipbeyond the constitutional limit. ""He's now president for life. He was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,"" CNN quoted him as saying. China's governing Communist Party is expected to remove a clause in the constitution which limits a president to two five-year terms later this week.

"Dolly Burton has been offered a ""five-figure sum"" for a 2m strip of land, which belongs to the council A 97-year-old Bristol woman is refusing to give up a strip of her front garden needed for a new housing development. Dolly Burton lives in council housing on Shaldon Road in Lockleaze in front of a planned development of 49 homes. Bristol City Council and developers have offered her a ""five-figure sum"" for the land, which is owned by the authority, to widen access to the site. But Ms Burton, who has lived there for 50 years, said: ""They could offer me Â£100,000 and I wouldn't budge."" The authority and developers need permission to take a two-metre slice from Ms Burton's garden, to widen the development's access road so it can be adopted as a public highway. Bristol City Council and developers need permission to take two metres of Ms Burton's front garden But Ms Burton says no amount of compensation will persuade her to part with the land. ""The way they wanted it, they'd take most of the garden and it would be awful if I had no front garden,"" she said. Councillor Paul Smith, cabinet member for housing, said she was ""completely within her rights to refuse"" the offer. ""She is a council tenant, it is council-owned land, but the rules are such that the council can't take away part of somebody's tenancy without their agreement,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' China has warned that it does not want a trade war with the US, but will not sit idly by if its economy is hurt. Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, made the comments amid controversy over Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The US president has also threatened to impose a tax on EU-made cars, and earlier said ""trade wars are good"". US trading partners, the IMF and the WTO have strongly criticised his moves. What would China do in a US trade war? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it. On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. China's Zhang Yesui said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (Â£420bn) last year. But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". EU trade chiefs have reportedly been considering slapping 25% tariffson around $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whisky. Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. Where Trump stands on world trade A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay. Critics say the plan could put US jobs at risk Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"". Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern. But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling. The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

A great day for Pep Guardiola and Chris Hughton but plenty to ponder for Arsene Wenger and Antonio Conte. Until next time, cheerio! Man City 1-0 Chelsea Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola speaking to Sky Sports:""Chelsea are still champions. They played with 10 players behind the ball but we didn't concede one chance. We created enough to win the game, score more goals. Our high pressing was outstanding so we are so happy because it's another step forward to be champions. We have 76 points. ""We had to be careful against the counter attacks, Hazard, Willian and Pedro are all quick players but we controlled it and we were quick with the ball, nobody was making extra passes or extra touches. It's not easy when they defend with nine players in their box. ""We are close but it is not already done. It's in our hands. Now we start again, we have to try to stay calm.

Points scoring against the boardâs âtightâ transfer policy doesnât work when they see Â£80m of strike talent sat on the bench. Poor tactics and too slow to change. Again. Man City 1-0 Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to Sky Sports: ""In this moment it is very difficult to play against Manchester City. They are a really strong team with fantastic quality. We tried. It's a pity for the goal we conceded after 30 seconds of the second half, that changed the game. My tactics were to not concede space between the lines, if you do that you risk losing by many goals. ""They have a fantastic mentality when they lose the ball, they want to run and press and are a really strong team."" Were Chelsea adventurous enough? ""Do you think this? If you give City space behind us the game can finish not 1-0. It's not good enough but this is the truth, I don't think this is because of the tactics. ""It's not simple to play against Man City. They have great intensity of every moment of the game we tried to do this and defend well but we conceded a goal after 30 seconds of the second half and it's very difficult to come back from that but don't forget we were missing N'Golo Kante who is a crucial player for our balance."" Man City 1-0 Chelsea Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Sport:""The effort was an important effort by the players but despite this we conceded a goal after 30 seconds in the second half and after that it was difficult to come back. ""We played against a team with fantastic quality. They have a great mentality and we must give the best compliment for Manchester City. ""When you play against City you have to try not to concede space between the lines and space on the pitch because they are incredible on the ball. If we did not concede a goal after 30 seconds maybe it could have been more simple. Tactics?""We tried to have patience. When you are 1-0 down you can always have the possibility to score. When you concede the space to Manchester City there is the risk for the game to finish 3 or 4-0. ""When you play against a team that has shown to be stronger than you for a lot of the season - because 25 points is a big difference - you have to think with your brain and not your head because otherwise you finish with a bad loss and that's not good for the players."" #bbcfootball or text on 81111 (UK only) Peter:It is very obvious that Conte's heart is no longer in@CFC,external.

We need four victories to be champions, it is in our hands and if our behavior is like today we will be champions.

Man City 1-0 Chelsea Manchester City are 18 points clear at the top of the table and need just four wins from their nine remaining games to seal the Premier League title. Pep Guardiola is smiling from ear-to-ear. He's delighted with that win and probably a little surprised how comfortable Chelsea made it for his side.

Man City 1-0 Chelsea A couple of Chelsea fans have taken off their shirts and have turned their back on the pitch to start chanting to their fellow supporters - looks like they are making their own entertainment.

Gideon:Can't wait for Man City to meet Liverpool in the CL. Seems to me like only Jurgen Klopp can beat Man City. Man City 1-0 Chelsea Into the first of four minutes added on at the end of normal time and Chelsea are definitely being a bit more adventurous.

He replaces Eden Hazard with a minute plus stoppage time to make an impact. Man City 1-0 Chelsea Simon StoneBBC Sport at the Etihad Stadium Alvaro Morata was ready to come on, then stepped away from the touchline, put his coat on and is now warming up by the dug-out.

"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave in Syria as the situation there was described as ""beyond critical"". Syria's military appears to be advancing on several fronts as it tries to retake the enclave just to the east of the capital, Damascus. Government forces have now taken 25% of the area, UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitors say. A UN aid convoy planned for Sunday has not been able to enter the enclave. The fighting since 18 February has left more than 600 people dead, many of them children. Neither a daily five-hour truce ordered by the Russians - Syria's main backers - nor the ordering of a nationwide ceasefire by the UN Security Council have led to any humanitarian relief for the enclave. The UN says that the ""collective punishment of civilians is simply unacceptable"". The organisation said it had failed to obtain permission from Syrian officials to allow 40 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies to enter the key town of Douma. More than 600 people have been killed in the past week in the Eastern Ghouta ""Instead of a much-needed reprieve, we continue to see more fighting, more death, and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed,"" UN regional humanitarian co-ordinator Panos Moumtzis said. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the besieged enclave. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Opposition sources and journalists on the ground say that hundreds of people have been fleeing the bombardment of Beit Sawa, south of Douma and on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of the Eastern Ghouta. The enclave is an agricultural region about the size of Manchester in the UK. Residents, many of them women and children, are reported to have fled into the centre of the enclave to seek shelter. Fighting has intensified in Beit Sawa between government forces and the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. A resident speaking to the BBC described the situation in the Eastern Ghouta as ""beyond critical"". Several reports suggest government forces are attempting to cut the region in two. Syrian state media say the army has advanced on several fronts, and has taken control of villages and farms while attacking from the eastern side of the enclave. The Syrian observatory said regime forces were 3km (two miles) from Douma. The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a phone call on Sunday that Syria and its Russian backers bore responsibility for the ""heart-breaking human suffering"", Downing Street said. The leaders agreed that Russia must act now to persuade the Syrian government to stop the bombing.

"Councils in England could be stripped of planning powers if not enough homes are being built in their areas, Housing Secretary Sajid Javid has warned. Mr Javidtold the Sunday Times,externalhe would be ""breathing down"" the necks of local authorities to ensure building targets, set by the government, are met. Theresa May, who will unveil the plans on Monday, told the BBC the level of house building was a ""real problem"". However, Labour accused the government of ""eight years of failure on housing"". On Monday, the government will announce an overhaul of planning rules in an attempt to increase the rate of house building in England. A new planning policy framework will contain new rules to determine how many homes councils must build - taking into account local house prices, wages and key worker numbers.

""For the first time it will explicitly take into account the market prices,"" Mr Javid told the Sunday Times.

"Mr Trump said that ""nobody does self-deprecating humour better"" than he does US President Donald Trump joked about White House ""chaos"" and poked fun at his aides and wife in a light-hearted speech at an annual dinner on Saturday. ""Nobody does self-deprecating humour better than I do,"" he told politicians and journalists in Washington DC. Mr Trump joked about his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has reportedly had his security clearance downgraded. ""We were late tonight because Jared could not get through security,"" the president said. Kushner loses top-level White House access In wide-ranging remarks at the Gridiron Dinner, he took aim at a number of targets, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr Trump has said that he would never have appointed Mr Sessions if he had known he was going to recuse himself from leading the investigation into possible Trump ties to Russia. The president joked that he had offered Mr Sessions a ride to the event, ""and he recused himself. What are you going to do?"" Mr Trump also poked fun at: Vice-President Mike Pence:""I really am proud to call him the apprentice. But lately he's showing a particularly keen interest in the news these days. He is asking 'has he been impeached yet?' I don't like that."" White House departures:""Now the question everyone keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?"" Former chief strategist Steve Bannon:""That guy leaked more than the Titanic."" The New York Times:""I'm a New York icon. You're a New York icon. And the only difference is I still own my buildings."" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un:""As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine."" He added that North Korea had ""called up a couple of days ago"" to say they would be open for talks. ""I said so would we, but you have to denuke,"" Mr Trump said. It was not clear if this was part of the joke. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump reportedly praisedChinese President Xi Jinping's bid to extend his leadershipbeyond the constitutional limit. ""He's now president for life. He was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,"" CNN quoted him as saying. China's governing Communist Party is expected to remove a clause in the constitution which limits a president to two five-year terms later this week.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Let's actually get on and start the negotiations"" Theresa May has urged the EU to get on with discussing her ""ambitious but practical"" vision for economic relations with the UK after Brexit. The prime minister told the BBC's Andrew Marr the ""right deal for us will be the right deal for them too"". She said she was confident of a deal while accepting the UK could not expect the same market access in some areas. But the CBI said there were some ""big holes"" in the UK's plan and action was needed to stop firms moving. Conservative MPs have largely welcomed the PM's speech on Friday, in which she set out what she said were ""the hard facts"" on Brexit and the reality that neither side could have exactly what it wanted from the negotiations. While the UK was leaving the single market and customs union, she said she envisaged continued close co-operation in many areas after the UK leaves on 29 March 2019 - including remaining a member of medicines, aviation and chemicals agencies. Dublin queries May's latest NI border plan 'Hard facts for both' in Brexit talks She told Andrew Marr it was important to be ""straight"" with people that life would be different outside the EU but she believed both sides wanted the same overall outcome. ""It was a vision that was ambitious but was also practically based and therefore a credible vision,"" she said. ""The EU themselves have said they want an ambitious and wide-ranging arrangement with us in the future...  If we look at our future prosperity and in the other 27 countries, the right deal for us will be the right deal for them too."" While the UK would have the right to diverge from EU rules in some areas, she said it would ""make sense"" for the UK to keep exactly the same standards in others or achieve the same outcomes by different means. Financial services, she insisted, would be a key part of what she hopes will be the most comprehensive free trade deal ever struck. Financial services from the City of London are a key export to the EU But she said arrangements would have to change once the UK left the single market, such as the end of passporting which allows firms based in the City of London to operate across the EU without the need for licences in individual countries ""If we were to accept passporting, we would just be a rule-taker,"" she said. ""We would have to abide by their rules which were being set elsewhere. ""Given the importance of financial stability, we can't just take the same rules without any say in them."" Reality Check: Key lines in speech Brexit: All you need to know Asked what she would do if she lost a Commons vote on remaining in the customs union - with some Tory MPs set to side with Labour over the issue - she said she would be making her case to Parliament. ""What I have set out in terms of a future customs arrangement with the EU, I think, is actually what most people want to see,"" she said. A customs deal that ensured tariff-free trade and the most ""frictionless"" passage of goods was in the interests of both sides, she said. But Carolyn Fairbairn, who heads the CBI employers' group, said thousands of manufacturing businesses would lose out from being outside of the customs union. ""Some of our sectors, automotive, and others, need to stay aligned,"" she told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5Live. ""We would actually argue that many sectors want to stay aligned. ""We do not have any that say they want to diverge greatly."" Warning over hard border May rejects EU draft option on border Watch: Border bridge where stakes are high Banks needed an alternative to passporting, she said, and the UK's outline proposals ""need to be followed through very quickly because financial services firms are moving now"". ""The speech on Friday was a step forward,"" she added. ""But there are some big holes still. There is no answer still on how we can get frictionless trade."" Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said Mrs May had set out ""common sense and practical solutions"" to many of the concerns that the EU had. But former EU Commissioner Lord Mandelson said the EU would not ""in a month of Sundays"" accept a trade relationship based on mutual recognition of standards and the freedom to diverge where the UK wanted to. ""Theresa May is dancing on the head of a pin that simply does not exit and it will be painful for the country as a result,"" the former Labour cabinet minister told Andrew Marr.

"Counting went on all night at SPD headquarters in Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to form her fourth government after the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) voted in favour of another grand coalition. The vote by 464,000 rank-and-file members ends five months of political deadlock since September's election. The SPD had been split between the party's leadership, which backed joining the coalition, and its radical youth wing, which did not. Mrs Merkel, who has been in power for 12 years, congratulated the SPD. On her party's Twitter feed, she said she ""looks forward to working together again for the benefit of our country"". SPD voters approved continuing the coalition with 66% in favour. The party leadership had been concerned younger voters might veto a deal. Vote counting went on through the night at the party headquarters in Berlin. Interim SPD leader Olaf Scholz declared: ""Now we have clarity. The SPD will enter the next government"". Germany's young radicals Angela Merkel's quiet power Germany's shrewd survivor The chancellor now faces a range of challenges, including strong opposition from the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD). The anti-immigrant party entered the federal parliament for the first time in September with just over 12% of the vote and now makes up the largest opposition group. SPD members applaud as the result is announced The SPD suffered its worst ever election result and many blamed their coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) for that poor performance. Mrs Merkel, who also did badly, losing 65 seats, had tried and failed to form an alliance with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens. She was forced to pay a higher price for continuing the existing coalition - the new finance minister will be a Social Democrat. The SPD will now decide who will fill the six ministerial roles it is entitled to before Mrs Merkel's expected election by parliament on 14 March. Martin Schulz, the former high-profile SPD chairman, had put himself forward as a possible foreign minister, but dropped the plan amid internal party squabbles over who should fill the post. He had also annoyed many party members by first ruling out a coalition in the aftermath of the SPD's poor election showing only to enter talks later. The end to uncertainty, including the possibility of fresh elections, will be greeted with relief in the European Union's institutions, where Germany, Europe's largest economy, is a major influence. Analysis by Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin Germany has waited nearly six months for this. Its new government is a continuation of the last one - a coalition between Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, or SPD. Mrs Merkel will no doubt be relieved. But this is no glorious victory. The SPD - which had the final say on the coalition deal - has torn itself apart over the decision to renew the alliance. Many members still oppose it and the internal schism has worsened what were already dismal approval ratings. There's also limited public enthusiasm for the union. Months of political wrangling (don't forget Mrs Merkel tried - and failed - to form a coalition with the Green and FDP parties) have done little to inspire confidence in Germany's established parties.

"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Theresa May has warned that ""no-one will get everything they want"" out of Brexit negotiations but she is confident a deal can be done. Setting out UK hopes for a future EU economic partnership, Mrs May warned both sides had to accept ""hard facts"". Single market access would be ""less than it is now"" and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU said: ""Let's get on with it."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after to smooth the way for business. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Mrs May said she was confidentremaining differences over a draft EU legal agreementcould be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be that the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal - but she stressed that the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"". The speech contained a lot of detail on the kind of trading relationship Mrs May wants with the EU after Brexit. Banks located in the City of London will lose the right to trade across EU without country-by-country approval, so-called passporting. A new system will be brought in to allow ""the same regulatory outcomes over time"" Associate membership of EU medicines, chemical and aviation agencies, accepting their rules and making ""appropriate"" financial contributions Parliament would reserve the right to pass its own regulations in these areas but in the knowledge it could threaten co-operation with those bodies Continued participation in EU science, education and cultural programmes, close relationship with Euratom UK to explore continued participation in EU's internal energy market while protecting single energy market on the island of Ireland Independent arbitration mechanism for trade disputes to replace role currently played the European Court of Justice Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management Mutual recognition of broadcasting rules to allow UK channels to continue to be seen in Europe Ensure continuity of rail, maritime and aviation services and of hauliers' access to European markets Keeping UK regulatory standards ""as high as the EU's"" to ensure smooth trade and while UK law may not be ""identical"" to EU law ""it should achieve the same outcomes"" This video can not be played Corbyn: Speech offered ""no clarity and no real sense of priorities"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After 20 wasted months, Theresa May has once again failed to bring real clarity to the negotiations - and worryingly, she admitted that her approach will reduce our access to European markets. ""She read out a long list of problems but failed to provide solutions, particularly on the urgent question of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Attacking Mrs May's suggestion the UK could stick closely to EU state aid rules, he added:  ""Theresa May's only clear priority today seemed to be to tie the UK permanently to EU rules which are used to drive privatisation and block support for British industry."" By BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming A European civil servant said to me recently that Brexit was a fascinating intellectual exercise in rebuilding the existing elements of the UK/EU relationship but with Britain out of the club. Is that the same thing the prime minister proposed today, with the UK retaining associate membership of many of the EU's agencies, choosing to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice where needed, trading freely and maintaining broadly similar economic and social models? One geeky-sounding proposal in particular demonstrates how ambitious - and potentially tricky - this could be. Mrs May said she wanted a bespoke deal for sharing data that went beyond the EU's usual tool of judging third countries' laws to be of equivalent status to Europe's. Yesterday Michel Barnier rejected this idea in advance. The EU chief negotiator tweeted some lukewarm praise today (lukewarm will be more than enough for Downing Street). But the EU's formal reaction will come next week the European Council President Donald Tusk publishes his first draft of guidelines for the phase of Brexit talks where all of this will be tackled. The prime minister called for a free trade agreement covering most sectors of the economy, going further than the deal signed between Canada and the EU but stopping short of Norway which is a member of the European Economic Area. ""We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,"" she said. She again said a hard Irish border or a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be ""unacceptable"" and said it was for the UK and EU to ""work together"" on a solution. She suggested this could be either a customs partnership, where the UK ""mirrors"" EU requirements on goods from around the world, or a streamlined customs arrangement, using technology and ""trusted trader"" schemes to do away with the need for customs checks. Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to ""cherry-pick"" the best parts of the bloc's rules, she said: ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The speech got a positive reaction from Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeting: ""We will remain extremely close to our EU friends and partners - but able to innovate, to set our own agenda, to make our own laws and to do ambitious free trade deals around the world."" But pro-European Tory rebel Anna Soubry told the BBC that Leave voters would be right to question what was in it for them. ""The Brexit we are heading towards is very, very different to the one we were promised,"" she said. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the speech, saying it provided ""clarity"" about  the UK leaving the single market and customs union and a ""recognition"" that trade-offs will inform future talks on a deal. But the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt was not impressed. He said: ""Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations, we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake. "" The DUP, whom Mrs May relies on for key Commons votes, welcomed Mrs May's ""clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". Leader Arlene Foster said she had ""set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK.  Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short."" Business group the CBI tweeted: ""Excellent news if UK can stay in key agencies like EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) - glad PM has focused on them."" The TUC said there was ""still a chasm between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theresa May has delivered her long-awaitedspeech on Brexit,external, giving more details of what she wants from the UK's future trade arrangements with the European Union. Here are some of the key lines from the speech. There was a time when government ministers were suggesting that this was going to be the easiest negotiation in history. That rhetoric has gone. The prime minister suggested that there would be difficult days ahead, and inevitable points of disagreement. The bottom line is that Mrs May still intends to take the UK out of the single market and the customs union. But she emphasised that both sides stand to gain from the successful negotiation of a new partnership, whereas the EU still sees Brexit not as a win-win but as a lose-lose. After the uproar ofthe past couple of days,the prime minister decided that she needed to address Northern Ireland early on. It was a re-statement of what was agreed last December - no hard border with the Republic, but no customs border with the rest of the UK either. The trouble is there wasn't much detail about how that circle can be squared. Later in the speech she did speak about the use of technology at the border and a streamlined customs arrangement or even a new-style customs partnership (but not a customs union). Scepticism about the UK position in Dublin, and elsewhere in Europe, won't have eased all that much. Yes, the prime minister says to the EU, you have a point - we can't just pick off the good bits (although there will be those who argue that she tries to do just that later in the speech). But there was an honest appraisal here of the ""hard facts"" - notably that market access will be less than it is now, and that the UK will still have to take account, in some respects, of the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It was a realistic appraisal of where any successful negotiation is likely to end. On the other hand, the prime minister insisted that the UK will still want to demonstrate that it has taken back control of its money, its border, and its laws. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but there will be those who point out that the broadest and deepest possible partnership anywhere in the world today is enshrined in the EU's single market and customs union. It was striking in this speech how much of the current relationship Mrs May wants to keep - staying close, for example, to EU regulatory agencies, to environmental and consumer protection laws, and to EU policies on state aid and fair competition. But the prime minister also reserved the right to diverge from EU policies where necessary. In Brussels and elsewhere, that will still be seen as cherry-picking, and will be unacceptable to EU negotiators who are determined to protect theintegrity of the single market,external. This was important. A bonfire of EU regulations is not going to happen. And if the UK can successfully negotiate a new model of associate membership of EU agencies, that regulate chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the aviation industry, large sections of UK business will breathe a sigh of relief. Mrs May offered to pay for access to these agencies, and much of the expertise the EU relies upon is based in the UK. But there will still be disagreements about judicial oversight and the role of the European Court of Justice. It is another reminder of how much there is to negotiate in an extraordinarily short period of time, and why a transition period after Brexit will be so important. Mrs May called for a bold and creative agreement on services - a sector of over-riding importance to the UK economy. She mentioned two sectors in particular - broadcasting and financial services - that have never been properly covered in a free trade agreement before. Her argument is a familiar one - restricting access in all areas of economic activity will hurt you as much as it hurts us. She spoke of the UK and the EU maintaining the same regulations over time while accepting there would be ""consequences"" (loss of market access) if the UK chose a different path. On the one hand, it doesn't sound like ""ambitious managed divergence"" and that may not be acceptable to some supporters of Brexit in the UK. On the other hand, it does mean the UK sticking to some EU rules and not others - and that will not be acceptable in other capitals around Europe. Or as the prime minister said in her speech: ""This is a negotiation and neither of us can have exactly what we want.""

The 31-year-old man was found critically injured at a property in Parkhouse Drive, Erdington, at 22:00 GMT on Friday. West Midlands Police said he died in hospital at 18:00 on Saturday. A man aged 30 and a 17-year-old male were arrested in Parkhouse Drive in connection with the death and remain in custody. Firearms officers were deployed to the scene on Friday night.

"This video can not be played Watch: Undercover filming of conman's voice actor session A conman jailed in 2013 for duping elderly victims out of thousands of pounds has resurfaced with a new money-making venture, the BBC can reveal. Carl Mould, 52, from Nottingham, has been posing as voice actor Edward C Harwell, offering to help people make money from audiobook narration. It is estimated he has taken Â£100,000 in 18 months from dozens of customers, one of whom was left feeling ""a fool"". When confronted, Mould said he had not done anything wrong. His company Sun King Media, which was based at the Custard Factory arts complex in Birmingham, says it provides ""related vocational training inspired by our continued success in global media"", and claims to be ""recognised by the market leaders as key account openers in a subscription based book sharing programme worth over Â£10m"". Sun King Media's website offers ""free voice over assessments"" During a secretly-filmed voice assessment session, Mould said he was affiliated with Audible, Amazon's audiobook company, and has told people he can help them become narrators. He has targeted actors, many retired former professionals, through their listings on casting websites, always with the same sales pitch, telling them they are perfect for voiceover work and could earn thousands. Flattered by the approach and his assessment of their talent, many were persuaded to hand over cash in order to make it happen. The 30 victims the BBC has traced have handed Mould an average of Â£2,000 each. These customers say all they received were poor quality recordings, uploaded to free-to-use websites and a microphone and home recording studio which was a wooden box, padded with foam. Budding voice actors say they received shoddy equipment, such as this ""home recording studio"" David Taylor should know a conman when he sees one - he met many during his 35-year career in the prison service. For 20 years he was a governor, including at HMP Gartree in Leicestershire and HMP Manchester. When he retired in 2013, he returned to his first love of acting. ""I joined a few agencies to get some extras jobs on films and TV as well as to try and break into the voiceover industry. Speaking about Mould, he said: ""He is a character who exudes confidence and talks to you and convinces you that these things he's telling you are quite genuine. ""He showed me invoices, made out to himself, or Ed C Harwell, for Â£10,000 a month for the recording he had done from Amazon Books."" Mr Taylor did not get any work after giving Mould Â£1,500 and initially took that to be just another performing arts rejection. ""When something doesn't come of anything, you just put it down to experience. This was something slightly different because it was a big outlay. ""Given my background, I feel as if I should have been slightly more wary. And that's the bit I'm really ashamed of, that I should've seen through it - I just feel a fool. ""I'm sure that most of the victims of his cons thought that he was an absolutely charming fella; that's why he's so good at it I suppose."" Carl Mould said he had ""done nothing wrong"" when confronted by the BBC Audible, part of the Amazon Group, said in a statement: ""Audible is proud of its longstanding connection to the creative community and narrators are at the heart of Audible's work. ""We take this misrepresentation of us and our work very seriously. Our lawyers are contacting Sun King Media."" Ian Bayes, Midlands organiser for actors' union Equity, said it had received a number of complaints from members about Edward C Harwell and Sun King Media. ""These [complaints] have been passed on to our legal department which is currently investigating those claims. ""We always advise our members to contact the union if they are offered work but, before that work materialises, they are asked to pay an upfront fee."" The BBC understands Mould has since left his offices at the Custard Factory, which says it terminated his lease after his activities were brought to its attention. 2001 - Carl Mould was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court to three years in prison for nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception. A widow in her 80s was conned out of Â£30,000 of her life savings for poor building work on her bungalow in Carlton, Nottingham 2008 - Mould's ""Broadcast Support"" scamwas exposed by BBC Inside Out. He charged dozens of people, many of them pensioners, thousands of pounds for shoddy showreels and poor websites after claiming he could help them to get work in film or on TV 2013 - Mouldwas jailed for five yearsfor his role in a mobility aids scam in which the elderly and infirm were charged over the odds for products that often did not arrive. Mould even claimed to be a doctor at one point and escorted one elderly victim to the bank After being confronted in Birmingham and asked if he was sorry for taking money from people, Mould said: ""I'm not sorry for anything. I have not done anything wrong."" In a letter, Mould said if anyone was unhappy with the service he had provided, ""they could come back and record it again"". He added: ""We refute your claims that we target 'older', 'vulnerable' or 'retired' people as nonsense. We had an opportunity listed on a website which provides a media platform for 'current working actors'."" Peter Dickson, one of the UK's best known voiceover artists and the voice of the X Factor, who was shown the footage, said: ""This is a skill you need to learn and it takes time and practice. ""That appalling value for money he's got there is just saddening and sickening.""

"Antonio Russo, his father Raffaele and cousin Vincenzo disappeared on 31 January Mexican authorities have launched criminal proceedings against four police officers over the disappearance of three Italian men. The missing men - all from Naples - were last seen on 31 January in TecalitlÃ¡n, in the western state of Jalisco. The state's governor said the officers had confessed to handing the Italians over to a local criminal gang. The police had allegedly arrested them at a petrol station beforehand. Raffaele Russo, 60, his 25-year-old son Antonio, and his nephew, Vincenzo Cimmino, 29, had stopped at a petrol station in TecalitlÃ¡n, an agricultural town. The last relatives back in Italy heard from them was a Whatsapp message from Mr Russo saying they had been approached by police officers who arrived on cycles and in a van. The police told them to follow them, according to the message. The son of one of the disappeared earlier told Italian radio that the men had been ""sold to a gang for â¬43"" ($53; Â£38), but regional officials said they could not confirm that information. The area is controlled by the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful criminal gangs. Four police, including a female officer, have been detained and charged. The Mexican authorities say three more police are being sought in connection with the disappearance. Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Gang arrests fail to drive down violence Following the trio's disappearance, the town's entire police force was sent for retraining, although some local media speculated that they were sent away so that they could not be intimidated by local cartel members into changing their story. TecalitlÃ¡n lies in territory controlled by one of Mexico's most powerful criminal gangs It is not absolutely clear, but reports say they were there to sell Chinese merchandise. Jalisco State Prosecutor RaÃºl SÃ¡nchez said he had information showing the three were selling cheap generators and agricultural machinery which they passed off as high-quality branded goods. Relatives in their home town denied the three were doing anything illegal in Mexico. A government crackdown on drug cartels since 2006 led to fragmentation, internal conflicts and new groups forming The cartel was founded when Milenio Cartel, originally a branch of Sinaloa syndicate, split It was created in 2011 in western Jalisco state and is notorious for violent attacks on security forces, including the shooting down of a government military helicopter It's led by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias El Mencho, 53. The group has fought for supremacy with Zetas Cartel in Veracruz state, leaving dozens dead It presents itself to residents in its territory as a force to rid them of other crime gangs Its interests include opium and marijuana growing, with assets estimated in the billions of dollars Read more on organised crime in Mexico,external Mexican media have drawn parallels between this case and that of43 Mexican students who disappeared from the town of Iguala in 2014. The state prosecutor in that case said that the students were handed by corrupt local police to a criminal gang, who killed them and burned their bodies. Local police, who are poorly trained and poorly paid, are often threatened or bribed by criminal gangs to turn a blind eye or even do their bidding. For that reason, federal authorities often send federal police forces and even soldiers to the most violent areas. Most visits to the country are trouble free, but violent crime and gang activity pose a risk in certain areas. Last month, the US state department warned tourists to ""completely avoid"" five states because of rampant crime levels. Colima, Guerrero, MichoacÃ¡n, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas are classified as a level-four risk, the highest in the scale, and the same as countries such as Iraq and Syria. The state department says tourists should avoid driving at night, be extra vigilant when using ATMs and avoid wearing expensive jewellery. The UK Foreign Office says tourists should research their destination thoroughly before travelling because violence is concentrated in specific areas. It says drug-related violence is a problem in Jalisco, where the three missing men were last seen. The Foreign Office also says kidnapping is a risk, and there have been allegations of police involvement. It advises tourists to be discreet about discussing financial affairs in public and to inform relatives and friends of your travel plans.

"What happens now that President Donald Trump has said he will move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminium products? Analysts are warning of a trade war, as officials from Europe, Asia and Latin Americathreaten retaliation. Mr Trump predicted it would be ""easy"" for the US to win. But most economists and trade experts reject that view, saying every country, including the US, stands to lose in the event of a serious trade fight. ""If what we're talking about is who gets hurt the least, that would probably be the United States, but all countries get hurt in a trade war,"" says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's why ""winning"" might not be so easy for the US. The United States Steel Corporation plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania Mr Trump promoted his decision as a win for the steel and aluminium industries and said he expects investment and hiring to follow. Trump steel tariffs: European Union gears up for trade war Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? But technological changes have made the industry less labour intensive. Historians say previous efforts to protect steel jobs have been largely ineffective. The companies present at Mr Trump's announcement did not respond to BBC inquiries about potential expansions. A 2002 analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics,externalof proposed tariffs predicted the measures would ""save"" just 3,500 jobs. Companies that use aluminium and steel, like brewers, are worried about higher costs Today,the steel industry estimates,externalthat it employs about 140,000 people - far fewer than in the sectors that rely on it. Criticism of the tariffs from those firms was immediate. For example, the National Retail Federation blasted it as a ""tax on American families"". US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said companies were over-reacting, but Mr Alden says the economic costs will be serious. The Charlotte Observer reports,externalthat Electrolux, manufacturer of washing machines and cookers, has already put on hold an expansion planned for Tennessee. Individual industries and countries - especially places that are already negotiating wider trade deals such as Canada - will be lobbying furiously in the coming days for exemptions from the final tariffs. Absent that, analysts say they expect retaliation - and a broader weakening of the global free trade system. Countries could complain to the World Trade Organisation, but such cases take years and Mr Trump has been dismissive of that body. Moreover, WTO judges may be hesitant to second-guess the rarely used ""national security"" rationale the US has used to justify the tariffs, says Columbia Law professor Petros Mavroidis. Those factors make unilateral retaliatory tariffs more likely, he says. Such actions, which are expected to target industries in politically sensitive US states, could be in place within a year, he says. The US blames China for flooding the market with cheap steel and aluminium and has already stepped up protective measures against Chinese steel products. Mr Trump says wider tariffs are necessary to stop Chinese steel appearing in the US via other countries. But US businesses, including those in the car, tech and agriculture industries, are eager to get into the Chinese market, givingleaders there some leverage. Mr Trump isn't unique among US presidents inusing trade policy,externalto protect politically strategic industries. But how beneficial such actions are is difficult to decipher, given the time lag between the decisions and elections, says Kenneth Lowande, a research fellow at Princeton University's Center for the Study of Democratic Politics. At the moment, Democrats are among the most vocal defenders of the president's trade policy. Will Donald Trump mean the end of global trade? Is Trump wise to take on China over trade?

"President Trump announced his intention to impose a 25% tariff on all US steel imports at the White House. President Donald Trump's announcement that the US would impose a 25% tariff on the imports of steel entering the US has shaken the stock market and rattled some of America's closest trading partners. The President is expected to sign the orderto impose the tariffsnext week. But for workers in America's steel industry, the decision was the fulfilment of a promise President Trump made to them during the 2016 election. ""Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State Building, it will be American steel that will fortify America's crumbling bridges,"" President Trump said at a campaign rally. But for some US steelworkers, the decision to act may already be too late. The ArcelorMittal steel mill in Conshohocken is getting rid of 150 workers Kimberly Allen may be one of them. For the last 23 years, she has worked 12-hour shifts at the Conshohocken steel mill in Pennsylvania. It's a job that allowed her to provide for her son as a single mother and one that will be hard to replace if she loses it during two rounds of cuts set for April and August. ""I was able to build my house and provided a good lifestyle for my son, but now I'm in jeopardy of having to start all over again,"" she says. The 47-year-old followed her father's footsteps when she entered the steel industry and was able to earn up to $75,000 (Â£54,500) some years. In September 2017 the plant's owner ArcelorMittal announced it planned to idle the rolling mill and cut at least 150 of the 205 workers. The mill will not be fully closed and the company could restart production if the prospects for US steel change. ""Right now we are in limbo,"" Ms Allen says. Kemeen Thompson, president of the local union, said it was President Trump's promise to protect manufacturing jobs and tackle trade imbalances that convinced many union members to vote for him. Kameen Thompson is the head of the local steel workers union Pennsylvania is a traditional stronghold for the Democratic Party, but Donald Trump was able to win over many blue-collar workers who were a key to his victory in that state. Like President Trump, Mr Thompson says his members aren't anti-trade they just want it to be more balanced. ""We're not saying don't trade, but it has to be fair trade,"" says Mr Thompson. That's a sentiment often repeated by President Trump. Many of the members, he says, are unprepared to look for jobs again. Most have worked in the Conshohocken steel mill for over a decade. Chuck Hauer, a Trump-voter who has worked in the plant for nearly a quarter of a century, says the plant has seen dips and faced job cuts before, but not like this. President Trump has promised to protect US manufacturing jobs ""This time was different. This time we were given a date and a hard number [for the job cuts],"" he says. The steel industry in theUS directly employed just 140,000 people,externalin 2015 according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. The organisation, which represents US steel companies, was quick to heap praise on the White House's announcement. But while the industry may now be breathing a sigh of relief others fear the tariffs could lead to a hike in the price of cars and construction. It could also lead to retaliation from other trading partners. Imposing these steel tariffs could ""erode the rules-based world trade system,"" according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Countries are likely to challenge the US decision in international court arguing it violates World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, he says. MostUS steel imports,externalcome from Canada, Brazil and South Korea. President Trump and the US steel industry though has focused much of their blame on China. The US is the world's largest importer of steel Mexico, China and the European Union have all said they would consider punitive tariffs. Among the EU's discussed targets for retaliation are bourbon from Kentucky and dairy from Wisconsin. Those states are home to the highest ranking members of the US congress. These tariffs could also derail the renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and trade talks with South Korea. ""If you try to use trade restrictions here you won't hurt China you will hurt your friends,"" says Mr Brown. President Trump met with steel industry bosses at the White House to announce the tariffs In 2005, China produced nearly a third of the world's steel. By 2017, it was nearer to half the global supply. But as China's economy slowed and the amount of Chinese domestic construction dipped, so did local steel consumption. Prices of the metal have fallen for the past five years as excess supply in China weighted on the international market. The US tariffs won't cause that oversupply to go away and workers in Conshohocken know that. For now, they are just grateful the US President has finally acted. Chuck Hauer is doubtful the move will save his role, but he believes it will help the industry which he says is the ""cornerstone of America"". For the wider US economy though a potential trade war could put the future of many more industries  into limbo.

"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Brexiteers will have some concerns with Theresa May's latest Brexit speech but ""now is not the time to nitpick"", Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalthe prominent Eurosceptic praised the prime minister and urged the EU to respond with ""wisdom and not aggression"". On Friday, Mrs May warned ""no-one will get everything they want"" from talks. EU officials are now scrutinising Mrs May's speech ahead of a fresh round of negotiations next week. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC's Today programme the prime minister had shown in her speech it was possible to have ""frictionless trade"" with the European Union while leaving the single market and the customs union. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Speaking at London's Mansion House, Mrs May set out the UK's hopes for a future EU economic partnership, calling for ""pragmatic common sense"" in negotiations. Single market access would be ""less than it is now"", she said, and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she said she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU added: ""Let's get on with it."" She said all sides of the argument had to now face ""hard facts"". Mr Rees-Mogg praised her ""good speech"", saying it delivered on the government's promise to take the UK out of the customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice. ""There are inevitably a few small points that will concern Leave campaigners but we must all recognise that everyone will have to give up something to get a deal, so now is not the time to nitpick,"" he wrote. Mrs May's address was also cautiously welcomed by pro-European Conservatives. Writing in the same paper, Tory Remainer Nicky Morgan said her speech was a ""welcome dose of realism"". ""The EU can't say they don't know what the UK wants anymore,"" she added. Mr Hunt told the BBC Mrs May had successfully brought Leavers and Remainers together. She had explained in the speech, he said, how there would be ""pragmatic alignment of our regulations"" that would be of the same high standards as in European countries, but on a voluntary basis. Parliament would have the final say and the UK could always choose to have less market access. He said he was certain the negotiations would ""go to the wire"". Speaking on BBC's Newsnight the vice-president of the European Parliament, the Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, said the speech showed the realities of Brexit ""were dawning"" in the UK. She said some of Mrs May's proposals amounted to the UK wanting ""to be part of the European Union""Not time to nitpick on Brexit - Rees-Moggin all but name. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he feared the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market have not been fully recognised by Mrs May's government. ""Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short,"" he said. In her speech, Mrs May said she was confident remaining differences over a draft EU legal agreement could be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal. However, she stressed the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"".

"President Trump's backingfor slapping tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar panelswill hit China and South Korea hardest. And it has opened up the prospect of some retaliation - especially from Beijing. The hardline Chinese publication Global Times says ""nothing good"" would come out of a trade war with President Trump, and has warned that China could fight back. There's lots at stake.The two countries did $578.6bn worth of trade in 2016.,external And by the US government's own estimates that trade supports just under a million American jobs. So what could China do? Well here are a few options: China says the US tariffs are bad for global trade and has already said that it will work with other WTO members to defend itself. Of course there will be plenty  in Washington who won't miss the irony of China - much-maligned for its own trade practices - complaining that it is being hard done to. Last May, the US and China signed a deal to allow, amongst other things, the resumption of US beef exports to China after 14 years. But there arespecific requirements from the Chinese that US beef companies need to adhere to,external. Although trade has barely just begun, China could raise these health and safety standards and make life far more difficult for the US beef exporting businesses that are looking to capitalise on middle class Chinese consumers. China is the world's biggest passenger car market. By 2022it will contribute to over half of the world's car growth,external. China is also consistentlyamong the top five export markets for US cars and car parts,external, so a directive from the government to stop buying American cars out of loyalty to the Chinese state would hurt US manufacturers. It's not unheard of for Beijing to dictate how Chinese consumers spend their money. Korean retailer Lotte Mart for example, suffered massive losses in China because of the Beijing-Seoul spat over a US anti-missile system. China is the world's leading outbound tourist market, with more than 130 million Chinese people travelling around the world each year - a number that just keeps rising. They spend something like $260bn (Â£185.2bn) a year when they travel,external, and while the most popular Chinese tourist spots tend to be in Asia, the US has also benefited. Chinese tourists are projected to spend$450bn on holidays and shopping overseas by 2025,external, so the US could lose out if Beijing says America is an unsavoury place to travel to. China owns more than a $1tn of US debt,external. It has threatened to sell US Treasuries before, and many have worried that this level of debt could mean that Beijing has leverage over the US economy. But the truth is even if China did sell US debt,it would most likely be picked up by other countries,external. General Motors sells about 70% more cars in China than it does in the US The reality is China doesn't want a trade spat to from escalate into a more damaging confrontation. If a trade war between the two countries does escalate, it won't just be Beijing and the US losing out. The wider Asian region could suffer too, simply because of how integrated global supply chains are.,external But we might well be just days away from more tariffs - with President Trump to soon decide whether to slap extra duties on steel and aluminium imports.  China is the world's largest producer of both. Then there's theintellectual property theft investigation against China,external, or Section 301, the findings of which should be released soon. Now, as I've said before,President Trump hasn't really been as hard on China as he said he would during his election campaign- partly because he needs Beijing onside to help push North Korea into giving up its aggressive nuclear strategy. But with more pressure coming from the voters who elected him, the Republican base, and mid-terms this year - President Trump could decide that now's the time to finally push his 'America first' policy through.

"Councils in England could be stripped of planning powers if not enough homes are being built in their areas, Housing Secretary Sajid Javid has warned. Mr Javidtold the Sunday Times,externalhe would be ""breathing down"" the necks of local authorities to ensure building targets, set by the government, are met. Theresa May, who will unveil the plans on Monday, told the BBC the level of house building was a ""real problem"". However, Labour accused the government of ""eight years of failure on housing"". On Monday, the government will announce an overhaul of planning rules in an attempt to increase the rate of house building in England. A new planning policy framework will contain new rules to determine how many homes councils must build - taking into account local house prices, wages and key worker numbers. Higher targets will be set for areas where house prices outstrip annual earnings. House price calculator: Where can I afford to rent or buy? Your biggest financial decision - in charts Reality Check: How does renting a home in the UK compare? ""For the first time it will explicitly take into account the market prices,"" Mr Javid told the Sunday Times. ""If you are in an area where the unaffordability ratio is much higher you will have to build even more. It will make clear to councils that this number is a minimum, not a maximum."" He said councils would also be held to account on house-building promises they make. Mr Javid said councils that fail to meet targets will be stripped of the right to decide what is built within their boundaries, with inspectors making decisions instead. This video can not be played 'Government will intervene' on house building Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the government would ""release more public sector land"" to facilitate more building of homes. She added: ""We're saying to councils you've got to take local communities into account, you've got to ensure you've got a proper plan for your local area. If you haven't got it the government will intervene."" Chief executive of housing charity Shelter, Polly Neate, said it appeared the government was ""waking up to the scale of our housing emergency"". ""The planning system is not delivering for most people at the moment and the key test for Theresa May and Sajid Javid will be whether the plans they announce on Monday will be able to unblock the obstacles to building the genuinely affordable homes that our communities desperately need and which this government has so far not been able to deliver,"" she added. Mr Javid said his new rules were designed to stop ""Nimby [Not In My Back Yard] councils that don't really want to build the homes their local community needs"" from fudging the numbers in their area. ""We have a housing crisis in this country. We need a housing revolution,"" he added. Mr Javid also revealed plans to build up to five new towns between Oxford and Cambridge. ""Along that corridor there's an opportunity to build at least four or five garden towns and villages with thousands of homes,"" he added. It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May last month declared it her ""personal mission to build the homes this country needs so we can restore the dream of home ownership"". In November, Chancellor Philip Hammond abolished stamp duty on homes up to Â£300,000 for first-time buyers. However, John Healey, Labour's shadow housing minister, said Mr Javid's ""year-old policy"" showed the government has ""no proper plan to fix the housing crisis"". ""Eight years of failure on housing is the fault of Whitehall, not town halls,"" he said. ""Since 2010, home ownership has fallen to a 30-year low, rough sleeping has more than doubled, and the number of new homes being built still hasn't recovered to pre-recession levels.""

"Counting went on all night at SPD headquarters in Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to form her fourth government after the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) voted in favour of another grand coalition. The vote by 464,000 rank-and-file members ends five months of political deadlock since September's election. The SPD had been split between the party's leadership, which backed joining the coalition, and its radical youth wing, which did not. Mrs Merkel, who has been in power for 12 years, congratulated the SPD. On her party's Twitter feed, she said she ""looks forward to working together again for the benefit of our country"". SPD voters approved continuing the coalition with 66% in favour. The party leadership had been concerned younger voters might veto a deal.

SPD members applaud as the result is announced The SPD suffered its worst ever election result and many blamed their coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) for that poor performance. Mrs Merkel, who also did badly, losing 65 seats, had tried and failed to form an alliance with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens. She was forced to pay a higher price for continuing the existing coalition - the new finance minister will be a Social Democrat. The SPD will now decide who will fill the six ministerial roles it is entitled to before Mrs Merkel's expected election by parliament on 14 March.

He had also annoyed many party members by first ruling out a coalition in the aftermath of the SPD's poor election showing only to enter talks later. The end to uncertainty, including the possibility of fresh elections, will be greeted with relief in the European Union's institutions, where Germany, Europe's largest economy, is a major influence. Analysis by Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin Germany has waited nearly six months for this. Its new government is a continuation of the last one - a coalition between Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, or SPD. Mrs Merkel will no doubt be relieved. But this is no glorious victory. The SPD - which had the final say on the coalition deal - has torn itself apart over the decision to renew the alliance. Many members still oppose it and the internal schism has worsened what were already dismal approval ratings. There's also limited public enthusiasm for the union. Months of political wrangling (don't forget Mrs Merkel tried - and failed - to form a coalition with the Green and FDP parties) have done little to inspire confidence in Germany's established parties.

Its new government is a continuation of the last one - a coalition between Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, or SPD. Mrs Merkel will no doubt be relieved. But this is no glorious victory. The SPD - which had the final say on the coalition deal - has torn itself apart over the decision to renew the alliance. Many members still oppose it and the internal schism has worsened what were already dismal approval ratings. There's also limited public enthusiasm for the union. Months of political wrangling (don't forget Mrs Merkel tried - and failed - to form a coalition with the Green and FDP parties) have done little to inspire confidence in Germany's established parties. Angela Merkel, herself profoundly damaged by the whole episode, has her work cut out now if she's to deliver the stability she promised her country.

"Director Jordan Peele (C) accepts the best feature award for Get Out Get Out has been named best film at the Film Independent Spirit Awards - which has predicted the best picture winner at the Oscars four years running. Moonlight was seen as an outsider when it picked up the same award at the 2017 event before winning the Oscar. Jordan Peele was named best director, for what is his feature film debut, at the beachside event in Los Angeles. The Spirit Awards honour low-budget films and are seen as the precursor to the Academy Awards on Sunday. Asked about the possibility of black horror film Get Out repeating the success of Moonlight in 2017 - and Spotlight, Birdman and 12 Years a Slave the previous years - Peele simply said: ""It's Saturday. Tomorrow's tomorrow."" Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out, for which he's nominated for a best actor Oscar He is the first black filmmaker to be nominated for best picture, best director and best screenwriting. He told the audience at the Santa Monica event: ""I think it's clear to everybody in this room, across the country and across the world, that we're at the beginning of a renaissance right now. ""Our stories from the outside, stories from the people in this room - the same stories that independent filmmakers have been telling for years - are being recognised and honoured."" He said the 23-day-shoot was ""scrappy"" and that he cried every day because he was so drained. ""This was not a film where anyone got a paycheque,"" he said. ""We did this because we believed in the story. It wasn't a story anybody had seen before - it needed to exist."" The film stars London-born Daniel Kaluuya, who - when asked if he would star in a sequel if one was made - replied with incredulity: ""Would I like to be in a Jordan Peele script? We just won!"" Daniel Kaluuya (L) and Allison Williams play a couple in the box office smash Speaking about the prospect of a sequel, Peele said: ""We are not closed off to a sequel. The producers and I agree this is not the kind of movie you make a sequel to just to make a sequel, to make money. ""If we can get a story that feels worthy as a follow-up in this world, then we'll do it."" Get Out star responds to Samuel L Jackson comments Oscars 2018: The nominees in full Eight ways the 2018 Oscars will be different WATCH: The Oscars best picture contenders - in 45 seconds Peele said of Get Out - about a black man who steps into a nightmare when he visits his white girlfriend's family: ""This project didn't start as a statement - it began as me wanting to make a film in my favourite genreâ¦ mind-bending horror."" Spirit Awards - the main winners Best feature - Get Out Best director - Jordan Peele, Get Out Best screenplay - Greta Gerwig, Lady Bird Best first screenplay - Emily V Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, The Big Sick Best supporting female - Allison Janney, I, Tonya Best supporting male - Sam Rockwell, Three Billboards Best female lead - Frances McDormand, Three Billboards Best male lead - Timothee Chalamet, Call Me By Your Name Robert Altman award - Mudbound, directed by Dee Rees The Spirit Awards honour films that have been made for a budget of $20m or less. Get Out had a budget of $4.5m and made $255m at the box office. Frances McDormand picked up the best actress award for her role as a grieving mother hell-bent on getting justice in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - she's widely expected to get the same title at the Oscars. She said she appreciated the fact she could swear during the more informal awards (""the dress code is 'get dressed'"", co-host John Mulaney had quipped) and added: ""I am independent and I'm spirited - that's why I'm here."" Timothee Chalamet, who won best actor for Call Me By Your Name - a romance set in 1980s Italy - told the event that he thought change was on the way in the film industry. Timothee Chalamet stars opposite Armie Hammer in gay romance Call Me By Your Name ""This is a whole new wave - we're going to be fine, we're going to be good,"" he said. ""We're going to make this change."" Call Me By Your Name, starring Armie Hammer - who FaceTimed Chalamet during the awards, also won best cinematography. Other awards went to Allison Janney for best supporting actress for I, Tonya and Sam Rockwell, best supporting actor for Three Billboards. Janney is widely tipped to win the Oscar for playing LaVona Golden, the domineering mother of figure skater Tonya Harding. ""I've played a lot of confused and complicated women, but not any women this dark,"" she said. ""I don't think people usually think of me this way. I guess I want to play more evil, dark characters."" Allison Janney poses with her best supporting actress award for I, Tonya Asked about the fact Jimmy Kimmel has indicated he won't focus on Me Too and the Time's Up movement when hosting the Oscars on Sunday, she said: ""Jimmy Kimmel's got a huge task in hand to host the Oscars. I know he's going to do a fantastic job. ""I think the movement is being addressed in so many other ways - I'm leaving it in his capable hands.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Undercover filming of conman's voice actor session A conman jailed in 2013 for duping elderly victims out of thousands of pounds has resurfaced with a new money-making venture, the BBC can reveal. Carl Mould, 52, from Nottingham, has been posing as voice actor Edward C Harwell, offering to help people make money from audiobook narration. It is estimated he has taken Â£100,000 in 18 months from dozens of customers, one of whom was left feeling ""a fool"". When confronted, Mould said he had not done anything wrong. His company Sun King Media, which was based at the Custard Factory arts complex in Birmingham, says it provides ""related vocational training inspired by our continued success in global media"", and claims to be ""recognised by the market leaders as key account openers in a subscription based book sharing programme worth over Â£10m"". Sun King Media's website offers ""free voice over assessments"" During a secretly-filmed voice assessment session, Mould said he was affiliated with Audible, Amazon's audiobook company, and has told people he can help them become narrators. He has targeted actors, many retired former professionals, through their listings on casting websites, always with the same sales pitch, telling them they are perfect for voiceover work and could earn thousands. Flattered by the approach and his assessment of their talent, many were persuaded to hand over cash in order to make it happen. The 30 victims the BBC has traced have handed Mould an average of Â£2,000 each. These customers say all they received were poor quality recordings, uploaded to free-to-use websites and a microphone and home recording studio which was a wooden box, padded with foam. Budding voice actors say they received shoddy equipment, such as this ""home recording studio"" David Taylor should know a conman when he sees one - he met many during his 35-year career in the prison service. For 20 years he was a governor, including at HMP Gartree in Leicestershire and HMP Manchester. When he retired in 2013, he returned to his first love of acting. ""I joined a few agencies to get some extras jobs on films and TV as well as to try and break into the voiceover industry. Speaking about Mould, he said: ""He is a character who exudes confidence and talks to you and convinces you that these things he's telling you are quite genuine. ""He showed me invoices, made out to himself, or Ed C Harwell, for Â£10,000 a month for the recording he had done from Amazon Books."" Mr Taylor did not get any work after giving Mould Â£1,500 and initially took that to be just another performing arts rejection. ""When something doesn't come of anything, you just put it down to experience. This was something slightly different because it was a big outlay. ""Given my background, I feel as if I should have been slightly more wary. And that's the bit I'm really ashamed of, that I should've seen through it - I just feel a fool. ""I'm sure that most of the victims of his cons thought that he was an absolutely charming fella; that's why he's so good at it I suppose."" Carl Mould said he had ""done nothing wrong"" when confronted by the BBC Audible, part of the Amazon Group, said in a statement: ""Audible is proud of its longstanding connection to the creative community and narrators are at the heart of Audible's work. ""We take this misrepresentation of us and our work very seriously. Our lawyers are contacting Sun King Media."" Ian Bayes, Midlands organiser for actors' union Equity, said it had received a number of complaints from members about Edward C Harwell and Sun King Media. ""These [complaints] have been passed on to our legal department which is currently investigating those claims. ""We always advise our members to contact the union if they are offered work but, before that work materialises, they are asked to pay an upfront fee."" The BBC understands Mould has since left his offices at the Custard Factory, which says it terminated his lease after his activities were brought to its attention. 2001 - Carl Mould was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court to three years in prison for nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception. A widow in her 80s was conned out of Â£30,000 of her life savings for poor building work on her bungalow in Carlton, Nottingham 2008 - Mould's ""Broadcast Support"" scamwas exposed by BBC Inside Out. He charged dozens of people, many of them pensioners, thousands of pounds for shoddy showreels and poor websites after claiming he could help them to get work in film or on TV 2013 - Mouldwas jailed for five yearsfor his role in a mobility aids scam in which the elderly and infirm were charged over the odds for products that often did not arrive. Mould even claimed to be a doctor at one point and escorted one elderly victim to the bank After being confronted in Birmingham and asked if he was sorry for taking money from people, Mould said: ""I'm not sorry for anything. I have not done anything wrong."" In a letter, Mould said if anyone was unhappy with the service he had provided, ""they could come back and record it again"". He added: ""We refute your claims that we target 'older', 'vulnerable' or 'retired' people as nonsense. We had an opportunity listed on a website which provides a media platform for 'current working actors'."" Peter Dickson, one of the UK's best known voiceover artists and the voice of the X Factor, who was shown the footage, said: ""This is a skill you need to learn and it takes time and practice. ""That appalling value for money he's got there is just saddening and sickening.""

"Carillion ""aggressively managed"" its balance sheet to make accounts look better, a previously unpublished report commissioned by the collapsed construction firm's board in 2017 said. The report was intended to be presented to would-be lenders but never used. However, it has now been published by a committee of MPs, whose chairman, Frank Field, said it showed ""gross failings"". Carillion, the UK's second-largest construction company, collapsed under a debt pile of Â£1.5bn on 15 January. It had employed 43,000 people, including about 20,000 in the UK. Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened The signals that the company was going bust MPs have now released a review - commissioned by Carillion in September 2017 and carried out by FTI Consulting - that was originally intended to be presented to would-be lenders. The draft independent business review said that income had been brought forward and payments postponed in order to flatter the company's accounts last year. To help with cashflow, Carillion quadrupled payment terms on its subcontractors from 30 days to four months. Some of those subcontractors now face bankruptcy. The review also highlighted another Carillion practice - compensating for its failure to turn reported profits into cash by taking on further debt. It said: ""Rather than addressing the underlying challenges facing the group in respect of problem contracts and the strength of the balance sheet, transactions were entered into, and accounting treatments and assumptions made, to enhance the reported profitability and net debt position of the group."" The report was unpublished until now, because Carillion bosses deemed its findings as ""too harsh"". Veteran Labour MP Mr Field said the report showed the ""gross failings of corporate governance and accounting"" at Carillion. A total of 1,371 Carillion workers have been made redundant since the company went into liquidation in January. Since then the work and pensions and business, energy and industrial strategy committees have been examining how and why the firm collapsed. Last week, MPs launched a fresh attack on Carillion's management, saying there was a ""wholly deficient"" corporate culture at the collapsed construction giant. The work and pensions and business, energy and industrial strategy committees said new evidence submitted to their joint inquiry into the spectacular demise of the firm revealed ""pervasive institutional failings"". The committees published extracts from a presentation made to Carillion's board last August, which included comments such as a lack of professionalism and expertise and a culture of non-compliance. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business committee, said: ""Directors didn't just drop the ball once, they made a habit of it.""

The committees published extracts from a presentation made to Carillion's board last August, which included comments such as a lack of professionalism and expertise and a culture of non-compliance. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business committee, said: ""Directors didn't just drop the ball once, they made a habit of it.""

"Syria's Eastern Ghouta region has been besieged by pro-government forces for five years Pro-government forces in Syria have reportedly recaptured about 10% of the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says fighting on the ground intensified there on Saturday. Rebels responded by shelling nearby Damascus. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the Eastern Ghouta, which has been besieged by the government since 2013. Food and medical stocks are dwindling, and aid trucks are unable to get in. The UN called for a 30-day ceasefire in Syria to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations Syria's military says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. But it has also been accused of targeting civilians. More than 640 people have been killed since 18 February, more than 150 of them children, AFP news agency reports. More than 100 civilians have died since the UN Security Council called for a 30-day ceasefire a week ago.UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said the local population is living in ""hell on earth"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes A daily five-hour ""humanitarian pause"" ordered by Russia, the Syrian government's ally, has failed to stop the bloodshed. Moscow has offered civilians in the Eastern Ghouta safe passage during the pauses, but the Syrian Observatory says none have departed since Tuesday. Russia's military said in a statement that no civilians had used the prescribed exit route on Saturday. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space 'My daughter is losing her hair from fear' Why is there a war in Syria? In northern Syria, on a different front of the country's seven-year civil war, Turkey says it has captured a Kurdish town in the northern region of Afrin. At least 36 pro-Syrian government troops - sent to support Kurdish forces - are said to have died in a Turkish air strike. Turkey launched a military offensive in the area six weeks ago to clear it of Kurdish militia, who it views as terrorists.

"Antonio Russo, his father Raffaele and cousin Vincenzo disappeared on 31 January Mexican authorities have launched criminal proceedings against four police officers over the disappearance of three Italian men. The missing men - all from Naples - were last seen on 31 January in TecalitlÃ¡n, in the western state of Jalisco. The state's governor said the officers had confessed to handing the Italians over to a local criminal gang. The police had allegedly arrested them at a petrol station beforehand. Raffaele Russo, 60, his 25-year-old son Antonio, and his nephew, Vincenzo Cimmino, 29, had stopped at a petrol station in TecalitlÃ¡n, an agricultural town. The last relatives back in Italy heard from them was a Whatsapp message from Mr Russo saying they had been approached by police officers who arrived on cycles and in a van. The police told them to follow them, according to the message. The son of one of the disappeared earlier told Italian radio that the men had been ""sold to a gang for â¬43"" ($53; Â£38), but regional officials said they could not confirm that information. The area is controlled by the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful criminal gangs. Four police, including a female officer, have been detained and charged. The Mexican authorities say three more police are being sought in connection with the disappearance. Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Gang arrests fail to drive down violence Following the trio's disappearance, the town's entire police force was sent for retraining, although some local media speculated that they were sent away so that they could not be intimidated by local cartel members into changing their story. TecalitlÃ¡n lies in territory controlled by one of Mexico's most powerful criminal gangs It is not absolutely clear, but reports say they were there to sell Chinese merchandise. Jalisco State Prosecutor RaÃºl SÃ¡nchez said he had information showing the three were selling cheap generators and agricultural machinery which they passed off as high-quality branded goods. Relatives in their home town denied the three were doing anything illegal in Mexico. A government crackdown on drug cartels since 2006 led to fragmentation, internal conflicts and new groups forming The cartel was founded when Milenio Cartel, originally a branch of Sinaloa syndicate, split It was created in 2011 in western Jalisco state and is notorious for violent attacks on security forces, including the shooting down of a government military helicopter It's led by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias El Mencho, 53. The group has fought for supremacy with Zetas Cartel in Veracruz state, leaving dozens dead It presents itself to residents in its territory as a force to rid them of other crime gangs Its interests include opium and marijuana growing, with assets estimated in the billions of dollars Read more on organised crime in Mexico,external Mexican media have drawn parallels between this case and that of43 Mexican students who disappeared from the town of Iguala in 2014. The state prosecutor in that case said that the students were handed by corrupt local police to a criminal gang, who killed them and burned their bodies. Local police, who are poorly trained and poorly paid, are often threatened or bribed by criminal gangs to turn a blind eye or even do their bidding. For that reason, federal authorities often send federal police forces and even soldiers to the most violent areas. Most visits to the country are trouble free, but violent crime and gang activity pose a risk in certain areas. Last month, the US state department warned tourists to ""completely avoid"" five states because of rampant crime levels. Colima, Guerrero, MichoacÃ¡n, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas are classified as a level-four risk, the highest in the scale, and the same as countries such as Iraq and Syria. The state department says tourists should avoid driving at night, be extra vigilant when using ATMs and avoid wearing expensive jewellery. The UK Foreign Office says tourists should research their destination thoroughly before travelling because violence is concentrated in specific areas. It says drug-related violence is a problem in Jalisco, where the three missing men were last seen. The Foreign Office also says kidnapping is a risk, and there have been allegations of police involvement. It advises tourists to be discreet about discussing financial affairs in public and to inform relatives and friends of your travel plans.

"Smith took over the Doctor's sonic screwdriver in 2010 Actor Matt Smith has revealed he nearly turned down his career-making role as the 11th Doctor in Doctor Who. Speaking onDesert Island Discs, Smith said he had had ""a wobble"" after being told he'd be David Tennant's successor. ""I was like, 'I don't think I'm going to do it',"" he told BBC Radio 4.

During the interview, he also recalled seeing tattoos of his face on the flesh of dedicated ""Whovians"", one of whom had ""me and David [Tennant] on both thighs"". Smith described Jodie Whittaker as ""a brilliant choice"" to play the sci-fi drama'sfirst female Doctor. ""The show relies on big, broad, creative brushstrokes,"" the actor continued. ""It's brilliant, it's high time and she'll be sensational."" Smith appeared alongside Claire Foy in Netflix drama The Crown Smith said he had not given Whittaker any advice but admitted in the interview that playing the Doctor had sometimes been an ordeal. ""It's the hardest thing you'll ever do in your life,"" he said, citing the ""gargantuan number of lines"" as a major factor. Smith also revealed he had been ""thinking about kids quite a lot"" recently and that he'd ""like a lot of them"". ""A lot of my friends are having children,"" he told Young.

"John McDonnell has urged the government to ensure that the Spring Statement offers help to local councils that are struggling financially. Mr McDonnell said: ""Tories are bizarrely saying they will pass up an opportunity this month to act."" He warned that councils in England are facing bankruptcy due to what he called the government's ""failed policy of austerity"". Chancellor Philip Hammond will deliver the Spring Statement on 13 March. A recent surveysuggested that 80% of England councils feared for their finances. In his speech in Southampton on Saturday, Mr McDonnell highlighted reported comments by Surrey County Council leader David Hodges - a Conservative - who said the authority faced ""the most difficult financial crisis in our history"". Mr Hodges also reportedly urged the government not to ""stand idly by while Rome burns"". Surrey County Council spans the chancellor's constituency of Runnymede & Weybridge. John McDonnell said: ""If his own Tory council leader doesn't trust his main economic policy, why should anyone else in the country?"" Mr McDonnell accused the government of trying to play down the Spring Statement by refusing to publish ""any major documents"" and moving the statement from its usual slot. A Treasury spokesman outlined the plans tothe Financial Times,externalfor the statement which, unlike most recent Budgets and Autumn statements, is being delivered on a Tuesday rather than taking the high profile slot straight after Prime Minister's Questions on a Wednesday. A spokesman for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""As part of our local government finance settlement we are delivering a real terms increase in resources to councils over the next two years, more freedom and fairness, and greater certainty to plan and secure value for money.""

"Plas-y-Dderwen residents hope to make a scarf measuring 1190ft in total. Residents at a care home in Carmarthen have been knitting a giant scarf - long enough to wrap around their home. They are knitting the scarf to raise money for a mobile sensory unit that will be used by residents with dementia. The scarf is hoped to wrap around the Plas-y-Dderwen bungalow, which measures 363m (1,190ft). Once finished, it will be made into blankets to give to residents and charities. Plas-y-Dderwen activity co-ordinator said Janet Williams: ""It was an activity to get the residents talking really. ""We've learnt so much about our residents doing this; we learnt that one resident used to write a column for the Dairy Farmer, and one man, whose daughter also joins in, used to knit string vests for the Army."" She added: ""One lady, who normally stays in her room, has joined in with the group, and now comes to knit even when the group isn't on."" Once the scarf is finished, the housekeeper will sew pieces together to make blankets, with some going to the residents and other blankets being donated to Save the Children and Oxfam.

"This video can not be played Passenger Robert Luther described how everyone was pretty cold and miserable Passengers were stuck for up to 14 hours when at least three trains ground to a halt as freezing conditions hit lines in the New Forest in Hampshire. But what is it like to be one of the unlucky few, spending the night in a cold carriage full of strangers with no way out? Robert Luther was among about 100 passengers on a five-carriage train which left London Waterloo bound for Weymouth early on Thursday evening. The electric train ground to a halt near New Milton, Hampshire, due to ice on the conductor rail. With the line blocked, other services backed up. The situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. ""A chap had a packet of biscuits - people shared what they've got. ""It's fortunate people had winter clothing - it looked like we were going on ski trip. We haven't had fresh water or heating since 8-9pm. ""The toilet pans were full up and we couldn't get off the train either. ""It shouldn't happen in this day and age, it's not as if we've got three-foot of snow on the tracks."" They were eventually rescued at about 08:00 GMT on Friday. Passengers posted pictures on social media showing their frustrations Phillip Brown, who was travelling home from London on a 17:05 South Western Railway service said: ""It prevents you from sleeping when you get that cold, so it was a case of walking up and down to get some temperature back and keep warm. ""People were taking it in their stride, but I felt sorry for the guard and the driver. They weren't getting any information."" Phillip Brown was given a free bottle of water when he eventually arrived at Bournemouth station after 14 hours on the train Harold Hanna, from Barton on Sea, was stuck with 50 other passengers on the line between Sway and New Milton. He said that, despite the chilly conditions, he had made some new friends as the ""Dunkirk spirit"" flourished among his fellow passengers. Others posted pictures on social media showing them trying to bed down for the night. Passengers tried to bed down for the night Martin Hemmingway was stuck on a CrossCountry train and had an altogether different experience. ""CrossCountry were brilliant,"" he said. We were fed and watered and warm through the night, I've nothing but praise for them. The staff were wonderful."" A 'rescue train' picked up stranded passengers South Western Railway issued a statement earlier apologising to passengers. It said: ""Passengers will be taken to Bournemouth station where we have staff waiting to give them hot food and drinks."" The firm said it ""sincerely apologised"" to the stranded passengers and organised a train to rescue them. The company said it would be closing down its service by 20:00 GMT on Friday and urged people not to attempt to travel. Fire crews made it to one of the trains to check on passengers before they were taken off.

"The explosion destroyed a Polish supermarket and the flat above it Three men have been charged with manslaughter and arson over an explosion in Leicester that left five people dead, say police. Three members of the same family died when the shop and flat were destroyed last Sunday. Five people were also taken to hospital after the blast, one of whom suffered critical injuries. Aram Kurd, of Leicester, Hawkar Hassan, of Coventry, and Arkan Ali, of Oldham, are due in court on Monday. Two other men, both from East Anglia and who were arrested on Friday, remain in custody and are continuing to be questioned by detectives. The blast happened at a Polish supermarket in the city's Hinckley Road just after 19:00 GMT. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the shop. Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean (left) and Shane (right) were among the five victims Sean and Shane Ragoobeer, along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time, were officially named on Friday as among the dead. The fifth body is still to be formally identified but is believed to be Ms Ragoobar. Mr Kurd, 33, of Hillary Place, Mr Hassan, 32, of Eld Road, and Mr Ali, 37, of Drake Close, will be held in police custody over the weekend before appearing before Leicester magistrates on Monday, police said.

"""And the winner is... La La Land!"" Somehow,that moment- and the subsequent revelation that Moonlight had, in fact, won the Oscar for best picture was a whole year ago. But an awful lot can change in Hollywood in a single year. Here are eight things that will be different about the 90th Academy Awards - and what to look out for at Sunday's ceremony. Oscars 2018: Full coverage,external Expect envelope jokes. Lots of them. That said, host Jimmy Kimmel already got a few quips out of the way in thetrailer for this year's show, co-starring with Warren Beatty, who washanded the wrong envelopeat last year's ceremony. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm which has beenin charge of counting Oscar votes(and looking after those all-important envelopes) for the past 84 years is, perhaps unsurprisingly,making a few changes. The employees previously responsible for handing the golden envelopes to the presenters, Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan, have been replaced, although they do still work for the company. This year, in addition to the two accountants who sit either side of the stage with a full set of envelopes, a third person will be situated in the show's control room. They will also commit the winners to memory. All three will attend rehearsals and practice what to do if anything goes wrong. Each presenter, and a stage manager, will have to confirm they've been handed the correct envelope for the category they are announcing. The problem last year was that Beatty was given the best actress envelope, when that award had already been presented to Emma Stone PwC employees are banned from using mobile phones and social media while the ceremony is going on. Last year,Cullinan had been posting on Twitterjust before the mix-up. It's traditional for the previous year's best actor winner to announce who has won best actress - and vice versa. ButCasey Affleck, who won the award for Manchester by the Sea, has pulled out of presenting duties. He was sued by two female crew members for alleged sexual harassment in 2010.Affleck denied the allegations, and the lawsuits were settled out of court. The best actress winner will instead be announced by former winners Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence. Daniela Vega will be among the presenters at the ceremony A diverse line-up of presenters has been chosen to actually hand out the Oscars. They include Tiffany Haddish, Gina Rodriguez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Lupita Nyong'o. And Daniela Vega is also making history. She is believed to be the first openly transgender actress to present at the Academy Awards. Vega is the star of Chile's best foreign film nominee A Fantastic Woman. Others presenting include Jodie Foster, Mark Hamill, Greta Gerwig, Helen Mirren, Tom Holland, Gal Gadot, Laura Dern and Zendaya. This video can not be played Five ways women made a mark in the Oscar nominations Women are still under-represented amongst the Oscar nominees, but some important steps have been made. Rachel Morrison has become the first womanto ever (yes, ever) be nominated as best cinematographer. She's honoured for her work on Dee Rees' Mudbound, which starred Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige. And then there's the fact that Greta Gerwig is the fifth woman to ever (yes, ever) be nominated in the best director category, for her debut Lady Bird. Several films in the best picture category are notable too for being centred around women, without romance being the main focus of the plot. That includes films like Lady Bird, a coming of age story set in early 2000s Sacramento, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, about a grieving mother's fight for justice. The first Academy Awards were held on 16 May, 1929 - but two nominees for the 2018 Oscars were born the previous year. James Ivory, nominated for best adapted screenplay for Call Me By Your Name, was born on 7 June, 1928 and Agnes Varda, nominated for best documentary for Faces Places, on 30 May, 1928. If either wins, they will also be the oldest-ever Oscar winners. It's worth noting, too, that best supporting actor nominee Christopher Plummer, given a nod for his role in All the Money in the World, is the oldest ever actor nominated for a competitive award. At the time of writing, it's not expected that there will be a Golden Globes-style black out on the red carpet  - with everyone wearing monochromatic outfits. But it's likely the massive political earthquake that has hit Hollywood in the past year will be represented not just on the red carpet but throughout the ceremony. Stars will potentially arrive holding white roses - as happened at the Grammys and Brit Awards. Watch out, too, for celebrities bringing activists as their guests on the red carpet, rather than their significant other (or their mum). This is what happened at the Globes, with Emma Watson among those using their moment in the spotlight to make a stand against sexual harassment. Will host Jimmy Kimmel make a reference to Harvey Weinstein? It's been suggested that Harvey Weinstein is the most thanked man in Oscars history, with several best actor and actress winners through the years giving him a name check. His firm was also responsible for best picture winners like Shakespeare in Love and The King's Speech. And just as his presence has been very much felt in previous years, so will his absence this year, after the sexual abuse scandal that erupted at the end of 2017. (Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex). Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel may - or may not - choose to address the issue in his opening monologue. If he does, he'd be following Globes host Seth Meyers who tackled what he called ""the elephant not in the room"" at the January ceremony. Daniel Kaluuya won the Bafta Rising Star award - could Get Out also win best picture? Which makes guessing who's going to win a little bit trickier. At the moment, it seems to be a two-horse race between The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri for the best picture title. But the experts' opinion on who's going to win seems to change every day. There are also murmurings that Get Out, starring British actor Daniel Kaluuya, is gathering momentum. Then again, some think Dunkirk could be the shock winner. It's also notable that the nominated films have had the lowest grosses in six years. Some have suggested this represents a growing gap between what the movie-going public actually watches, and what wins the gongs. One last thing to mention: This year's ceremony is later than usual, due to the Winter Olympics. It's being held at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre on Sunday, 4 March, starting at 17:00 local time.

"This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains At least 36 pro-Syrian government troops have been killed by a Turkish air strike in the region of Afrin, a monitoring group says. The strike targeted a camp at Kafr Jina in the northern Syrian region, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The pro-government troops entered Afrin two weeks ago to back Kurdish forces. They are fighting a Turkish military offensive that was launched to clear Kurdish groups from Afrin. Turkey considers the Kurdish militiamen there terrorists. The Syrian government has denounced the offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty and, according to state media, forces were sent in to support the Kurds. Why is Turkey targeting Kurdish forces? How Afrin became a prize worth a war The air strike followed one of the bloodiest days for Turkish troops since they began the offensive in January. Eight Turkish soldiers were killed and another 13 were injured on Thursday in fighting in Afrin. Five ""heroic comrades fell as martyrs and seven were wounded"", an initial statement from Turkey's military said. A second statement announced three more soldiers had been killed and six more wounded. No official details of the clashes were given but the private Dogan news agency said Kurdish fighters used tunnels to ambush Turkish special forces in the Keltepe district. A Turkish helicopter sent in to rescue the wounded was hit and had to turn back, the report added. Thousands of civilians in Afrin have fled their homes since Turkey's offensive began. The Turkish government says the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links to the PKK. Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Neither side has released much information about fatalities, making the death toll in Afrin difficult to gauge. The UK-based SOHR says more than 141 civilians have died but Turkey denies this, saying only combatants are targeted. Last month,Amnesty International said indiscriminate shelling had killed scores of civilians in Afrin. Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor When pro-government militia forces edged into Afrin last month, it wasn't clear what their strategic purpose would be. Videos showed a small group of militiamen being welcomed to Afrin city by Kurds there as their saviours. But it didn't seem likely that they would play much more than a symbolic role, allowing the Syrian government to vaunt a new territorial initiative but at no major risk. In fact, it seemed that it might be a way of de-escalating the latest conflict in Syria after Turkey launched its operation against Kurdish fighters there. A deal to allow the Syrian government to take over much of the control of the area might suit many of the parties involved. It might even be a less bad option for Turkey, allowing it to turn down the intensity of its offensive. But if the reports are true that pro-government forces have been badly hit by Turkish airstrikes, that would appear to undercut this interpretation, raising the prospect of yet another new flashpoint in Syria.

"Syria's Eastern Ghouta region has been besieged by pro-government forces for five years Pro-government forces in Syria have reportedly recaptured about 10% of the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says fighting on the ground intensified there on Saturday. Rebels responded by shelling nearby Damascus. Some 393,000 people are trapped in the Eastern Ghouta, which has been besieged by the government since 2013. Food and medical stocks are dwindling, and aid trucks are unable to get in. The UN called for a 30-day ceasefire in Syria to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations Syria's military says it is trying to liberate the region, one of the last rebel strongholds, from those it terms terrorists. But it has also been accused of targeting civilians. More than 640 people have been killed since 18 February, more than 150 of them children, AFP news agency reports. More than 100 civilians have died since the UN Security Council called for a 30-day ceasefire a week ago.UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said the local population is living in ""hell on earth"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes A daily five-hour ""humanitarian pause"" ordered by Russia, the Syrian government's ally, has failed to stop the bloodshed. Moscow has offered civilians in the Eastern Ghouta safe passage during the pauses, but the Syrian Observatory says none have departed since Tuesday. Russia's military said in a statement that no civilians had used the prescribed exit route on Saturday. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space 'My daughter is losing her hair from fear' Why is there a war in Syria? In northern Syria, on a different front of the country's seven-year civil war, Turkey says it has captured a Kurdish town in the northern region of Afrin. At least 36 pro-Syrian government troops - sent to support Kurdish forces - are said to have died in a Turkish air strike. Turkey launched a military offensive in the area six weeks ago to clear it of Kurdish militia, who it views as terrorists.

"A state-of-the-art MRI scan could reduce a man's prostate cancer diagnosis by weeks The NHS plans to cut prostate cancer diagnosis times from six weeks to a matter of days, NHS England has said. Typically a test for men with prostate cancer requires an MRI scan and a biopsy where a dozen samples are taken, requiring multiple hospital visits. But a ""one-stop"" service will be trialled in three west London hospitals which hopes to complete all the necessary tests in one day. NHS England CEO Simon Stevens said the programme was ""world-leading"". A type of MRI scan, known as an mpMRI, provides higher quality imagery and provides up to 40% of patients with a a same day diagnosis. For people who need a biopsy, ultrasound images with 3D MRI scans are used to target areas for taking tissue samples. The NHS claims the technique virtually eliminates the threat of sepsis. The technique is being trialled at Charing Cross Hospital, Epsom Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, where about 5,000 men will be tested over the next two years. Imperial College London chairman of urology Professor Hashim Ahmed said: ""Fast access to high-quality prostate MRI allows many men to avoid invasive biopsies as well as allowing precision biopsy in those men requiring it to find high risk tumours much earlier."" ""What we are hoping to do is show the NHS that this can be done, that it can be done cost-effectively and that we can improve the outcomes for men in a much better way than we were doing."" Mr Stevens said: ""This is an encouraging breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis that is genuinely world-leading. ""While still early days, the potential benefit to men with suspected cancer is significant."" Consultant radiologist Dr Anthony Chambers said that although he wished the researchers well he had reservations as to whether carrying out the mpMRI and biopsy on the same day was the right way forward. He said this could lead to an over-investigation of men who have a common infection called prostatitis rather than prostate cancer.
