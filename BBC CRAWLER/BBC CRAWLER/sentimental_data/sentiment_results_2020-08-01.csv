"Barakah: The start-up was originally scheduled to happen in 2017 The United Arab Emirates has launched operations at the Arab world's first nuclear power plant, on the Gulf coast just east of Qatar. Nuclear fission has begun in one of four reactors at the Barakah plant, which uses South Korean technology. The plant was due to open in 2017 but start-up was delayed for what officials said were safety requirements. The oil-rich UAE wants Barakah to meet a quarter of its energy needs, as it adopts more sustainable energy sources. Just two weeks ago the UAE senta probe on a mission to Mars- another high-profile scientific first for the Gulf nation. The UAE is also investing heavily in solar power - a plentiful energy source in the Gulf. Some energy experts question the logic of Barakah, arguing that solar power is cleaner, cheaper and makes more sense in a region plagued by political tensions and terrorism. Last year Qatar called the Barakah plant a ""flagrant threat to regional peace and environment"". Qatar is a bitter regional rival of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Across the Gulf lies Iran, hostile to the UAE, and subject to US sanctions because of its controversial nuclear programme. Iran admits extensive fire damage at nuclear site Climate change: Is nuclear power the answer? Dr Paul Dorfman, head of the international Nuclear Consulting Group, wrote last year that ""the tense geopolitical environment in the Gulf makes nuclear a more controversial issue in this region than elsewhere, as new nuclear power provides the capability to develop and make nuclear weapons"". The London-based scientist also highlighted the risk of radioactive pollution in the Gulf. In a statement the plant's developer the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) said it was committed to the ""highest standards of safety and security"" and that the plant would play an important role diversifying and decarbonising the economy. ""The Barakah plant will supply clean baseload electricity to the grid - complementing intermittent renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind, which are not able to generate electricity on a continuous basis,"" it said. ""It will provide up to 25% of the UAE's electricity needs once fully operational and will help prevent the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 3.2 millions cars off the road annually."" This photo, tweeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, shows staff shortly after start up UAE leaders hailed the start-up on Saturday as a symbol of the country's scientific progress. The Barakah plant was developed by ENEC and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Energy will be generated by 1,400-megawatt pressurised water reactors, designed in South Korea, called APR-1400. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the nuclear industry's main oversight body -praised Barakah in a tweet,external, saying the plant's Unit 1 had ""achieved its first criticality"" - that is, generation of a controlled fission chain reaction. ""This is an important milestone towards commercial operations and generating clean energy. IAEA has been supporting [United Arab Emirates] from the beginning of its nuclear power programme."" The leader of Abu Dhabi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,tweeted his congratulations,external""marking this milestone in the roadmap for sustainable development"".

"This video can not be played Coronavirus in South Africa: A day in the life of a contact tracer More than half a million coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Africa, according to the country's health minister. Zweli Mkhize announced 10,107 new cases on Saturday, bringing the tally to 503,290, along with 8,153 deaths. South Africa is the hardest-hit country on the continent and accounts for half of all reported infections in Africa. It also has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world after the US, Brazil, Russia and India. Researchers have said the true number of deaths in the country may be far higher. South African health authorities have said the rate of infection is increasing rapidly, with cases currently concentrated around the capital, Pretoria. Coronavirus in SA: Why things are going both right and wrong South Africa's outbreak: Eight lessons for the rest of the continent How fast is coronavirus spreading in Africa? More than a third of all infections have been reported in Gauteng,external- South Africa's financial hub, and a province that has quickly become the epicentre of the national outbreak. Infections are not expected to peak for another month. Responding to the new figures, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on citizens to remain vigilant. ""We have to continue to work together to reduce the number of new infections. As with many other countries across the world, we need to continually adjust the measures we take to prevent new outbreaks or to safeguard our health system"", he said. South Africa imposed a strict lockdown in April and May that slowed the spread of the coronavirus. South Africa is grappling with the largest outbreak on the continent It began a gradual reopening in June but restrictions - including a ban on alcohol sales - were reintroduced last month as infection rates began to rise again. A state of emergency is also in force until 15 August. By Lucy Fleming, BBC News The president tried to highlight the positive as South Africa reached its grim milestone in the battle against coronavirus. He pointed to a recovery rate of 68% and said the number of deaths was ""significantly lower than the global average"". But experts warn to be wary of statistics given the different criteria and methods used by different provinces - and comparisons with African countries where there has low levels of testing. Mr Ramaphosa said the lockdown had prevented the health system from becoming initially overwhelmed and the suspension of alcohol sales had significantly reduced the number of trauma cases in hospitals Yet even with such strict restrictions - it has been mandatory, for example, to wear face masks in public since May - social distancing is often impossible in South Africa's densely packed townships, where the virus has been quick to spread during the winter season. The president's comments about investigations into allegations of corruption over the procurement of medical supplies - some alleged to implicate his own aides - perhaps underline the crux of the problems facing the country's health system. ""It is unconscionable that there are people who may be using this health crisis to unlawfully enrich themselves,"" he said. The influx of patients has put an incredible strain on South Africa's hospitals, anda BBC investigation found an array of systematic failuresthat had exhausted healthcare professionals and brought the health service near to collapse. President Ramaphosa said last month that 28,000 hospital beds had been made available for Covid-19 patients but the country still faced a ""serious"" shortage of doctors and nurses. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health Last week the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that South Africa's experience was a likely a precursor to what would happen across the rest of the continent. So far African countries have generally reported low death rates per capita compared to other parts of the world. The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in Africa - more than 60% are under the age of 25. Covid-19 is known to have a higher mortality rate for older age groups.

"More than two million people shielding against coronavirus in most of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can now leave their home and return to work. Vulnerable people were advised in March to stay at home, or shield, to avoid contracting Covid-19. In Wales the advice stays in place until 16 August. But Macmillan Cancer Support said people in the shielded group do not feel safe enough to leave their homes. It comes after the PM applied the brakes to easing restrictions further. Meanwhile, Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government,has said England could have to consider closing pubs in order to reopen schoolsin September. And businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic mustnow start contributingto the government's job retention scheme. Analysis: We're at the limit of easing lockdown At-a-glance: What can I do now? Do people still have to shield? Young shielders: I've never felt so isolated Those who have been shielding since March include people in high-risk categories, such as those who have had an organ transplant, are receiving immunosuppressant drugs, undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have severe respiratory conditions. Now, they can return to work if they cannot work from home and as long as their workplace is Covid-secure. It is still advised they maintain social distancing when outside. From Saturday, those who were shielding in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will no longer receive food boxes and medicine deliveries from the government. This video can not be played Kirsty Young has been shielding for the past four months But shielding advice remains in place for Blackburn with Darwen in the north-west of England, Leicester and Luton, and the most vulnerable will continue to shield in Wales for another two weeks. Eve Byrne from Macmillan Cancer Support said the organisation had written to the government over concerns shielders are having to ""make the impossible choice"" between their health and their job. ""People in the shielded group are telling us that they are just not feeling safe,"" she told the BBC, adding that the government needs to ensure the necessary protections are in place for people returning to work. This video can not be played ""It's helping me deal with my cancer,"" said Michelle Teale after seeing her mother Michelle Teale, from Leicester, saw her mum on Saturday for the first time in 22 weeks. Michelle has been shielding because she has secondary breast cancer. ""I can't get into words just how excited I feel today and how tough it's been, not being able to physically see her,"" she said. She took a bottle of champagne for them both to enjoy as well as some flowers for her mum. ""It feels strange, like going on holiday for the day. I feel excited but I'm also nervous"". However, other people who have been shielding say they will continue to do so. Norah Grant, who has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and leads a support group for people under 60 with the condition, says the decision to end shielding was ""very odd just considering everything that is happening in Manchester and all around"". ""I don't think I will be changing my habits,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that she will be able to work from home in one of her two jobs. ""A lot of people in our [support] group are very nervous about going back to work,"" she said. Sara Swanson, who has an immune deficiency which means she cannot produce antibodies, said she would also continue to shield. ""I really don't think it is safe,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people not following the rules."" On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - would be postponed for at least a fortnight. It means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close-contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion ofwedding receptionsto allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said he supported the government's decisions on shielding and the lockdown restrictions. But he told BBC Breakfast the ""way in which the [lockdown] announcement was communicated"" on Thursday night, ""sort of dribbling out"" without all the detail, ""has caused a degree of confusion and anxiety"". The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in areas including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshireafter a spike in virus cases. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played Highlights: Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 to win FA Cup Arsenal's talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang worked his Wembley magic once again as they came from behind to beat Chelsea and win the FA Cup for a record 14th time. Chelsea took the lead in theHeads Up FA Cup finalinside five minutes through Christian Pulisic's smart finish but then fell victim to the brilliance of Aubameyang, who was also Arsenal's hero when he scored twice in the semi-final win over Manchester City. The Gabon forward drew Arsenal level from the penalty spot before the break after he was fouled by Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, then produced a moment of world-class finishing to make the defining contribution to the first behind-closed-doors FA Cup final. Chelsea were hampered by a first-half injury to Azpilicueta and were struggling even further when they lost the outstanding Pulisic to a hamstring problem after the break. As the Blues battled to overcome those setbacks, the brilliant Aubameyang was able to give Mikel Arteta silverware in his first season as the Gunners' manager. Aubameyang, who Arsenal are understandably desperate to secure on a new long-term contract, turned Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma inside out in the 67th minute before delivering the most audacious finish, chipping over keeper Willy Caballero from an angle. Chelsea's agony increased further when Mateo Kovacic was very harshly sent off for a second yellow card, awarded by referee Anthony Taylor for the most innocuous of challenges on Granit Xhaka. Arsenal closed out the win to secure a place in the Europa League next season but it was bitter disappointment for Chelsea manager Frank Lampard at the conclusion of his first campaign in charge. Reaction from Wembley as Arsenal beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final 'Aubameyang would cost zillions to replace' Arsenal v Chelsea: How you rated the players 'We got complacent' - Chelsea boss Lampard 'We can win titles together' - Arteta This video can not be played 'I can't even talk' - Martinez in tears after FA Cup win Arteta's delight at the final whistle was obvious as he secured his first major trophy as a manager, having only succeeded Unai Emery in December. There have been some mixed moments - but in recent weeks, Arsenal have shown their development by defeating new Premier League champions Liverpool and ending Manchester City's hopes of retaining the FA Cup by beating them to reach the final. Now the Gunners have the trophy in their hands after seeing off Chelsea. In each game they have shown character, courage and resilience - all qualities they have regularly been accused of lacking - and have a world-class spearhead in Aubameyang. A player of that calibre makes the difference in the big games. Aubameyang has shown that, making Wembley his personal playground in both the semi-final and the final. It may have been a surreal occasion, this FA Cup final played in a virtually deserted Wembley and missing so much of the traditional ceremony and atmosphere, but the joy of victory was still relished by Arteta and his players and rightly so. And when the celebrations end, Arsenal will know with even more certainty what their summer priority must be, even above any acquisitions. Arsenal must find a way to keep Aubameyang. Their cause is helped by being able to offer him European football, albeit the Europa League rather than the Champions League. He is quite simply a talent that gives Arsenal another dimension of danger. He is a match-winner - and in this instance, an FA Cup final winner. This video can not be played Aubameyang drops...then lifts the FA Cup It all started so well for Chelsea and Lampard as they dominated the opening phases at Wembley and led through Pulisic's goal. The momentum changed after the first-half drinks break as Chelsea were undone by their own injuries, Arsenal's vast improvement and the dismissal of Kovacic. Chelsea lost the experience of Azpilicueta and the thrilling talent of Pulisic, who actually injured his hamstring as he raced in on goal with a very good chance, and were then fighting an uphill battle. They tried to regain that earlier supremacy but were hit by that brilliant goal from Aubameyang and the sending off of Kovacic. The Croatia international was shown a second yellow card for a challenge with Xhaka that raised questions as to whether it was actually a foul before referee Anthony Taylor eventually produced the red card. It more or less signalled the end of Chelsea's hopes. Lampard's first season, which has contained so much promise, concludes with a place in next season's Champions League but not a trophy. There has been much to admire from Chelsea as Lampard has mixed youth and experience but there is a defensive frailty he must address, having added to his attacking resources with the exciting addition of Timo Werner. Those defensive weaknesses were clear as Aubameyang preyed on them in deadly fashion. As they trooped to collect their losers' medals, Chelsea and Lampard will reflect on a day when little went right after that opening five minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang once again showed his value to Arsenal as he inspired them to their first major trophy since 2017 Mikel Arteta has become the first person to both captain and manage Arsenal to victory in an FA Cup final. Chelsea have lost three of their past 10 FA Cup final matches, with all three defeats coming against Arsenal. The Gunners have won each of their past seven FA Cup final appearances since 2002 - no team has had a longer run of successive final triumphs in the competition. Arteta is the first Arsenal manager to win a major trophy in their first season in charge of the club since George Graham in 1986-87. There was just one shot on target in the whole of the second half, which was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's winning goal. Since his debut for Arsenal in February 2018, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 70 goals in all competitions, more than any other Premier League player in that time. Christian Pulisic's opener was the first FA Cup final goal scored by an American player. Mateo Kovacic became the sixth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final, with the last two of them being Chelsea players (Victor Moses was dismissed, also against Arsenal, in 2017). Willy Caballero (38 years 308 days) became the oldest player to play for Chelsea in an FA Cup final, while substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi (19 years 268 days) became the youngest to play in the showpiece for the Blues.

Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held further talks on Saturday Senior US Democrats say they ""not close yet"" to clinching a deal with the White House over the latest Covid-19 relief package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that a three-hour meeting on Saturday was ""more productive than the other meetings"".

But he added: ""There are
many issues that are still very much outstanding."" He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House
Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol. Negotiations have focused on an extension of the $600 (Â£458) per week federal
unemployment benefits.

In April, Congress passed aCovid-19 relief package totalling $484bn (Â£391bn), which was the fourth aid bill in response to the pandemic.

Four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England - so not including deaths in care homes or the wider community, according to the NHS. This brings the total number to 29,342. The four patients were aged between 78 and 84. All had underlying health conditions.  The WTA said the tournament would go ahead as planned An unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus shortly before the start of the Palermo Ladies Open - an event that marks the return of professional tennis for the first time since March. The player, who was showing no symptoms of coronavirus, has withdrawn from the contest. The Women's Tennis Association said the tournament would still go ahead as planned, adding that anyone who had come into contact with the player would undergo testing. In June, a number of players contracted coronavirus whiletaking part in the Adria Tour event,organised by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic apologised, saying it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. Read more about the Palermo Open coronavirus case here. Will GrantMexico and Central America correspondent for BBC News Seeing Mexico rise to the third-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world reflects just how bad most Mexicans feel the situation in their country is. Surpassing the UK in that classification, Mexico has now registered 46,688 deaths linked to Covid-19, with only the US and Brazil having had more. The situation is bleak in Mexico in a number of ways. First, testing remains low with the government unconvinced of its importance. Only the most severe cases are tested and contact tracing is also poor. Furthermore, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador appears to continue to pour scorn on the use of face masks to combat the spread of the virus. His critics accuse him of taking a cavalier attitude to the virus and say his governmentâs response has been wholly inadequate. The government claims long-standing issues in Mexican society - such as high levels of diabetes and obesity - are partly the reason for the large number of cases. As we reported earlier, thousands of people gathered in the German capital Berlin to protest against the country's coronavirus restrictions today. Demonstrators argue that measures introduced during the pandemic - such as wearing face coverings - violate people's rights and freedoms. Here are some pictures of the protest,and you can find out more about it here. Thousands gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for the protest march The protest was peaceful but few people wore face masks or observed social distancing Some carried signs, bearing messages such as: ""Nobody has the right to obey"" This sign says: ""Oh man, how long shall this be going on like this?"" The UK has released its daily coronavirus figures. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:  For more on what these numbers mean and how they compare with previous days, take a look at the charts below: The beach resort city of Da Nang in Vietnam plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, Reuters news agency reports. Local authorities made the announcement as 40 new cases linked to the city were reported across the country. This brings the total number of cases in Vietnam to 586, while three deaths have been reported since Friday. Da Nang has a population of about 1.1m people. Local medical officials have conducted more than 8,000 tests since a new outbreak was detected in the city - popular with domestic tourists - on July 25. Authorities said testing capacity will now be increased to 8,000 to 10,000 per day. There will probably be a second wave of coronavirus in October in the UK and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"", a scientist advising the government says. Prof Calum Semple, who is a member of the advisory group Sage, made the comments afteranother scientific adviser saidpubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Semple, from the University of Liverpool, says whether pubs or the hospitality sector will be ""taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision."" Read the full storyhere. Struct social distancing measures were in place at the theatre Tokyo's main theatre for performances of the Japanese kabuki dance-drama has reopened, five months after it shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Strict social distancing measures were in place at the famous Kabukiza theatre, following a record number of fresh infections in the Japanese capital. The kabuki, however, was most unlike its usual self. Spectators were spaced apart and there were fewer performers on stage. The seats at the Kabukiza Theatre were disinfected They all wore black masks and a traditional part of the act - in which spectators shout out phrases towards the stage - was dropped. A member of the audience said she felt she had finally come back to life after five months of lockdown. Yet Covid-19 has not gone away. Tokyo reported 472 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - a record rise for a third successive day. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned on Friday that the city may declare an emergency to stem the spread of coronavirus. Masks are to be worn at by staff in the theatre Switzerland has marked its national day with a pyrotechnics display at a section of mountains in the Alps, wowing spectators while complying with social-distancing rules. Switzerlandâs national day is held every year on 1 August to celebrate the date of the central European nationâs founding in 1291. The day is usually celebrated with fireworks displays, but in times of social distancing, event organisers had to be creative this year. More than 100 kg (220 lbs) of magnesium powder were ignited at the mountain chains of Veisivi and Dent de Perroc on Friday night.

"India has recorded 57,000 new corona virus cases - the highest daily total to date Maharashtra - home to the financial capital, Mumbai - is still the worst affected state In the UK, shielding ends for some two million people - while further easing of restrictions in England is halted Pubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month, a leading scientist says Mexico's coronavirus death toll is now the world's third highest, with only the US and Brazil recording greater numbers The US top infectious diseases expert has said he is 'optimistic' a US-developed vaccine will be available by end of 2020 Millions of Americans are set to lose a $600 benefit after US politicians failed to agree a deal on its extension Holly Wallis and Alice Cuddy That's it for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Contributors were: Joshua Nevett, Deirdre Finnerty, Dulcie Lee, Holly Wallis, Alice Cuddy and David Walker As we approach the end of today's coronavirus live coverage, here is a recap of the main developments from the UK and around the world. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Read more from James here. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held further talks on Saturday Senior US Democrats say they ""not close yet"" to clinching a deal with the White House over the latest Covid-19 relief package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that a three-hour meeting on Saturday was ""more productive than the other meetings"".

But he added: ""There are
many issues that are still very much outstanding."" He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House
Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol. Negotiations have focused on an extension of the $600 (Â£458) per week federal
unemployment benefits.

In April, Congress passed aCovid-19 relief package totalling $484bn (Â£391bn), which was the fourth aid bill in response to the pandemic. Nick and Emily McKerrell say few firms bother to reply Job hunters in the UK are finding it increasingly hard to find work as coronavirus takes its toll on the economy. Even well-qualified candidates find they are applying for a shrinking number of roles, often many pay grades below what they are used to. BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker has been hearing first-hand from some of the country's frustrated and worried job-seekers. A World War Two Spitfire has flown over hospitals across the south of England to pay tribute to those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. The aircraft has ""THANK U NHS"" written beneath its wings, and also bears the names of thousands of heroes of the pandemic, nominated by members of the public. Organsiers have been using the Spitfire to raise money for NHS charities. It is touring hospitals around the country throughout the summer. ""The reaction from the people on the ground and the support has been amazing,"" said pilot John Romaine. Read more about NHS Spitfire.  A Wetherspoon pub in the city of Carlisle, in northern England, has temporarily closed after a member of staff tested positive for coronavirus. Twenty-four employees at the William Rufus pub are now self-isolating. A spokesman for the Wetherspoon chain said the pub would reopen ""as and when it can get the number of staff needed to do so safely."" ""Customer test and trace details have not yet been requested by the authorities but are available when needed,"" he added. Read more here. Four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England - so not including deaths in care homes or the wider community, according to the NHS. This brings the total number to 29,342. The four patients were aged between 78 and 84. All had underlying health conditions.  The WTA said the tournament would go ahead as planned An unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus shortly before the start of the Palermo Ladies Open - an event that marks the return of professional tennis for the first time since March. The player, who was showing no symptoms of coronavirus, has withdrawn from the contest. The Women's Tennis Association said the tournament would still go ahead as planned, adding that anyone who had come into contact with the player would undergo testing. In June, a number of players contracted coronavirus whiletaking part in the Adria Tour event,organised by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic apologised, saying it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. Read more about the Palermo Open coronavirus case here. Will GrantMexico and Central America correspondent for BBC News Seeing Mexico rise to the third-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world reflects just how bad most Mexicans feel the situation in their country is. Surpassing the UK in that classification, Mexico has now registered 46,688 deaths linked to Covid-19, with only the US and Brazil having had more. The situation is bleak in Mexico in a number of ways. First, testing remains low with the government unconvinced of its importance. Only the most severe cases are tested and contact tracing is also poor. Furthermore, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador appears to continue to pour scorn on the use of face masks to combat the spread of the virus. His critics accuse him of taking a cavalier attitude to the virus and say his governmentâs response has been wholly inadequate. The government claims long-standing issues in Mexican society - such as high levels of diabetes and obesity - are partly the reason for the large number of cases. As we reported earlier, thousands of people gathered in the German capital Berlin to protest against the country's coronavirus restrictions today. Demonstrators argue that measures introduced during the pandemic - such as wearing face coverings - violate people's rights and freedoms. Here are some pictures of the protest,and you can find out more about it here. Thousands gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for the protest march The protest was peaceful but few people wore face masks or observed social distancing Some carried signs, bearing messages such as: ""Nobody has the right to obey"" This sign says: ""Oh man, how long shall this be going on like this?"" The UK has released its daily coronavirus figures. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:  For more on what these numbers mean and how they compare with previous days, take a look at the charts below: The beach resort city of Da Nang in Vietnam plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, Reuters news agency reports. Local authorities made the announcement as 40 new cases linked to the city were reported across the country. This brings the total number of cases in Vietnam to 586, while three deaths have been reported since Friday. Da Nang has a population of about 1.1m people. Local medical officials have conducted more than 8,000 tests since a new outbreak was detected in the city - popular with domestic tourists - on July 25. Authorities said testing capacity will now be increased to 8,000 to 10,000 per day. There will probably be a second wave of coronavirus in October in the UK and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"", a scientist advising the government says. Prof Calum Semple, who is a member of the advisory group Sage, made the comments afteranother scientific adviser saidpubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Semple, from the University of Liverpool, says whether pubs or the hospitality sector will be ""taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision."" Read the full storyhere. Struct social distancing measures were in place at the theatre Tokyo's main theatre for performances of the Japanese kabuki dance-drama has reopened, five months after it shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Strict social distancing measures were in place at the famous Kabukiza theatre, following a record number of fresh infections in the Japanese capital. The kabuki, however, was most unlike its usual self. Spectators were spaced apart and there were fewer performers on stage. The seats at the Kabukiza Theatre were disinfected They all wore black masks and a traditional part of the act - in which spectators shout out phrases towards the stage - was dropped. A member of the audience said she felt she had finally come back to life after five months of lockdown. Yet Covid-19 has not gone away. Tokyo reported 472 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - a record rise for a third successive day. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned on Friday that the city may declare an emergency to stem the spread of coronavirus. Masks are to be worn at by staff in the theatre Switzerland has marked its national day with a pyrotechnics display at a section of mountains in the Alps, wowing spectators while complying with social-distancing rules. Switzerlandâs national day is held every year on 1 August to celebrate the date of the central European nationâs founding in 1291. The day is usually celebrated with fireworks displays, but in times of social distancing, event organisers had to be creative this year.

"Barakah: The start-up was originally scheduled to happen in 2017 The United Arab Emirates has launched operations at the Arab world's first nuclear power plant, on the Gulf coast just east of Qatar. Nuclear fission has begun in one of four reactors at the Barakah plant, which uses South Korean technology. The plant was due to open in 2017 but start-up was delayed for what officials said were safety requirements. The oil-rich UAE wants Barakah to meet a quarter of its energy needs, as it adopts more sustainable energy sources. Just two weeks ago the UAE senta probe on a mission to Mars- another high-profile scientific first for the Gulf nation. The UAE is also investing heavily in solar power - a plentiful energy source in the Gulf. Some energy experts question the logic of Barakah, arguing that solar power is cleaner, cheaper and makes more sense in a region plagued by political tensions and terrorism. Last year Qatar called the Barakah plant a ""flagrant threat to regional peace and environment"". Qatar is a bitter regional rival of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Across the Gulf lies Iran, hostile to the UAE, and subject to US sanctions because of its controversial nuclear programme. Iran admits extensive fire damage at nuclear site Climate change: Is nuclear power the answer? Dr Paul Dorfman, head of the international Nuclear Consulting Group, wrote last year that ""the tense geopolitical environment in the Gulf makes nuclear a more controversial issue in this region than elsewhere, as new nuclear power provides the capability to develop and make nuclear weapons"". The London-based scientist also highlighted the risk of radioactive pollution in the Gulf. In a statement the plant's developer the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) said it was committed to the ""highest standards of safety and security"" and that the plant would play an important role diversifying and decarbonising the economy. ""The Barakah plant will supply clean baseload electricity to the grid - complementing intermittent renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind, which are not able to generate electricity on a continuous basis,"" it said. ""It will provide up to 25% of the UAE's electricity needs once fully operational and will help prevent the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 3.2 millions cars off the road annually."" This photo, tweeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, shows staff shortly after start up UAE leaders hailed the start-up on Saturday as a symbol of the country's scientific progress. The Barakah plant was developed by ENEC and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Energy will be generated by 1,400-megawatt pressurised water reactors, designed in South Korea, called APR-1400. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the nuclear industry's main oversight body -praised Barakah in a tweet,external, saying the plant's Unit 1 had ""achieved its first criticality"" - that is, generation of a controlled fission chain reaction. ""This is an important milestone towards commercial operations and generating clean energy. IAEA has been supporting [United Arab Emirates] from the beginning of its nuclear power programme."" The leader of Abu Dhabi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,tweeted his congratulations,external""marking this milestone in the roadmap for sustainable development"".

"TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance The US general manager of TikTok has said the Chinese-owned video-sharing app is ""here for the long run"", after President Donald Trump said he would ban it in the US. Vanessa Pappas told TikTok users in a video statement that its staff were building ""the safest app"". Mr Trump said he could soon sign an executive order, amid concerns the app could be used to collect Americans' personal data. TikTok denies any Chinese control. The fast-growing app has up to 80 million active monthly users in the US and the ban would be a major blow for the Chinese firm ByteDance which owns it. It was not immediately clear what authority Mr Trump has to ban TikTok, how that ban would be enforced and what legal challenges it would face. How would the US go about banning TikTok? Should we be worried about TikTok? TikTok fans 'exploited' for digital gifts Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that ByteDance had agreed to completely divest TikTok's US operations. Previously the Chinese company had sought to keep a minority stake, with Microsoft reportedly in talks to buy the app. But sources quoted by Reuters said ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft Corp would take over TikTok in the US. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. TikTok's US general manager said the company had heard an ""outpouring of support"" for the app, and thanked the ""millions of Americans"" who used it every day.

Analysis by James Clayton, BBC North America technology correspondent Trump's dislike of TikTok goes further than just privacy concerns. In India TikTok was banned after a border skirmish with China - it was caught up in a geopolitical feud. And that's what's happened here, too. Trump's sights are set firmly on China - and this should be seen through that lens. TikTok says that it doesn't keep any data in China and would never give it to China. But, in many ways it doesn't matter what they say, the fact that they are owned by a Chinese's company is guilt enough. Not to be overlooked either is Trump's previous experience with TikTok. Last month users claimed to have scuppered his Tulsa rally after signing up to tickets they had no intention of using. And although there are Republican and conservative voices on TikTok, the profile of users in the US is generally young and liberal/left. It's hard to believe that's not a factor here.

"The protest is over proposed job cuts at the Nantgarw site About 300 people joined a ""walk for jobs"" to protest against redundancy plans at an aircraft engine maintenance plant on Saturday. General Electric (GE) announced in July that itplans to cut 369 jobsat its site in Nantgarw, near Caerphilly. A further 180 posts have already been lost since the coronavirus crisis began through voluntary redundancies. The Welsh Government said it was ""doing all that we can to support workers"". Protest organiser Caerphilly Trades Council urged those taking part to social distance and wear masks, as they gathered near Caerphilly Castle for the midday event. Welsh aviation sector needs 'major intervention' The protestors gathered near Caerphilly Castle GE has been consulting with 1,400 staff at Nantgarw, as the firm suffers from the drop of numbers in air travel. The company, which makes jet engines for Boeing and Airbus, has blamed the ""unprecedented impact of Covid-19"". It has said it remained focused on ""preserving our capability to respond as the industry recovers"". One aviation worker taking part called on the Welsh Government and UK government to ""get together and have a clear dialogue"" on how they can help the sector. ""We're an industry we know is going to come back, we know people are going to be flying,"" he said. ""We're high tech, high skilled employees and we're asking the government now to maintain these high skills, maintain these jobs so when it comes back we can have a secure future."" About 300 people joined the protest over job cuts Shadow Welsh secretary Nia Griffith said: ""It's absolutely vital that we save these jobs. ""Aerospace is a really dynamic industry, it's going places, there are such exciting developments and if the government does not put in the support now we will lose out."" Wayne David, Labour MP for Caerphilly, added: ""The aviation sector is vitally important to Wales. ""It'll be a huge body blow to the economy. Those are well-paid jobs, there'll be a knock-on effect and obviously it's devastating for them and their families."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The aviation industry faces an extremely challenging environment in dealing with the effects of coronavirus. ""We are doing all that we can to support workers, and once again call on the UK government to take a full and active role to safeguard jobs in the sector, and see the industry through this incredibly difficult period."" The UK government said: ""We understand this is difficult time for the workers of General Electric and their families and stand ready to support those at risk of losing their jobs.

"Businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic must now start contributing to the government's job retention scheme. From Saturday, firms must pay national insurance and pension contributions until the scheme ends in October. But the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government not to ""pull up the business support drawbridge"" and said more help was needed to save jobs. The government said millions of jobs have been saved because of the scheme. It comes as some businesses face putting workers back on furlough afterplans to ease lockdown in England were halted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. How is furlough changing? Redundancy pay to be protected by new law Closing furlough 'could lead to 10% unemployment' Latestfigures,externalfrom the government show 9.5 million jobs - a third of the private sector work force - have been furloughed during the pandemic, at a cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury. However, theResolution Foundation,externalsaid fewer than 4.5 million workers were currently on the scheme, down from a high of nearly eight million in April. The think tank warned that winding the scheme down ""carries the real risk of increased redundancies"", echoing concerns raised earlier this week thatit could push unemployment to 10% this year. And the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government more help, not less, help was needed to save jobs. ""Even with critical emergency measures in place, jobs are sadly being lost in the here and now,"" said FSB chairman Mike Cherry. ""Further targeted support for those [businesses] having to remain shut is urgently needed, especially in areas where local lockdowns are in place."" The job retention scheme was introduced by the Treasury at the beginning of the pandemic to prevent mass redundancies and was originally intended to last until the end of July. Under the scheme, workers get 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month. The Resolution Foundation said the changes from Saturday will cost employers an average of Â£70 a month - or 5% of the employees' pre-furloughed pay. Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the think tank, said the scheme had protected family incomes and prevented ""catastrophic levels of unemployment"". But he said millions of employees are currently without work - particularly in sectors such as hospitality and leisure - and called for the government to phase out support for these ""hardest-hit"" sectors more slowly due to a heightened risk of unemployment. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said businesses ""now face the stark choice of letting go of their staff or facing a hefty financial burden to keep them on"". He called on the government to abandon the blanket withdrawal of the furlough scheme for all businesses in October. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health It comes as businesses in England expecting to reopen this weekend were told they will now have to wait at least another fortnight because of a rise in coronavirus cases. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and close-contact beauty treatments are among those to be affected by the latest changes. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We said at the start of the crisis that we couldn't save every job - but it's clear that the furlough scheme has saved millions of them - and now many people who've been furloughed are able to return to work. ""That's good for the economy, but more importantly it's good for individuals, their families and communities.""

"It was ""showbusiness as usual"" at this year's Bafta TV Awards, despite the dramatically pared-down ceremony. There was no red carpet or live audience on Friday evening, and winners dialled in remotely to accept their prizes. ""Tonight, we reward various people while keeping the kind of distance from them that I've dreamed of my entire life,"" joked host Richard Ayoade. ""It is sad it has taken a pandemic to enforce the most basic parameters of personal space."" Chernobyl and Stath Lets Flats were among the big winners of the night, andGlenda Jackson won her first TV Baftaat the age of 84. Here are some ceremony highlights alongside a few things we learned in the winners' Zoom room. Sian Clifford won female comedy performance for her role in Fleabag However, she and her co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridgedidhave to break in to their friend's house to get a good enough signal to dial in. The pair, each nominated for their performances in Fleabag, were spending the evening together at Phoebe's place - before everything went wrong. ""Our connection right up to the wire wasn't working,"" Clifford explained afterwards. ""We were trying to do it in Phoebe's garden, and we were getting feedback, and the poor Bafta producers were saying 'you need to sort it out'. ""So we broke into our friend's house, who lives down the road, he's away on holiday."" Fortunately, they asked his permission first - and they didn't need to smash any windows. ""He was more than happy to oblige,"" Clifford clarified. ""And Phoebe had a spare set of keys."" We take our hats off to this truly outstanding tan. Which, to be fair, he may not have had to travel far to achieve - as the UK had its hottest day of the year on Friday. Usually at the Baftas, the stars receive their trophy there and then - but this year they'll have to wait for them to be delivered in the post. Romesh Ranganathan came up with his own solution to this problem as his Misadventures documentary series won the features prize. His DIY Bafta trophy appeared to be made of some tinfoil, sticky tape and a Christmas bauble, which he accepted on his own awards podium - made from a dustbin. Watching on TV, you may have (quite rightly) been taking the opportunity to nose around some celebrities' houses. On first glace, The End of the F****** World star Naomi Ackie appeared to have the most boring background of the night - a plain white wall. But, the best supporting actress winner explained afterwards, that's because she's currently in the process of moving house. ""Do you wanna see?"" she asked, tilting her camera. ""This is my room right now because I'm packing - everything is a mess. ""My bed is in the wrong place, I've got loads of furniture that's unbuilt just behind me... and I had to buy a sofa, they're really expensive - did you know that?! ""So I would have made it more interesting if I could."" Not everybody had to dial in to the ceremony via Zoom - some special guests joined Ayoade in the Bafta studio. Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal were there to present the entertainment performance prize to Mo Gilligan. But prior to the ceremony, the pair ensured they were fully compliant with social distancing guidelines, by bringing a measuring tape with them. It's probably the furthest apart they've ever been from each other's bodies, as anyone who has watched the series will tell you. Mescal was still riding high from his Emmy nomination earlier this week, but Normal People won't be eligible for a TV Bafta until next year. While Strictly's win for entertainment programme was a chance to celebrate the 2019 series, questions remain over how this year's will work, amid the pandemic. ""People have to think outside the box to put on such a magnificent show,"" head judge Shirley Ballas told BBC News backstage. ""And everyone is pulling towards making the most spectacular show ever. ""We may only have 10 shows instead of 13, but I'm just delighted we got any at all in the current crisis."" She explained: ""[The professional dancers] are self-isolating in the hotel for all the group numbers, that's about as far as I can tell you, but they're taking massive precautionary measures. ""We'll be spaced a little bit more on the [judging] desk, and I guess there'll be one-way traffic going in, and they'll think of everything to make it work. You can't have an autumn and a winter without Strictly!"" Amen. Rumours have also been swirling that Bruno might have to miss this year's Strictly because quarantine rules could prevent him flying between the UK and the US - where he also appears on Dancing With The Stars. But, Shirley said: ""If the flight [restrictions] and everything lift, I know that Bruno will do everything in his power to do both shows - that's Bruno."" Will Sharpe won best supporting actor for his performance in Giri/Haji - a series notable for its bilingual nature. Characters speak both English and Japanese in the show, with subtitles applied to certain scenes. Sharpe says the use of subtitles is less alienating to viewers than it used to be. ""The success of Parasite has been very helpful in terms of that,"" he said - referring to the Korean winner of best picture at this year's Oscars. ""The feeling I get is the world is becoming increasingly international, and entertainment is shared around the world more readily and more rapidly."" He points out: ""It means you have to watch it properly as well, you can't be scanning through your phone at the same time. You have to be engaged with it, and maybe that's why it can be a challenge - but it's worth it."" As they presented comedy entertainment programme, Kermit the Frog encouraged Miss Piggy to say hello to the ceremony's host, Richard Ayoade. ""Who's Richard? Never heard of him,"" replied The Muppets' biggest diva. ""He's hosting the Baftas? The IT Crowd? The Crystal Maze?"" said Kermit, trying to jog her memory, to no avail. Kermit then reminded her Ayoade also hosts Channel 4 series Travel Man, ""where he takes different celebrities to cities around the world"". ""Oh!ThatRichard Ayoade!"" replied Miss Piggy. ""I adore him. Love you Richard, kissy kissy. By the way, I'd like to go to Venice."" ""You've ruined my losing streak!"" joked Jared Harris as he was announced as the winner of best actor for Chernobyl. It was one of two awards the HBO and Sky series won on Friday night - in addition to the seven it took home from the Bafta Craft Awards last month. But in his acceptance speech, Harris actor mentioned that a producer told him their first choice for the role was triple-Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis ""I was actually really flattered,"" Harris clarified backstage. ""I was second to Daniel Day-Lewis, I mean that's an incredible slot to be in. I'll take his cast-offs all day long!"" It's unlikely casting directors will ever be able to secure Day-Lewis again, as heannounced his retirement from actingin 2017, but Harris is hopeful he'll return. ""He's a wonderful talent. The way he approaches his work, you can see he needs to take a break every now and then because it's so all consuming, so I'm hoping he'll be back."" ""It's been a while since I played to a placethisempty,"" joked Adrian Lester as he took to the stage to present best leading actress. Tim Minchin, meanwhile, made light of the red carpet's absence, asking the nominees during his song: ""Tell me, who is the designer of your tracksuit?"" But some argued this year's ceremony was actively an improvement. ""These Baftas were miles more enjoyable than the normal Baftas,""wrote The Daily Telegraph's Anita Singh.,external""Brilliant host, short speeches, done in 90 minutes, what's not to love?""

"The Patel family had spent two years planning a pilgrimage to Mecca When Muslims are describing Eid celebrations to people from other faiths, many will say it's the equivalent of Christmas - a noisy, joyous festival of prayer, present-giving and fun with friends and family. But in Leicester - one of Britain's most vibrant multi-cultural cities - this year's Eid al-Adha is looking rather more muted. With the city still in lockdown andrestrictions not due to be lifted until Monday, religious leaders and councils have reminded people not to gather in mosques and everyone has been encouraged to stay at home. Celebrations began on Thursday evening and will run until Monday evening. For Jawaahir Daahir, explaining to her three-year-old grandson Kamil that Eid would not be going ahead as planned has been ""heartbreaking"". ""He was on the phone telling me 'I want to come to your house grandma, I want to come to your house' and I was telling him 'you can't come right now' because I live in Leicester,"" she said. ""It's so sad - what can you say? It is so hard for the children to understand."" Jawaahir Daahir said Eid is usually a time for families to plan days out and get-togethers Usually, Ms Daahir's house would be full of family members at this time - her six children, in-laws and her grandson. After going to the mosque for prayer, there would be hugs with friends, sweets for the children and an array of specially-prepared dishes and presents at home. The family would also arrange days out together - whether for meals at restaurants or walks at local beauty spots. This year, although Ms Daahir has still been preparing some of the traditional food, those enjoying it will be limited to those living in her home - her mother and one of her daughters. ""We won't be leaving the house, basically,"" she said. ""We will still be praying at home and talking to our family but it won't be the same."" Ms Daahir said she believed the lockdown would have a knock-on effect on celebrations throughout the city. ""This is the time when people buy presents and clothes, so it will affect businesses as well,"" she said. Leicester was placed into an extended lockdown on 29 June and a recent review saidplaces of worship would be able to fully reopen from Monday- when Eid ends. Similarly tosome parts of northern England, residents have been told not to meet with different households in their homes and gardens and park gatherings should be limited to six people. It has been the second time Muslims in Leicester have marked a festival in lockdown after Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr fell in April and May. The Patel family from Leicester had planned to perform the Hajj in Mecca this weekend but have had to postpone it to next year. The annual pilgrimage to the holy site in Saudi Arabia would usually attract up to two million worshippers but this year all tourists and over-65s have been banned. ""I'm devastated,"" said Imran Patel. ""It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go and we honestly thought this was our time but it just wasn't meant to be."" The Patel family had been planning their trip to Mecca for two years The family had been planning the pilgrimage for two years and hoped to take the trip after Mr Patel suffered a major heart attack. ""For Eid this year, everyone is distant. We can't celebrate as we normally would but hopefully it won't be for long,"" he said. ""I wanted to complete my Hajj before I turned 40 next year but you just never know what's round the corner. I feel fit and well at the moment but who knows, this time next year I might not be."" Lockdown rules mean 'spirit of Eid has gone' Hajj 2020: 'It would have been my solace Blackburn Muslims told to celebrate Eid al-Adha at home Leicester City Council advised people to limit travel, social contacts and gatherings during Eid and encouraged people to ""find new ways to worship, pray and celebrate safely together"". It said: ""We know that congregational prayer is an important part of many religious practices and unfortunately that hasn't been possible for many months now because of the increased risk of Covid-19 transmission."" Imam Dr Hafiz Ather said this year's Eid was a time for people to be positive and grateful. ""Normally a prayer would commence the day of Eid in a local mosque but unfortunately we won't be able to do that here in Leicester,"" he said. ""We will still be able to spend time in prayer at home. We will still have a lovely meal and share stories and memories with our children and we will still remain upbeat. ""It is difficult this year. It is unprecedented. But at the same time we are just happy to be alive."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours?

Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held further talks on Saturday Senior US Democrats say they ""not close yet"" to clinching a deal with the White House over the latest Covid-19 relief package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that a three-hour meeting on Saturday was ""more productive than the other meetings"".

But he added: ""There are
many issues that are still very much outstanding."" He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House
Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol. Negotiations have focused on an extension of the $600 (Â£458) per week federal
unemployment benefits.

In April, Congress passed aCovid-19 relief package totalling $484bn (Â£391bn), which was the fourth aid bill in response to the pandemic. Nick and Emily McKerrell say few firms bother to reply Job hunters in the UK are finding it increasingly hard to find work as coronavirus takes its toll on the economy. Even well-qualified candidates find they are applying for a shrinking number of roles, often many pay grades below what they are used to. BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker has been hearing first-hand from some of the country's frustrated and worried job-seekers. A World War Two Spitfire has flown over hospitals across the south of England to pay tribute to those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. The aircraft has ""THANK U NHS"" written beneath its wings, and also bears the names of thousands of heroes of the pandemic, nominated by members of the public. Organsiers have been using the Spitfire to raise money for NHS charities. It is touring hospitals around the country throughout the summer. ""The reaction from the people on the ground and the support has been amazing,"" said pilot John Romaine. Read more about NHS Spitfire.  A Wetherspoon pub in the city of Carlisle, in northern England, has temporarily closed after a member of staff tested positive for coronavirus. Twenty-four employees at the William Rufus pub are now self-isolating. A spokesman for the Wetherspoon chain said the pub would reopen ""as and when it can get the number of staff needed to do so safely."" ""Customer test and trace details have not yet been requested by the authorities but are available when needed,"" he added. Read more here. Four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England - so not including deaths in care homes or the wider community, according to the NHS. This brings the total number to 29,342. The four patients were aged between 78 and 84. All had underlying health conditions.  The WTA said the tournament would go ahead as planned An unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus shortly before the start of the Palermo Ladies Open - an event that marks the return of professional tennis for the first time since March. The player, who was showing no symptoms of coronavirus, has withdrawn from the contest. The Women's Tennis Association said the tournament would still go ahead as planned, adding that anyone who had come into contact with the player would undergo testing. In June, a number of players contracted coronavirus whiletaking part in the Adria Tour event,organised by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic apologised, saying it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. Read more about the Palermo Open coronavirus case here. Will GrantMexico and Central America correspondent for BBC News Seeing Mexico rise to the third-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world reflects just how bad most Mexicans feel the situation in their country is. Surpassing the UK in that classification, Mexico has now registered 46,688 deaths linked to Covid-19, with only the US and Brazil having had more. The situation is bleak in Mexico in a number of ways. First, testing remains low with the government unconvinced of its importance. Only the most severe cases are tested and contact tracing is also poor. Furthermore, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador appears to continue to pour scorn on the use of face masks to combat the spread of the virus. His critics accuse him of taking a cavalier attitude to the virus and say his governmentâs response has been wholly inadequate. The government claims long-standing issues in Mexican society - such as high levels of diabetes and obesity - are partly the reason for the large number of cases. As we reported earlier, thousands of people gathered in the German capital Berlin to protest against the country's coronavirus restrictions today. Demonstrators argue that measures introduced during the pandemic - such as wearing face coverings - violate people's rights and freedoms. Here are some pictures of the protest,and you can find out more about it here. Thousands gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for the protest march The protest was peaceful but few people wore face masks or observed social distancing Some carried signs, bearing messages such as: ""Nobody has the right to obey"" This sign says: ""Oh man, how long shall this be going on like this?"" The UK has released its daily coronavirus figures. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:  For more on what these numbers mean and how they compare with previous days, take a look at the charts below: The beach resort city of Da Nang in Vietnam plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, Reuters news agency reports. Local authorities made the announcement as 40 new cases linked to the city were reported across the country. This brings the total number of cases in Vietnam to 586, while three deaths have been reported since Friday. Da Nang has a population of about 1.1m people. Local medical officials have conducted more than 8,000 tests since a new outbreak was detected in the city - popular with domestic tourists - on July 25. Authorities said testing capacity will now be increased to 8,000 to 10,000 per day. There will probably be a second wave of coronavirus in October in the UK and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"", a scientist advising the government says. Prof Calum Semple, who is a member of the advisory group Sage, made the comments afteranother scientific adviser saidpubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Semple, from the University of Liverpool, says whether pubs or the hospitality sector will be ""taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision."" Read the full storyhere. Struct social distancing measures were in place at the theatre Tokyo's main theatre for performances of the Japanese kabuki dance-drama has reopened, five months after it shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Strict social distancing measures were in place at the famous Kabukiza theatre, following a record number of fresh infections in the Japanese capital. The kabuki, however, was most unlike its usual self. Spectators were spaced apart and there were fewer performers on stage. The seats at the Kabukiza Theatre were disinfected They all wore black masks and a traditional part of the act - in which spectators shout out phrases towards the stage - was dropped. A member of the audience said she felt she had finally come back to life after five months of lockdown. Yet Covid-19 has not gone away. Tokyo reported 472 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - a record rise for a third successive day. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned on Friday that the city may declare an emergency to stem the spread of coronavirus. Masks are to be worn at by staff in the theatre Switzerland has marked its national day with a pyrotechnics display at a section of mountains in the Alps, wowing spectators while complying with social-distancing rules. Switzerlandâs national day is held every year on 1 August to celebrate the date of the central European nationâs founding in 1291. The day is usually celebrated with fireworks displays, but in times of social distancing, event organisers had to be creative this year. More than 100 kg (220 lbs) of magnesium powder were ignited at the mountain chains of Veisivi and Dent de Perroc on Friday night. The show, which illuminated 12 sq km (4.6 sq miles) of the mountains, was visible from 20 km (12 miles) away. ""It is like 100 million candles being lit on the mountains and gives them a lovely warm glow,"" organiser Jacques Morard told Reuters news agency. The Swiss government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. But on Friday, social distancing was reportedly observed as thousands watched the three-minute-long display in the Evolene valley. Obrador made the comments during a news conference on Friday The president of Mexico has said he will only wear a face mask when corruption has been completely stamped out in the country. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador made the apparently sarcastic pledge on Friday, asMexico became the country with the third-highest coronavirus death toll in the world. âYou know when Iâm going to put on a mask? When there is no corruption. Then Iâll put on a mask and Iâll stop talking,â Obrador told reporters. Corruption has long cast a shadow over Mexicoâs political system.Transparency International's most recent corruption index,externallists Mexico at 130th in the world, with a score of 29 out of 100. Obrador, who has appeared sceptical of face masks, has been criticised for his response to the Mexicoâs coronavirus epidemic. Critics say Obradorâs government was slow to impose lockdown measures and has lifted them too quickly. The US has now recorded more than 4.5m cases of coronavirus Welcome to our live coverage.

"India has recorded 57,000 new corona virus cases - the highest daily total to date Maharashtra - home to the financial capital, Mumbai - is still the worst affected state In the UK, shielding ends for some two million people - while further easing of restrictions in England is halted Pubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month, a leading scientist says Mexico's coronavirus death toll is now the world's third highest, with only the US and Brazil recording greater numbers The US top infectious diseases expert has said he is 'optimistic' a US-developed vaccine will be available by end of 2020 Millions of Americans are set to lose a $600 benefit after US politicians failed to agree a deal on its extension Holly Wallis and Alice Cuddy That's it for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Contributors were: Joshua Nevett, Deirdre Finnerty, Dulcie Lee, Holly Wallis, Alice Cuddy and David Walker As we approach the end of today's coronavirus live coverage, here is a recap of the main developments from the UK and around the world. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Read more from James here. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held further talks on Saturday Senior US Democrats say they ""not close yet"" to clinching a deal with the White House over the latest Covid-19 relief package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that a three-hour meeting on Saturday was ""more productive than the other meetings"".

But he added: ""There are
many issues that are still very much outstanding."" He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House
Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol. Negotiations have focused on an extension of the $600 (Â£458) per week federal
unemployment benefits.

In April, Congress passed aCovid-19 relief package totalling $484bn (Â£391bn), which was the fourth aid bill in response to the pandemic. Nick and Emily McKerrell say few firms bother to reply Job hunters in the UK are finding it increasingly hard to find work as coronavirus takes its toll on the economy. Even well-qualified candidates find they are applying for a shrinking number of roles, often many pay grades below what they are used to. BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker has been hearing first-hand from some of the country's frustrated and worried job-seekers. A World War Two Spitfire has flown over hospitals across the south of England to pay tribute to those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. The aircraft has ""THANK U NHS"" written beneath its wings, and also bears the names of thousands of heroes of the pandemic, nominated by members of the public. Organsiers have been using the Spitfire to raise money for NHS charities. It is touring hospitals around the country throughout the summer. ""The reaction from the people on the ground and the support has been amazing,"" said pilot John Romaine. Read more about NHS Spitfire.  A Wetherspoon pub in the city of Carlisle, in northern England, has temporarily closed after a member of staff tested positive for coronavirus. Twenty-four employees at the William Rufus pub are now self-isolating. A spokesman for the Wetherspoon chain said the pub would reopen ""as and when it can get the number of staff needed to do so safely."" ""Customer test and trace details have not yet been requested by the authorities but are available when needed,"" he added. Read more here. Four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England - so not including deaths in care homes or the wider community, according to the NHS. This brings the total number to 29,342. The four patients were aged between 78 and 84. All had underlying health conditions.  The WTA said the tournament would go ahead as planned An unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus shortly before the start of the Palermo Ladies Open - an event that marks the return of professional tennis for the first time since March. The player, who was showing no symptoms of coronavirus, has withdrawn from the contest. The Women's Tennis Association said the tournament would still go ahead as planned, adding that anyone who had come into contact with the player would undergo testing. In June, a number of players contracted coronavirus whiletaking part in the Adria Tour event,organised by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic apologised, saying it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. Read more about the Palermo Open coronavirus case here. Will GrantMexico and Central America correspondent for BBC News Seeing Mexico rise to the third-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world reflects just how bad most Mexicans feel the situation in their country is. Surpassing the UK in that classification, Mexico has now registered 46,688 deaths linked to Covid-19, with only the US and Brazil having had more. The situation is bleak in Mexico in a number of ways. First, testing remains low with the government unconvinced of its importance. Only the most severe cases are tested and contact tracing is also poor. Furthermore, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador appears to continue to pour scorn on the use of face masks to combat the spread of the virus. His critics accuse him of taking a cavalier attitude to the virus and say his governmentâs response has been wholly inadequate. The government claims long-standing issues in Mexican society - such as high levels of diabetes and obesity - are partly the reason for the large number of cases. As we reported earlier, thousands of people gathered in the German capital Berlin to protest against the country's coronavirus restrictions today. Demonstrators argue that measures introduced during the pandemic - such as wearing face coverings - violate people's rights and freedoms. Here are some pictures of the protest,and you can find out more about it here. Thousands gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for the protest march The protest was peaceful but few people wore face masks or observed social distancing Some carried signs, bearing messages such as: ""Nobody has the right to obey"" This sign says: ""Oh man, how long shall this be going on like this?"" The UK has released its daily coronavirus figures. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:  For more on what these numbers mean and how they compare with previous days, take a look at the charts below: The beach resort city of Da Nang in Vietnam plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, Reuters news agency reports. Local authorities made the announcement as 40 new cases linked to the city were reported across the country. This brings the total number of cases in Vietnam to 586, while three deaths have been reported since Friday. Da Nang has a population of about 1.1m people. Local medical officials have conducted more than 8,000 tests since a new outbreak was detected in the city - popular with domestic tourists - on July 25. Authorities said testing capacity will now be increased to 8,000 to 10,000 per day. There will probably be a second wave of coronavirus in October in the UK and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"", a scientist advising the government says. Prof Calum Semple, who is a member of the advisory group Sage, made the comments afteranother scientific adviser saidpubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Semple, from the University of Liverpool, says whether pubs or the hospitality sector will be ""taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision."" Read the full storyhere. Struct social distancing measures were in place at the theatre Tokyo's main theatre for performances of the Japanese kabuki dance-drama has reopened, five months after it shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Strict social distancing measures were in place at the famous Kabukiza theatre, following a record number of fresh infections in the Japanese capital. The kabuki, however, was most unlike its usual self. Spectators were spaced apart and there were fewer performers on stage. The seats at the Kabukiza Theatre were disinfected They all wore black masks and a traditional part of the act - in which spectators shout out phrases towards the stage - was dropped. A member of the audience said she felt she had finally come back to life after five months of lockdown. Yet Covid-19 has not gone away. Tokyo reported 472 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - a record rise for a third successive day. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned on Friday that the city may declare an emergency to stem the spread of coronavirus. Masks are to be worn at by staff in the theatre Switzerland has marked its national day with a pyrotechnics display at a section of mountains in the Alps, wowing spectators while complying with social-distancing rules. Switzerlandâs national day is held every year on 1 August to celebrate the date of the central European nationâs founding in 1291. The day is usually celebrated with fireworks displays, but in times of social distancing, event organisers had to be creative this year. More than 100 kg (220 lbs) of magnesium powder were ignited at the mountain chains of Veisivi and Dent de Perroc on Friday night. The show, which illuminated 12 sq km (4.6 sq miles) of the mountains, was visible from 20 km (12 miles) away. ""It is like 100 million candles being lit on the mountains and gives them a lovely warm glow,"" organiser Jacques Morard told Reuters news agency. The Swiss government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. But on Friday, social distancing was reportedly observed as thousands watched the three-minute-long display in the Evolene valley. Obrador made the comments during a news conference on Friday The president of Mexico has said he will only wear a face mask when corruption has been completely stamped out in the country. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador made the apparently sarcastic pledge on Friday, asMexico became the country with the third-highest coronavirus death toll in the world. âYou know when Iâm going to put on a mask? When there is no corruption. Then Iâll put on a mask and Iâll stop talking,â Obrador told reporters. Corruption has long cast a shadow over Mexicoâs political system.Transparency International's most recent corruption index,externallists Mexico at 130th in the world, with a score of 29 out of 100. Obrador, who has appeared sceptical of face masks, has been criticised for his response to the Mexicoâs coronavirus epidemic. Critics say Obradorâs government was slow to impose lockdown measures and has lifted them too quickly. The US has now recorded more than 4.5m cases of coronavirus Welcome to our live coverage.

"More than two million people shielding against coronavirus in most of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can now leave their home and return to work. Vulnerable people were advised in March to stay at home, or shield, to avoid contracting Covid-19. In Wales the advice stays in place until 16 August. But Macmillan Cancer Support said people in the shielded group do not feel safe enough to leave their homes. It comes after the PM applied the brakes to easing restrictions further. Meanwhile, Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government,has said England could have to consider closing pubs in order to reopen schoolsin September. And businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic mustnow start contributingto the government's job retention scheme. Analysis: We're at the limit of easing lockdown At-a-glance: What can I do now? Do people still have to shield? Young shielders: I've never felt so isolated Those who have been shielding since March include people in high-risk categories, such as those who have had an organ transplant, are receiving immunosuppressant drugs, undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have severe respiratory conditions. Now, they can return to work if they cannot work from home and as long as their workplace is Covid-secure. It is still advised they maintain social distancing when outside. From Saturday, those who were shielding in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will no longer receive food boxes and medicine deliveries from the government. This video can not be played Kirsty Young has been shielding for the past four months But shielding advice remains in place for Blackburn with Darwen in the north-west of England, Leicester and Luton, and the most vulnerable will continue to shield in Wales for another two weeks. Eve Byrne from Macmillan Cancer Support said the organisation had written to the government over concerns shielders are having to ""make the impossible choice"" between their health and their job. ""People in the shielded group are telling us that they are just not feeling safe,"" she told the BBC, adding that the government needs to ensure the necessary protections are in place for people returning to work. This video can not be played ""It's helping me deal with my cancer,"" said Michelle Teale after seeing her mother Michelle Teale, from Leicester, saw her mum on Saturday for the first time in 22 weeks. Michelle has been shielding because she has secondary breast cancer. ""I can't get into words just how excited I feel today and how tough it's been, not being able to physically see her,"" she said. She took a bottle of champagne for them both to enjoy as well as some flowers for her mum. ""It feels strange, like going on holiday for the day. I feel excited but I'm also nervous"". However, other people who have been shielding say they will continue to do so. Norah Grant, who has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and leads a support group for people under 60 with the condition, says the decision to end shielding was ""very odd just considering everything that is happening in Manchester and all around"". ""I don't think I will be changing my habits,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that she will be able to work from home in one of her two jobs. ""A lot of people in our [support] group are very nervous about going back to work,"" she said. Sara Swanson, who has an immune deficiency which means she cannot produce antibodies, said she would also continue to shield. ""I really don't think it is safe,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people not following the rules."" On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England - due to come in this weekend - would be postponed for at least a fortnight. It means that the following will not be able to take place until 15 August, at the earliest: the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close-contact services indoor performances pilots of larger gatherings in sports venuesand conference centres the expansion ofwedding receptionsto allow up to 30 people beauty treatmentsthat involve the face, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading treatments Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said he supported the government's decisions on shielding and the lockdown restrictions. But he told BBC Breakfast the ""way in which the [lockdown] announcement was communicated"" on Thursday night, ""sort of dribbling out"" without all the detail, ""has caused a degree of confusion and anxiety"". The rethink on easing England's lockdown follows new restrictions for people in areas including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshireafter a spike in virus cases. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Pubs were allowed to reopen from 4 July in England Pubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Graham Medley told the BBC there may need to be a ""trade-off"", with the re-opening of schools seen as a ""priority"" for children's wellbeing. It came after England's chief medical officer said the country was ""near the limit"" of opening up society. On Friday,the PM said further easing of the lockdown would be delayed. Measures due to come in this weekend, including the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and some close-contact services, as well as the return of indoor performances and pilots of large gatherings in sports venues and conference centres, would be postponed for at least a fortnight, Boris Johnson said. The expansion of wedding receptions to allow up to 30 people was also put on hold. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference on Friday he needed to ""squeeze the brake pedal"" on easing restrictions, following a rise in coronavirus cases. And England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, warned the nation had ""probably reached near the limit or the limits"" of what can be done to reopen society, meaning trade-offs may be needed to allow pupils to return to classrooms next month as planned. Analysis: We're at the limit of easing lockdown At-a-glance: What can I do now? Lockdown easing on hold as shielding ends Mr Johnson has previously pledged that both primary and secondary schools in England will return in September ""with full attendance"". Asked whether restrictions of other activities may be needed to allow schools to reopen as planned, Prof Medley, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that's quite possible. ""I think we're in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households. ""And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. ""It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other, and then that's a matter of prioritising. Do we think pubs are more important than schools?"" Another Sage member, Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said there would probably be a second wave of the virus in October and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"". ""Whether that's potentially the pubs and the hospitality sector taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision,"" he told the BBC. But Allyson Pollock, a professor of Public Health at Newcastle University, described the idea of trade-offs as a ""diversion"" and said she did not think this was the right tactic to control the virus. ""We need to be much more confident that the government is playing its part and has a coherent testing strategy - which it doesn't have - that the test results are interpretable and that they're putting in the necessary public health and primary care measures,"" she said. ""And then we would not need to see these trade-offs."" This video can not be played Chris Whitty on lockdown easing: ""We have probably reached near the limit of what we can do"" Prof Medley, an academic at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people. This meant it was likely there would not be the same increase in virus-related hospital admissions seen in March, he said. Kirsty Drake is supposed to be getting married on 15 August - when the decision on easing restrictions again is due to be reviewed. She had finalised plans this week for a small wedding reception, but now the restrictions mean she is unable to go ahead with the gathering. ""I'm a little bit emotional about it today,"" she says. ""Everything is all up in the air again."" ""What I don't understand is that if I wanted to now I could book six tables in a restaurant outside and sit and have a meal with those same group of people I've just got married with. We'd have to [socially distance] at the venue anyway. ""In our situation it would be safer to have a meal at the venue where we are due to get married."" Ampika Pickston said postponing the easing of restrictions was ""extremely damaging"" for her salon Beauty salons are among those affected by the prime minister's announcement on Friday. They will no longer be able to restart facial treatments, such as eyelash, eyebrow and threading services this weekend. Ampika Pickston, who owns a hair and beauty salon in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said the news was ""crushing"" and ""extremely damaging"" to her business. She said her salon had been forced to cancel more than 20 clients after the easing of restrictions was put on hold. ""A lot of people are angry because they don't understand the difference between why can you still come in to get your hair done or your nails done, get a body massage, yet you can't have a facial treatment done,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""I've had some clients actually crying on the phone because they've been waiting so long to feel human again."" This week, new restrictions were announced for people in parts of northern England, including Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and parts of West Yorkshire,after a spike in virus cases. The rules include a ban on separate households meeting each other inside their homes and private gardens or mixing in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday suggest infection rates in England are rising, with around 4,200 new infections a day - compared with 3,200 a week ago. However, the level of infection is still significantly lower than it was during the peak of the pandemic. On Saturday a further 74 deaths were reported in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus to 46,193.The latest government figures,externalalso showed 771 new cases had been confirmed.

"Businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic must now start contributing to the government's job retention scheme. From Saturday, firms must pay national insurance and pension contributions until the scheme ends in October. But the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government not to ""pull up the business support drawbridge"" and said more help was needed to save jobs. The government said millions of jobs have been saved because of the scheme. It comes as some businesses face putting workers back on furlough afterplans to ease lockdown in England were halted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. How is furlough changing? Redundancy pay to be protected by new law Closing furlough 'could lead to 10% unemployment' Latestfigures,externalfrom the government show 9.5 million jobs - a third of the private sector work force - have been furloughed during the pandemic, at a cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury. However, theResolution Foundation,externalsaid fewer than 4.5 million workers were currently on the scheme, down from a high of nearly eight million in April. The think tank warned that winding the scheme down ""carries the real risk of increased redundancies"", echoing concerns raised earlier this week thatit could push unemployment to 10% this year. And the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government more help, not less, help was needed to save jobs. ""Even with critical emergency measures in place, jobs are sadly being lost in the here and now,"" said FSB chairman Mike Cherry. ""Further targeted support for those [businesses] having to remain shut is urgently needed, especially in areas where local lockdowns are in place."" The job retention scheme was introduced by the Treasury at the beginning of the pandemic to prevent mass redundancies and was originally intended to last until the end of July. Under the scheme, workers get 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month. The Resolution Foundation said the changes from Saturday will cost employers an average of Â£70 a month - or 5% of the employees' pre-furloughed pay. Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the think tank, said the scheme had protected family incomes and prevented ""catastrophic levels of unemployment"". But he said millions of employees are currently without work - particularly in sectors such as hospitality and leisure - and called for the government to phase out support for these ""hardest-hit"" sectors more slowly due to a heightened risk of unemployment. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said businesses ""now face the stark choice of letting go of their staff or facing a hefty financial burden to keep them on"". He called on the government to abandon the blanket withdrawal of the furlough scheme for all businesses in October. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

A Treasury spokesman said: ""We said at the start of the crisis that we couldn't save every job - but it's clear that the furlough scheme has saved millions of them - and now many people who've been furloughed are able to return to work.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak today. We'll have another update for you on Sunday morning. More than two million peoplewho have been shielding against coronavirusbecause they are at high risk can now leave their homes and return to work in most of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comesas a further easing of lockdown restrictionsin England has been postponed due to rise in cases. Here'sall you need to knowabout the new measures. The jobs market has become increasingly difficult in the last few months, with many people struggling to find work. Nick and Emily McKerrell, who have university degrees, several years in employment and youth on their side, sayfew employers botherto even reply to their applications.

"Businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic must now start contributing to the government's job retention scheme. From Saturday, firms must pay national insurance and pension contributions until the scheme ends in October. But the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government not to ""pull up the business support drawbridge"" and said more help was needed to save jobs. The government said millions of jobs have been saved because of the scheme. It comes as some businesses face putting workers back on furlough afterplans to ease lockdown in England were halted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. How is furlough changing? Redundancy pay to be protected by new law Closing furlough 'could lead to 10% unemployment' Latestfigures,externalfrom the government show 9.5 million jobs - a third of the private sector work force - have been furloughed during the pandemic, at a cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury. However, theResolution Foundation,externalsaid fewer than 4.5 million workers were currently on the scheme, down from a high of nearly eight million in April. The think tank warned that winding the scheme down ""carries the real risk of increased redundancies"", echoing concerns raised earlier this week thatit could push unemployment to 10% this year. And the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government more help, not less, help was needed to save jobs. ""Even with critical emergency measures in place, jobs are sadly being lost in the here and now,"" said FSB chairman Mike Cherry. ""Further targeted support for those [businesses] having to remain shut is urgently needed, especially in areas where local lockdowns are in place."" The job retention scheme was introduced by the Treasury at the beginning of the pandemic to prevent mass redundancies and was originally intended to last until the end of July. Under the scheme, workers get 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month. The Resolution Foundation said the changes from Saturday will cost employers an average of Â£70 a month - or 5% of the employees' pre-furloughed pay. Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the think tank, said the scheme had protected family incomes and prevented ""catastrophic levels of unemployment"". But he said millions of employees are currently without work - particularly in sectors such as hospitality and leisure - and called for the government to phase out support for these ""hardest-hit"" sectors more slowly due to a heightened risk of unemployment. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said businesses ""now face the stark choice of letting go of their staff or facing a hefty financial burden to keep them on"". He called on the government to abandon the blanket withdrawal of the furlough scheme for all businesses in October. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health It comes as businesses in England expecting to reopen this weekend were told they will now have to wait at least another fortnight because of a rise in coronavirus cases. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and close-contact beauty treatments are among those to be affected by the latest changes. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We said at the start of the crisis that we couldn't save every job - but it's clear that the furlough scheme has saved millions of them - and now many people who've been furloughed are able to return to work. ""That's good for the economy, but more importantly it's good for individuals, their families and communities.""

Contributors were: Joshua Nevett, Deirdre Finnerty, Dulcie Lee, Holly Wallis, Alice Cuddy and David Walker As we approach the end of today's coronavirus live coverage, here is a recap of the main developments from the UK and around the world. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News This is it. We are now, give or take, at the absolute limit of how much we can reopen society without a resurgence of coronavirus. This realisation at the heart of government is about more thandelaying the opening of bowling alleys, it will define our lives for months to come - and probably until we have a vaccine. And I'm sorry to break it to parents, but the biggest question mark now is around the reopening of schools. Read more from James here. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held further talks on Saturday Senior US Democrats say they ""not close yet"" to clinching a deal with the White House over the latest Covid-19 relief package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that a three-hour meeting on Saturday was ""more productive than the other meetings"".

But he added: ""There are
many issues that are still very much outstanding."" He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House
Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol. Negotiations have focused on an extension of the $600 (Â£458) per week federal
unemployment benefits.

In April, Congress passed aCovid-19 relief package totalling $484bn (Â£391bn), which was the fourth aid bill in response to the pandemic. Nick and Emily McKerrell say few firms bother to reply Job hunters in the UK are finding it increasingly hard to find work as coronavirus takes its toll on the economy. Even well-qualified candidates find they are applying for a shrinking number of roles, often many pay grades below what they are used to. BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker has been hearing first-hand from some of the country's frustrated and worried job-seekers. A World War Two Spitfire has flown over hospitals across the south of England to pay tribute to those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. The aircraft has ""THANK U NHS"" written beneath its wings, and also bears the names of thousands of heroes of the pandemic, nominated by members of the public. Organsiers have been using the Spitfire to raise money for NHS charities. It is touring hospitals around the country throughout the summer. ""The reaction from the people on the ground and the support has been amazing,"" said pilot John Romaine. Read more about NHS Spitfire.  A Wetherspoon pub in the city of Carlisle, in northern England, has temporarily closed after a member of staff tested positive for coronavirus. Twenty-four employees at the William Rufus pub are now self-isolating. A spokesman for the Wetherspoon chain said the pub would reopen ""as and when it can get the number of staff needed to do so safely."" ""Customer test and trace details have not yet been requested by the authorities but are available when needed,"" he added. Read more here. Four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England - so not including deaths in care homes or the wider community, according to the NHS. This brings the total number to 29,342. The four patients were aged between 78 and 84. All had underlying health conditions.  The WTA said the tournament would go ahead as planned An unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus shortly before the start of the Palermo Ladies Open - an event that marks the return of professional tennis for the first time since March. The player, who was showing no symptoms of coronavirus, has withdrawn from the contest. The Women's Tennis Association said the tournament would still go ahead as planned, adding that anyone who had come into contact with the player would undergo testing. In June, a number of players contracted coronavirus whiletaking part in the Adria Tour event,organised by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic apologised, saying it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. Read more about the Palermo Open coronavirus case here. Will GrantMexico and Central America correspondent for BBC News Seeing Mexico rise to the third-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world reflects just how bad most Mexicans feel the situation in their country is. Surpassing the UK in that classification, Mexico has now registered 46,688 deaths linked to Covid-19, with only the US and Brazil having had more. The situation is bleak in Mexico in a number of ways. First, testing remains low with the government unconvinced of its importance. Only the most severe cases are tested and contact tracing is also poor. Furthermore, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador appears to continue to pour scorn on the use of face masks to combat the spread of the virus. His critics accuse him of taking a cavalier attitude to the virus and say his governmentâs response has been wholly inadequate. The government claims long-standing issues in Mexican society - such as high levels of diabetes and obesity - are partly the reason for the large number of cases. As we reported earlier, thousands of people gathered in the German capital Berlin to protest against the country's coronavirus restrictions today. Demonstrators argue that measures introduced during the pandemic - such as wearing face coverings - violate people's rights and freedoms. Here are some pictures of the protest,and you can find out more about it here. Thousands gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for the protest march The protest was peaceful but few people wore face masks or observed social distancing Some carried signs, bearing messages such as: ""Nobody has the right to obey"" This sign says: ""Oh man, how long shall this be going on like this?"" The UK has released its daily coronavirus figures. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:  For more on what these numbers mean and how they compare with previous days, take a look at the charts below: The beach resort city of Da Nang in Vietnam plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, Reuters news agency reports. Local authorities made the announcement as 40 new cases linked to the city were reported across the country. This brings the total number of cases in Vietnam to 586, while three deaths have been reported since Friday. Da Nang has a population of about 1.1m people. Local medical officials have conducted more than 8,000 tests since a new outbreak was detected in the city - popular with domestic tourists - on July 25. Authorities said testing capacity will now be increased to 8,000 to 10,000 per day. There will probably be a second wave of coronavirus in October in the UK and ""some hard decisions will need to be made about what restrictions need to be reintroduced"", a scientist advising the government says. Prof Calum Semple, who is a member of the advisory group Sage, made the comments afteranother scientific adviser saidpubs or ""other activities"" in England may need to close to allow schools to reopen next month. Prof Semple, from the University of Liverpool, says whether pubs or the hospitality sector will be ""taking a hit in preference to education will be a political decision."" Read the full storyhere. Struct social distancing measures were in place at the theatre Tokyo's main theatre for performances of the Japanese kabuki dance-drama has reopened, five months after it shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Strict social distancing measures were in place at the famous Kabukiza theatre, following a record number of fresh infections in the Japanese capital. The kabuki, however, was most unlike its usual self. Spectators were spaced apart and there were fewer performers on stage. The seats at the Kabukiza Theatre were disinfected They all wore black masks and a traditional part of the act - in which spectators shout out phrases towards the stage - was dropped. A member of the audience said she felt she had finally come back to life after five months of lockdown. Yet Covid-19 has not gone away. Tokyo reported 472 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - a record rise for a third successive day. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warned on Friday that the city may declare an emergency to stem the spread of coronavirus. Masks are to be worn at by staff in the theatre Switzerland has marked its national day with a pyrotechnics display at a section of mountains in the Alps, wowing spectators while complying with social-distancing rules. Switzerlandâs national day is held every year on 1 August to celebrate the date of the central European nationâs founding in 1291. The day is usually celebrated with fireworks displays, but in times of social distancing, event organisers had to be creative this year. More than 100 kg (220 lbs) of magnesium powder were ignited at the mountain chains of Veisivi and Dent de Perroc on Friday night. The show, which illuminated 12 sq km (4.6 sq miles) of the mountains, was visible from 20 km (12 miles) away. ""It is like 100 million candles being lit on the mountains and gives them a lovely warm glow,"" organiser Jacques Morard told Reuters news agency. The Swiss government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. But on Friday, social distancing was reportedly observed as thousands watched the three-minute-long display in the Evolene valley. Obrador made the comments during a news conference on Friday The president of Mexico has said he will only wear a face mask when corruption has been completely stamped out in the country. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador made the apparently sarcastic pledge on Friday, asMexico became the country with the third-highest coronavirus death toll in the world. âYou know when Iâm going to put on a mask? When there is no corruption. Then Iâll put on a mask and Iâll stop talking,â Obrador told reporters. Corruption has long cast a shadow over Mexicoâs political system.Transparency International's most recent corruption index,externallists Mexico at 130th in the world, with a score of 29 out of 100. Obrador, who has appeared sceptical of face masks, has been criticised for his response to the Mexicoâs coronavirus epidemic. Critics say Obradorâs government was slow to impose lockdown measures and has lifted them too quickly. The US has now recorded more than 4.5m cases of coronavirus Welcome to our live coverage. Here's a look at some of the latest developments in the US:  A further two people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales. The number of cases have increased by 21, according to Public Health Wales. For the 16th day in a row, Scotland recorded no new deaths among people who tested positive. Another 18 cases of the virus were recorded, the Scottish government said. We'll bring you the figures for Northern Ireland and England when we get them, as well as the UK-wide figures later.

"Sandbags remain in place after being dropped by an RAF helicopter a year ago It was a shock for 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge last summer when they were abruptly ordered to leave their homes over fears a badly damaged dam could collapse and cause a devastating flood. It would be nearly a week before they were allowed back to the Derbyshire town and there were jubilant scenes as they returned. Now 12 months have passed - and amid another major crisis with the coronavirus pandemic - how are residents feeling? On the afternoon of Thursday 1 August 2019, about 1,500 peoplewere instructed to leave their homes in Whaley Bridge immediatelyand find alternative accommodation. Heavy rain had caused a large section of the dam's spillway at Toddbrook Reservoir to fall away and there were fears the whole structure could collapse, leading to a huge flood with the potential to wipe out much of the town. This understated council tweet on the morning of the evacuation gave no hint of the drama to follow Many expected the evacuation to last a few hours or just one night - but in fact it was not until the following Wednesday they were given the green light to return. During that time, emergency crews worked relentlessly to pump huge amounts of water from the reservoir to bring levels down whilean RAF Chinook helicopterdropped sandbags and aggregate into the compromised spillway to reinforce it. Temporary repairs to the dam have almost been completed. The Canal and River Trust, which owns the dam, said it was now ""secure against any extreme weather event"". Footpaths around the reservoir are due to reopen this month and a permanent repair project has been slated to start next spring, with a scheduled 2023 completion date. Excess rainwater is still pumped from the reservoir to keep levels low In March, an independent review carried out on behalf the government found the emergencywas caused by poor design and a lack of maintenance. Any excess rainwater falling in the reservoir has continued to be removed by pumps and it will remain drained until all repair work has concluded. There were joyous scenes as residents returned - but did the good feeling continue? ""The first few days of being home were a mixture of emotions,"" said Whaley Bridge resident Kelly Baker. ""On the one hand there was total relief we had a home to come back to and pure joy at seeing friends and neighbours. ""But on the other hand there was a lot of anxiety about the river bursting its banks again. ""Even now, 12 months later, I still get a little anxious when we have heavy rain."" Kelly Baker said the evacuation was a much scarier situation than the pandemic Gill Barras, who also lives in the town, does not feel as nervous. ""It will be the safest dam in Britain,"" she said. ""The village could have gone - the whole world knew about it. So obviously they're going to make it really strong. ""I have no doubts whatsoever. It's all the other dams they need to worry about."" Gill Barras said she was given 10 minutes to leave her home on 1 August Some residents even look back on the evacuation with some fondness. Ian Kidd said: ""I think everyone contributed in one way or another - whether it was the two ladies making tea and coffee [for evacuated residents] or the people who came in and started doing hot meals. ""So although we had this impending disaster, it was a really nice time to be a member of this community."" Fred Salmon said he felt safe and confident a year later The crisis came as a shock to the system to Fred Salmon, who runs Whaley Bridge cycling shop The Bike Factory. ""It almost wiped us out completely,"" he said. ""It showed how vulnerable we were at the time. We'd got a great little business going with repairs and a workshop but the online store was only a small part of it. ""We changed everything and fully committed to developing our online store and we seem to be motoring ahead now."" The RAF Chinook spent several days dropping sandbags to shore up the damaged dam You might have thought the frightening situation would put prospective buyers off moving to the area but estate agent Lorraine Batty said it actually gave the town a boost. ""It put us on the world map. Everybody knew about Whaley Bridge,"" she said. ""After about a month when things had settled down a little bit with the dam, we did more sales in the latter part of the year than we've ever done previously. ""And property prices were increasing slightly as well - probably between five and 10%. ""I'd been extremely concerned how people would perceive the market very close to the dam but we saw the absolute opposite and yes, it surprised me. ""I just think it's a beautiful place in the world to be."" The prime minister visited the scene the day after the evacuation took place The emergency response involved police, councils, the military and about 1,000 firefighters who helped to pump millions of gallons of water from the reservoir. Gavin Tomlinson, Derbyshire's chief fire officer, said: ""You can look back now with a sense of pride having achieved what we set out to achieve but at the time it was touch-and-go whether the dam would collapse or not. ""All the time we had to have another plan. We had to have other crews that nobody actually ever saw that were stood by at two other locations below the dam in case it did burst. ""I'm very proud of everyone involved."" After returning to their properties, residents were given advice on future evacuations Resident Kelly Baker did not believe there was any comparison between the dam evacuation and the ongoing coronavirus situation. ""Last year we didn't know if we would have a home to come back to,"" she said. ""This year home is where we have kept our children safe. ""Yes, it's been disruptive in the sense that both girls had their birthday parties cancelled, my oldest daughter didn't get to finish her first year of high school and my youngest daughter hasn't been able to go and see her school or meet her teachers before she starts reception in September. ""But there's nothing we can do about it - and the plus side of the Covid crisis is the time we as a family have spent together and the memories made along the way.""

Excess rainwater is still pumped from the reservoir to keep levels low In March, an independent review carried out on behalf the government found the emergencywas caused by poor design and a lack of maintenance. Any excess rainwater falling in the reservoir has continued to be removed by pumps and it will remain drained until all repair work has concluded. There were joyous scenes as residents returned - but did the good feeling continue? ""The first few days of being home were a mixture of emotions,"" said Whaley Bridge resident Kelly Baker. ""On the one hand there was total relief we had a home to come back to and pure joy at seeing friends and neighbours. ""But on the other hand there was a lot of anxiety about the river bursting its banks again. ""Even now, 12 months later, I still get a little anxious when we have heavy rain."" Kelly Baker said the evacuation was a much scarier situation than the pandemic Gill Barras, who also lives in the town, does not feel as nervous. ""It will be the safest dam in Britain,"" she said. ""The village could have gone - the whole world knew about it. So obviously they're going to make it really strong. ""I have no doubts whatsoever. It's all the other dams they need to worry about."" Gill Barras said she was given 10 minutes to leave her home on 1 August Some residents even look back on the evacuation with some fondness. Ian Kidd said: ""I think everyone contributed in one way or another - whether it was the two ladies making tea and coffee [for evacuated residents] or the people who came in and started doing hot meals. ""So although we had this impending disaster, it was a really nice time to be a member of this community."" Fred Salmon said he felt safe and confident a year later The crisis came as a shock to the system to Fred Salmon, who runs Whaley Bridge cycling shop The Bike Factory. ""It almost wiped us out completely,"" he said. ""It showed how vulnerable we were at the time. We'd got a great little business going with repairs and a workshop but the online store was only a small part of it. ""We changed everything and fully committed to developing our online store and we seem to be motoring ahead now."" The RAF Chinook spent several days dropping sandbags to shore up the damaged dam You might have thought the frightening situation would put prospective buyers off moving to the area but estate agent Lorraine Batty said it actually gave the town a boost. ""It put us on the world map. Everybody knew about Whaley Bridge,"" she said. ""After about a month when things had settled down a little bit with the dam, we did more sales in the latter part of the year than we've ever done previously. ""And property prices were increasing slightly as well - probably between five and 10%. ""I'd been extremely concerned how people would perceive the market very close to the dam but we saw the absolute opposite and yes, it surprised me. ""I just think it's a beautiful place in the world to be."" The prime minister visited the scene the day after the evacuation took place The emergency response involved police, councils, the military and about 1,000 firefighters who helped to pump millions of gallons of water from the reservoir. Gavin Tomlinson, Derbyshire's chief fire officer, said: ""You can look back now with a sense of pride having achieved what we set out to achieve but at the time it was touch-and-go whether the dam would collapse or not. ""All the time we had to have another plan. We had to have other crews that nobody actually ever saw that were stood by at two other locations below the dam in case it did burst. ""I'm very proud of everyone involved."" After returning to their properties, residents were given advice on future evacuations Resident Kelly Baker did not believe there was any comparison between the dam evacuation and the ongoing coronavirus situation. ""Last year we didn't know if we would have a home to come back to,"" she said. ""This year home is where we have kept our children safe. ""Yes, it's been disruptive in the sense that both girls had their birthday parties cancelled, my oldest daughter didn't get to finish her first year of high school and my youngest daughter hasn't been able to go and see her school or meet her teachers before she starts reception in September.

"Businesses that have furloughed staff during the coronavirus pandemic must now start contributing to the government's job retention scheme. From Saturday, firms must pay national insurance and pension contributions until the scheme ends in October. But the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government not to ""pull up the business support drawbridge"" and said more help was needed to save jobs. The government said millions of jobs have been saved because of the scheme. It comes as some businesses face putting workers back on furlough afterplans to ease lockdown in England were halted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. How is furlough changing? Redundancy pay to be protected by new law Closing furlough 'could lead to 10% unemployment' Latestfigures,externalfrom the government show 9.5 million jobs - a third of the private sector work force - have been furloughed during the pandemic, at a cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury. However, theResolution Foundation,externalsaid fewer than 4.5 million workers were currently on the scheme, down from a high of nearly eight million in April. The think tank warned that winding the scheme down ""carries the real risk of increased redundancies"", echoing concerns raised earlier this week thatit could push unemployment to 10% this year. And the Federation of Small Businesses warned the government more help, not less, help was needed to save jobs. ""Even with critical emergency measures in place, jobs are sadly being lost in the here and now,"" said FSB chairman Mike Cherry. ""Further targeted support for those [businesses] having to remain shut is urgently needed, especially in areas where local lockdowns are in place."" The job retention scheme was introduced by the Treasury at the beginning of the pandemic to prevent mass redundancies and was originally intended to last until the end of July. Under the scheme, workers get 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to Â£2,500 a month. The Resolution Foundation said the changes from Saturday will cost employers an average of Â£70 a month - or 5% of the employees' pre-furloughed pay. Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the think tank, said the scheme had protected family incomes and prevented ""catastrophic levels of unemployment"". But he said millions of employees are currently without work - particularly in sectors such as hospitality and leisure - and called for the government to phase out support for these ""hardest-hit"" sectors more slowly due to a heightened risk of unemployment. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said businesses ""now face the stark choice of letting go of their staff or facing a hefty financial burden to keep them on"". He called on the government to abandon the blanket withdrawal of the furlough scheme for all businesses in October. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health It comes as businesses in England expecting to reopen this weekend were told they will now have to wait at least another fortnight because of a rise in coronavirus cases. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and close-contact beauty treatments are among those to be affected by the latest changes. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We said at the start of the crisis that we couldn't save every job - but it's clear that the furlough scheme has saved millions of them - and now many people who've been furloughed are able to return to work. ""That's good for the economy, but more importantly it's good for individuals, their families and communities.""

"Sandbags remain in place after being dropped by an RAF helicopter a year ago It was a shock for 1,500 people in Whaley Bridge last summer when they were abruptly ordered to leave their homes over fears a badly damaged dam could collapse and cause a devastating flood. It would be nearly a week before they were allowed back to the Derbyshire town and there were jubilant scenes as they returned. Now 12 months have passed - and amid another major crisis with the coronavirus pandemic - how are residents feeling? On the afternoon of Thursday 1 August 2019, about 1,500 peoplewere instructed to leave their homes in Whaley Bridge immediatelyand find alternative accommodation. Heavy rain had caused a large section of the dam's spillway at Toddbrook Reservoir to fall away and there were fears the whole structure could collapse, leading to a huge flood with the potential to wipe out much of the town. This understated council tweet on the morning of the evacuation gave no hint of the drama to follow Many expected the evacuation to last a few hours or just one night - but in fact it was not until the following Wednesday they were given the green light to return. During that time, emergency crews worked relentlessly to pump huge amounts of water from the reservoir to bring levels down whilean RAF Chinook helicopterdropped sandbags and aggregate into the compromised spillway to reinforce it. Temporary repairs to the dam have almost been completed. The Canal and River Trust, which owns the dam, said it was now ""secure against any extreme weather event"". Footpaths around the reservoir are due to reopen this month and a permanent repair project has been slated to start next spring, with a scheduled 2023 completion date. Excess rainwater is still pumped from the reservoir to keep levels low In March, an independent review carried out on behalf the government found the emergencywas caused by poor design and a lack of maintenance. Any excess rainwater falling in the reservoir has continued to be removed by pumps and it will remain drained until all repair work has concluded.
