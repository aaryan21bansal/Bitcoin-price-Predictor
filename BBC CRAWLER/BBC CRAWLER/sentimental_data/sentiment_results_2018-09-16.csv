"Michael Gove: Theresa May's plan is the right one ""for now"" A future prime minister could choose to alter the relationship between the UK and the EU, Michael Gove has said. But the environment secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Theresa May's strategy, agreed at Chequers in July, was the right plan ""for now"". The proposals have sparked criticism from other Brexiteers and resulted in some discussing a leadership challenge. Meanwhile, London mayor Sadiq Khanhas called for a second EU referendumon the deal Mrs May agrees with Brussels. May 'irritated' by leadership speculation Brexit: All you need to know Brexiteers discuss leadership challenge Mrs May's Brexit proposals, backed by her cabinet including Mr Gove, are unpopular with many backbench Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Asked if the Chequers plan was permanent, Mr Gove, who was a leading figure in the Leave campaign, said: ""Yes, but there's one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union. ""But the Chequers approach is the right one for now because we have got to make sure that we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the European Union."" Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative leader and a leading campaigner for Brexit, dismissed Mr Gove's comments as a ""cop-out"" and ""one of the worst ways of dealing with the negotiations"". ""We have to seize what we want now,"" he said. ""That's what people voted for. That's what Brexit is about, leaving with the right deal. ""And the prime minister, at the same time, has got to recognise that there is an alternative [to the Chequers deal], called the WTO [World Trade Organisation]."" He continued: ""There's another alternative called free trade which the European Union is demanding and asking for. ""So let's get on and deal with that and sort the border out, not mess around with Chequers."" By Chris Mason, political correspondent Michael Gove is flashing a saucy bit of Brexiteer ankle at some of his Conservative colleagues who also voted Leave, but think the prime minister's plan is a dud. Suck it up for now, spit out later, he suggests - while openly imagining the political world after Theresa May. It's a reminder that Brexiteers in the parliamentary Conservative Party are divided - between those willing to live with her Brexit plan, and those who want to ""chuck Chequers"". Who wins this tug of war could determine what Brexit looks like and how long the Prime Minister lasts. This video can not be played 'It's not about my future but that of the UK', says May In an interview to mark the six-month countdown to Brexit, Mrs May told Nick Robinson on the BBC's Panorama programme she was irritated by the ongoing speculation over her position as prime minister. Asked if she would reassure the Tory party that she was not determined to go ""on and on"", she said: ""I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future. This debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom. ""That's what I'm focused on and that's what we should all be focused on. ""It's ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that's what's important for us."" This video can not be played Theresa May hits back at Boris Johnson over Chequers plan ""Theresa May's aides know that she - they - are in the battle of their political lives not just to secure a deal with the EU's 27 other leaders but to sell it to a party that is deeply sceptical, a parliament which is deeply divided and a public which is growing heartily sick of Brexit and the Tories infighting [writes Nick Robinson]. ""That is the reason I and a team from BBC One's Panorama were invited 'Inside Number 10' to make a film which they hope will would pull back the curtain just a little on the the serious, shy, and, at times, awkward leader they serve.""

About 50 Brexit-supporting members of the European Research Group (ERG) met on Tuesday to discuss a leadership challenge. The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Chequers worse than status quo - Johnson Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' Brexit Mrs May has said she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves on 29 March 2019. She has also said there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal, including a transition period up to the end of 2020.  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong Typhoon Mangkhut is lashing China's most populous province, bringing winds of up to 100 mph (162 kph). Guangdong is on its highest alert for the storm, which also hit Hong Kong, where it swayed skyscrapers and blew out windows. The death toll from the Philippines has now risen to at least 59. Most died in landslides caused by heavy rain. Mangkhut, considered the strongest storm of 2018, ploughed through the northern Philippines on Saturday. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon local time, state media reported. In pictures: Deadly typhoon hits China More than 2.45 million people have been relocated, and authorities there issued their highest warning level, a red alert. Typhoon Mangkhut brought flooding to Hong Kong Waves crashed against the Hung Hom Promenade in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, authorities also issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (177 kph). Officials put the number of injured at more than 200 but the territory avoided the worst of the storm. Water levels surged by almost 3.5 m (12 ft) in places and live fish were washed on to the streets. Most shops and public services were shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. ""I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,"" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Mangkhut is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday as it moves inland. Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut has destroyed more than 750 buildings in this town in the Philippines. One of the worst incidents was in Itogon municipality, where accommodation for miners was crushed by a large landslide, killing at least 26, according to police. Eight more people are missing there. Officials say that two first responders reported on Saturday to have been killed in a landslide in Cordillera province have been accounted for. The BBC's Howard Johnson travelled 80km (50 miles) from the city of Tuguegarao to Aparri on the northern coast. He describes a trail of destruction along the route - forests ripped to shreds, electricity poles felled and crops eradicated. Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Landslides claimed most of the victims in the Philippines The full impact is still emerging Preparation and evacuation procedures have improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. How have you been affected by the typhoon? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Elderly people in good health should not take an aspirin a day, according to a major study in the US and Australia. There are proven benefits of the drug for people after a heart attack or stroke. But the trial found no benefit for healthy people over the age of 70, and the pills increased the risk of potentially fatal internal bleeding. Experts described the results as very important and cautioned against self-medicating with aspirin. People are prescribed aspirin after a heart attack or stroke because the drug thins the blood and reduces the chances of a repeat attack. Some completely healthy people also choose to take aspirin to reduce their risk and there is continuing research into whether the drug can be used tocut the risk of cancer,external. However, most research on the benefits of aspirin is performed on people in middle age and there is mounting evidencethe dangers increase as we get older,external. The study was of 19,114 people in the US and Australia in good health, with no history of heart problems and over the age of 70. Half were given a daily low-dose aspirin for five years. Three reports in theNew England Journal of Medicine,externalshowed the pills did not reduce their risk of heart problems or have any other benefits. They did increase the number of major stomach bleeds. Prof John McNeil, from Monash University, said: ""It means millions of healthy older people around the world who are taking low dose aspirin without a medical reason, may be doing so unnecessarily, because the study showed no overall benefit to offset the risk of bleeding. ""These findings will help inform prescribing doctors who have long been uncertain about whether to recommend aspirin to healthy patients."" Aspirin helps block tumour formation Aspirin 'major bleed' warning The study also discovered an increase in deaths from cancer, although the researchers think this needs further investigation as it goes against current findings in the field. Prof Peter Rothwell, of Oxford University, a leading expert on the drug, said the findings were definitive. ""Taking aspirin if you are otherwise healthy, over the age of 70, if you haven't had a previous heart attack or stroke, is really of very little benefit,"" he said. ""And so self-medicating with aspirin in the absence of a definite medical indication isn't advisable."" The findings do not apply to people taking aspirin because of a heart attack or stroke -  they should continue to follow their doctor's advice. And anybody who has been taking low-dose aspirin for a long time is advised not to stop overnight as that may also cause problems. Instead they should discuss any concerns with their GP, says Prof Rothwell.

"Brett Kavanaugh denies the allegations A woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted by US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has identified herself. Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post Mr Kavanaugh had pinned her to a bed and tried to undress her when they were both teenagers. Mr Kavanaugh denied the allegations when they first surfaced last week. The top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are now expected to speak to both Mr Kavanaugh and Mrs Ford. Mrs Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University,told the Post she had decided to go public,externalas her privacy was ""being chipped away"". She said she first approached Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July, shortly after Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory. If chosen for the lifetime appointment, Mr Kavanaugh would be expected to tilt the Supreme Court's balance to the right. The conservative appeals court judgeis strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views, such as on abortion. Mrs Ford said she believed the incident happened in 1982, when she was 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was 17. He was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland, and she was studying at a nearby high school. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations The incident allegedly happened at a gathering of teenagers at a house, when Mr Kavanaugh and a friend allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom. Mr Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk, she says. In the words of the Washington Post, ""While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. ""When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."" Mrs Ford, 51, is further quoted as saying that she managed to break free. ""I thought he [Mr Kavanaugh] might inadvertently kill me,"" she told the Post. Mr Kavanaugh issued his denial last week: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time"". Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room,told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"",external. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete. The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said to push through a vote then would be an ""insult"" to American women. Five takeaways from the Kavanaugh hearings Trump Supreme Court pick under microscope Listen: Who is Judge Brett Kavanaugh? Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the committee, has also said he is ""not comfortable voting yes"" should no attempt be made to hear Mrs Ford's story. Republicans have a single-vote majority on the committee, 11 to 10. ""We need to hear from her,"" he told website Politico,external. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this."" Two other Republican senators have also expressed concerns: Bob Corker, who said the vote should be delayed until the Mrs Ford is heard, andLisa Murkowski, who told CNN a delay was something ""they might have to consider"",external. Neither sit on the committee, but Republicans can ill afford any defections in the full Senate if they want Mr Kavanaugh confirmed, as they hold a slim 51-49 majority. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee's Republican chairman, said he was ""actively working"" to set up bipartisan calls to both people as a result of the revelations. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's glide path to the Supreme Court has been interrupted. That doesn't mean, however, his nomination is destined to crash and burn. The allegations about an incident that happened when the judge was a teenager, more than 30 years ago, will be difficult to prove with any degree of certainty. While Christine Blasey Ford offers corroborating evidence for her claims, the accusations won't be adjudicated in a court of law or even the court of public opinion. The only thing that matters when it comes to Mr Kavanaugh's professional fate is whether there are at least two Republicans in the Senate willing to side with Democrats and block the judge's confirmation. All eyes will be on Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two considered most likely to break ranks. This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher. Mrs Ford says she sent a letter to her local congresswoman, Democrat Anna Eshoo, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat. Mrs Ford says she believes Ms Feinstein honoured her request to keep the letter confidential, but ""others did not"". This video can not be played Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh: ""I'm a team player"" Ms Feinstein said in a statement after seeing the Washington Post article: ""I support Mrs Ford's decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee."" Senator Grassley issued a statement defending Mr Kavanaugh. ""Judge Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI full-field investigations from 1993 to 2018,"" he said. ""No such allegation resembling the anonymous claims ever surfaced.""

"Police have sealed off a restaurant in Salisbury and the surrounding area as a ""precautionary measure"" after two people were taken ill. The ambulance service called officers to Prezzo in High Street at 18:45 BST following ""a medical incident"" involving a man and a woman. Wiltshire Police said it was trying to establish what led them to fall ill. The ambulance service said the patients were conscious and being treated at the scene. South Western Ambulance Service said it was first called at 17:38 BST. A witness who was in Prezzo during the incident told the BBC that one of those taken ill was a woman in her late twenties - she appeared to be at a table on her own and ""kept going away, getting up and coming back again"". The witness added that when that woman came back in, ""she was hysterical. She called paramedics and the next thing an ambulance turns up and they come rushing in and then they rush out again."" BBC south of England correspondent Duncan Kennedy said that Public Health England is aware of the incident but ""there's no suggestion that this is connected to the Novichok incident back in March"". BBC reporter Emma Volney, who is outside the police cordon, said there were five ambulances, a dozen police officers, and members of the fire service in attendance. Allow Twitter content?

"Amazon is investigating claims that its employees accepted bribes in exchange for leaking confidential sales data. Independent sellers were also allowed to delete negative reviews and restore banned accounts for payments of between $80 (Â£61; â¬69) and $2,000, according to allegations in the Wall Street Journal. The Journal said the practice was particularly ""pronounced in China"". Amazon said it had ""zero tolerance"" for abuse of its systems and that it was conducting a ""thorough investigation"". ""We hold our employees to a high ethical standard and anyone in violation of our Code faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. They added that the company would also take ""swift action"" against sellers on its site who had ""engaged in this behaviour... including terminating their selling accounts, deleting reviews, withholding funds, and taking legal action"".

"This video can not be played Gusts & floods: the impact of the storm The ""risk to life is rising"" from Storm Florence, North Carolina's governor, Roy Cooper, has warned. In a briefing for the media, he said people should stay off the roads as the threat from floods continued to spread. Despite weakening since hitting the coast on Friday, Storm Florence has been dumping ""epic"" rain as it moves through North and South Carolina. At least 15 people have died in storm-related incidents, 10 in North Carolina and five in South Carolina. The slow-moving storm is heading west but is due to turn north towards Ohio. Florence, which started out as a hurricane, has now weakened to a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Sunday, butflash flooding and river floods will continue over a significant portion of the Carolinas,external. Winds had sustained speeds of 35mph (55km/h) with faster gusts, the NHC said. In his latest update on the situation in North Carolina, Mr Cooper said the storm had ""never been more dangerous than it is now"". Rivers were still rising and would not crest until later on Sunday or Monday. Nearly two feet (60cm) of rain had fallen in many places. The governor also warned of landslides once the weather system reached more mountainous areas. More than 900 people have been rescued from flooded areas in the state. Here's how to survive a monster storm In pictures: Hurricane Florence hits Authorities in the North Carolina city of Fayetteville ordered residents living near two rivers to evacuate. ""If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,"" Mayor Mitch Colvin said. US President Donald Trump has declared a disaster in eight counties in North Carolina - a move that will help free up federal funding for recovery efforts. The state is asking for more counties to be added to the list. Among the dead are a mother and her seven-month baby, who were were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina on Friday. A 71-year-old man died when he was blown down by high winds while checking on his dogs, while in South Carolina two died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home and two men died in separate road accidents. Florence first landed in North Carolina as a category one hurricane. The storm has lost strength as it moves inland but it has knocked out power for 800,000 businesses and homes in the Carolinas. Many are still without power. Fifteen thousand people are being housed in temporary shelters in North Carolina. Ten mass-feeding kitchens are being set up. Residents are being warned against returning home amid the dangers of floods It could be weeks before river levels return to normal The coast guard and volunteer boats have been helping people left stricken by rising flood waters. Scores of residents had to be rescued from flooding by emergency responders and volunteers in New Bern, North Carolina, on Saturday. A local, Charles Rucker, told AFP news agency: ""It was like a bullet train coming through the living room. Nothing I ever experienced before, I was truly scared."" Police in Wilmington, North Carolina, said they arrested five people for allegedly looting a discount store. Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' The numbers behind impact of Florence Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/hSome minor flooding, little structural damage.Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/hRoofs and trees could be damaged.Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/hHouses suffer damage, severe floodingStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/hSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...

"President Macron's efforts to change France's labour laws have met resistance French President Emmanuel Macron has told a young unemployed gardener that there are lots of employers seeking staff. ""I can find you a job just by crossing the road,"" said Mr Macron, after the man brought up his concerns during a street encounter in Paris. The jobseeker replied that employers did not respond to his applications. France has an unemployment rate of about 10%, which is above the European average. Mr Macron has responded by trying to make it easier for businesses to hire and fire staff and he has cut back the state sector, but he has faced protests. Last monthhe faced criticism after accusing French ""Gauls"" of being resistant to change. Can President Macron transform France? Macron: The meteoric rise of France's youngest president On Sunday, the French president was taking part in a cultural event when his exchange with the gardener was caught on camera. ""If you are ready and motivated, in hotels, cafes and construction, everywhere I go people say to me that they are looking for staff,"" Mr Macron added. Allow Twitter content?

"Sports Direct has denied claims that it wants struggling retailer Debenhams to collapse so it can buy it cheaply. Reports had suggested Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley could block Debenhams attempt to raise cash by selling its department store chain Magasin du Nord. A spokesperson said the suggestion was ""irresponsible and incorrect"". The sportswear giant recently bought House of Fraser and owns 29.7% of Debenhams, prompting speculation of a possible merger between the two chains. Sports Direct's spokesperson said that Sports Direct had discussed ""various opportunities for business collaborations to support Debenhams over the last year or so"", but said Debenhams had ""chosen not to move forward with these proposals, as is their right"". Mike Ashley: I've been stabbed in the back Debenhams-House of Fraser tie-up eyed Debenhams seeks to reassure investors Last week, an outgoing director from Sports Direct suggestedthe idea of a merger had been discussedat board level before later saying his remarks had been misinterpreted. Sports Direct later issued a formal statement confirming it did not plan to make a bid for Debenhams for six months. Under Takeover Panel rules, the chain is still able to make a bid if there is a ""material change of circumstances"" at Debenhams, with full agreement of the company's board or after a bid from a third party. Debenhams has issued three profit warnings this year Debenhams is currently in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales, and confirmed last week that it had appointed consultancy KPMG to help improve its performance. The department store chainhas issued three profit warnings this year,and has lost two-thirds of its share price value since January. As part of its cost cutting, Debenhams said in August that 80 to 90 jobs at its headquarters would be shed. That followed a February announcement it was planning to cut 320 store management jobs. The business is also looking at raising cash by selling off its Scandinavian department store chain Magasin du Nord for as much as Â£200m.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove said ""individual criticisms"" were not helpful Theresa May should condemn Hungary's ""reactionary"" government, Labour has said, following the refusal of Tory MEPs to back a censure motion. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett urged the PM to speak out against Viktor Orban's administration. Two thirds of the European Parliament backed action against Hungary's government, which is accused of attacks on minorities and the rule of law. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the MEPs were not endorsing Mr Orban. But on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he refused to condemn the right wing prime minister directly, saying a ""long-standing principle of a number of MEPs from different countries"" was not to interfere in the ""internal democracy"" of other states. Mr Orban presents himself as the defender of Hungary and Europe against Muslim migrants. Criticised for his authoritarian style, he has told Hungarian TV: ""We will never allow Hungary to become a target country for immigrants."" What sanctions can the EU impose on Hungary? Mr Trickett said it was ""shocking"" that Conservatives had whipped their 19 MEPs to vote against the motion to censure Hungary, with only one defying the order. He said the environment secretary had declined the opportunity to distance himself from Mr Orban's ""authoritarian and anti-democratic practices"", adding: ""Theresa May should do what Gove failed to do and condemn the Hungarian government."" Viktor Orban won a third term of office this year Viktor Orban was re-elected earlier this year after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, with his Fidesz party winning two thirds of parliamentary seats. Since coming to power, his government has taken a hard-line stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"". But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system and widespread corruption. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded TheEuropean Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungaryover alleged breaches of the EU's core values, which it denies. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is not being proposed. But the EU Council - the heads of government of the member states - will now begin a process which could lead to potential recommendations being made against Hungary. After Wednesday's vote, theBoard of Deputies of British Jews said it was disappointed,externalConservative MEPs had voted in ""defence"" of Hungary, while theMuslim Council of Britain questioned,externalwhether the Tories were seeking backing for its position on Brexit in return. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell was among the Labour MPs to criticise the vote at the time, urging Theresa May to ""call out"" her MEPs. Conservative peerLord Finklestein described it as ""a really distressing thing to happen and shameful"". However, the Tory MEPshad stressed their vote should not be seen as a backing of Mr Orban.,external Mr Gove told Andrew Marr: ""It is not for me to rank a league table of EU leaders. ""It's a long-standing principle of a number of MEPs from different countries and from different parties not to believe that the European Parliament should interfere in or censure the internal democracy of a particular country."" Challenged to directly condemn Mr Orban, he said: ""You or I might have particular views about other countries but the European Parliament and those within it - British MEPs and others - believe that's the wrong way of expressing criticism."" Asked by Marr if the party needed Mr Orban's support for its Brexit plan, Mr Gove said: ""No, because I think it would be wrong for me at a time when we need solidarity against a number of different threats - you mention anti-Semitism... ""I don't believe that individual criticisms of the kind you are understandably attempting me to make necessarily help us in ensuring we get both solidarity on the issues that count and the best deal for Britain as we leave the European Union.""

"Police have sealed off a restaurant in Salisbury and the surrounding area as a ""precautionary measure"" after two people were taken ill. The ambulance service called officers to Prezzo in High Street at 18:45 BST following ""a medical incident"" involving a man and a woman. Wiltshire Police said it was trying to establish what led them to fall ill. The ambulance service said the patients were conscious and being treated at the scene. South Western Ambulance Service said it was first called at 17:38 BST. A witness who was in Prezzo during the incident told the BBC that one of those taken ill was a woman in her late twenties - she appeared to be at a table on her own and ""kept going away, getting up and coming back again"". The witness added that when that woman came back in, ""she was hysterical. She called paramedics and the next thing an ambulance turns up and they come rushing in and then they rush out again."" BBC south of England correspondent Duncan Kennedy said that Public Health England is aware of the incident but ""there's no suggestion that this is connected to the Novichok incident back in March"". BBC reporter Emma Volney, who is outside the police cordon, said there were five ambulances, a dozen police officers, and members of the fire service in attendance. Allow Twitter content?

"Joe Robinson said he only spent a month with the YPG providing medical support to civilians An ex-soldier sentenced in Turkey after joining a Kurdish armed group has said he is ""begging"" for the UK government to help him. Joe Robinson was given a seven-and-a-half year jail term after volunteering with the YPG, which was fighting so-called Islamic State in Syria. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group.

Robinson, whoremains on bail pending an appealagainst his sentence, told ITV News: ""This has been going on for 14 months now. For the first four months I was locked in a high-security prison in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. ""I didn't see sunlight for three months and I wasn't allowed to see or speak to my fiancÃ©e for four months."" He added: ""I'm at the point where I am literally begging the British government to do something."" His fiancÃ©e Mira Rojkan, 23, was arrested alongside Robinson while they were on holiday last year. The Bulgarian national, who was given a suspended sentence for ""terrorism propaganda"", has called on Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to intervene in the case. The couple were arrested while on holiday in Turkey ""The UK should stop saying they can't do it, we know they can,"" she said. ""We're talking about a veteran. ""He [Mr Hunt] needs to get in touch with the Turkish authorities on a diplomatic level."" She said the family had written to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan over the case, but hoped Mr Hunt would now intervene. Robinson was released on bail in November but has been prevented from leaving Turkey Robinson, who is originally from Accrington, Lancashire, said he only spent a month with the YPG while providing medical support to civilians in July 2015.

"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: 'The British public should have a say on the outcome of negotiations' London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for a second EU referendum, criticising the government's handling of Brexit negotiations with the EU. Writing in the Observer,,externalthe Labour politician said that with the UK due to leave the EU in six months, it now faced either a ""bad deal"" or ""no deal"". The debate had also become ""more about Boris Johnson's political ambitions"" than what was good for the UK, he said. Tory minister Michael Gove said Mr Khan wanted to frustrate the will of voters. The mayor's comments are also at odds with the Labour's official policy, which is to respect the outcome of the referendum but ""leave all options on the table"" if a deal is not agreed by Parliament. Sadiq Khan warns of Brexit 'lost decade' May 'irritated' by leadership speculation Brexit: All you need to know Former Tooting MP Mr Khan said that although he campaigned to remain in the EU, he had accepted ""the will of the British people was to leave the EU"". He said he had never expected to back calls for a second referendum, but had become ""increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations had become mired in confusion and deadlock"". With time running out for the British government to negotiate a final deal with the EU before March 2019, Mr Khan said the UK was left with two ""incredibly risky"" possibilities. ""Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public,"" he wrote in the paper. ""I don't believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people's livelihoods."" Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Khan was shown comments he made to LBC radio after the Brexit referendum, in which he warned a fresh poll would lead to ""even more cynicism"" among voters. He told Marr: ""It's really important that this is not a re-run of the referendum but the British public having a say for the first time on the outcome."" Pushed on what voters should be asked in a fresh vote, he said it should be a choice between the government's deal and remaining in the EU. Asked whether that would disenfranchise supporters of a hard Brexit, Mr Khan added: ""My point is this. Rather than having a bad deal or a no deal, let's put that to the British public with the option of staying in the EU."" Mr Khan also dismissed suggestions he was trying to distract from his track record as London mayor, following criticisms of his record on knife crime, housing and transport. Mrs May has said a second referendum would be ""a gross betrayal of our democracy"" Appearing on the same programme, Environment Secretary Mr Gove, a leading Brexiteer during the referendum, said Mr Khan's comments were ""troubling"". ""People voted clearly - 17.4m people - to leave the European Union,"" Mr Gove said. ""Sadiq is essentially saying, 'Stop, lets delay the process, let's throw it into chaos'. And I think that would be a profound mistake."" Meanwhile, Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of ""backing the government every step of the way"" over Brexit. ""Jeremy Corbyn is letting the prime minister off the hook,"" she said in a speech to her party's annual conference in Brighton. ""My message to him is very clear. Grow a backbone, stand up for the millions of people who voted for you and help us stop Brexit."" The Lib Dems want another referendum and are talking to disaffected anti-Brexit Labour and Tory MPs who, they say, are considering quitting their parties.

"Mr Cable said he would not vote for the Chequers proposal even if the government argued the only alternative was no deal If Theresa May strikes a Brexit deal with Brussels based on her Chequers plan the Liberal Democrats will oppose it, Sir Vince Cable has warned. ""We are not going to buy it,"" the Lib Dem leader told a fringe meeting at his party's conference to loud applause. He said the party's 12 MPs - with one exception - were ""solid"" in their determination to stop Brexit. Stephen Lloyd MP voted Remain but hasvowed to respect the wishes,externalof his Leave-voting Eastbourne constituents. Mr Cable said he hoped to persuade Mr Lloyd to change his mind before the ""meaningful"" vote promised to MPs on the terms of any Brexit deal. Downing Street believes it can get Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would see the UK obeying single market rules for goods after Brexit - through Parliament, despite opposition from many Conservative MPs. Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable Future PM 'could change EU relationship' London mayor calls for second Brexit vote Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Mr Cable, who was business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government, said the Chequers deal had an ""enormous hole in it"" because it did not include services - which make up 80% of the British economy. The Chequers plan was a ""second best solution"" to the issue of frictionless trade in goods but was based on a ""very, very complicated mechanism,"" he added. And Mr Cable said he could not vote for it even if the government claimed the only alternative was a no deal Brexit because there are ""better alternatives"". Sir Vince, who is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: ""We're absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it."" In other  conference developments: Party members backed a policy that would allow migrant spouses an entitlement to benefits from their first day in the UK - without any form of means testing. The party also backed a complete ban on single-use plastics within three years. Deputy leader and former minister Jo Swinson admitted the party had ""lost too many arguments"" with their Conservative coalition partners and said ""when they fought dirty, we were too nice"". Sir Vince ruled out going into coalition with Labour or the Conservatives in the near future. Speaking at an earlier meeting, Mr Cable warned the world economy ""could well"" be heading for a serious crash within the ""next 18 months to two years"". The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash - warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy. And it was ""difficult to see"" major economies coming together to tackle any crisis as they did in 2008 with the current political climate, he added. The Lib Dem leader is also calling for the creation of a  Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" to protect the UK from future economic crises by bolstering the public finances. The fund could be built up through taxes on the rich and the sale of state assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, he argues.

"Westminster is buzzing with talk of splits, general elections, second referendums and even the formation of new political parties as Brexit strains traditional loyalties to breaking point. With votes on any deal struck by Theresa May with the EU expected to happen this autumn, here is a guide to the main factions in the Commons: Jeremy Wright and David Lidington - cabinet ministers loyal to the PM Government ministers, basically - there are just over 100 them out of a total of 316 Tory MPs - and those backbenchers who support Theresa May's Brexit policies, or at least are not willing to vote against them and threaten her leadership. Most Tory MPs fall into this category but it is not enough for Mrs May to be sure of winning key Commons votes, even with the support of the DUP's 10 MPs, who unlike Mrs May backed Leave in the EU referendum. Ten members of Mrs May's government have quit in recent months - most of them because they are against her Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade, although Defence Minister Guto Bebb quit because he is in favour of it. Mr Bebb thought she had caved in to the hard Brexiteers (see below) over customs legislation. He has now joined the People's Vote campaign (see below). Kuennsberg: May plans to 'keep calm and carry on' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Sixty Conservative MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured above), are members of the European Research Group - a pro-Brexit lobby, who are against Theresa May's plans for trading arrangements with the EU. They are well-organised and highly motivated and the PM's continued survival in Number 10 is, largely, in their hands. The rebel ranks were swollen by ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and his deputy Steve Baker, who all quit in protest at her blueprint for post-Brexit trade with the EU hammered out at her country residence Chequers, in July. Mr Baker claims as many as 80 Conservative MPs are prepared to vote against the Chequers plan. He has warned about a ""catastrophic split"" in the Conservative Party if it is not able to unite around a different vision. Mr Johnson has thrown grenades - and a ""suicide vest"" - into the debate from the pages of national newspapers, with increasingly strident attacks on the Chequers proposal, prompting an angry backlash from Theresa May loyalists. May warned of Tory split over Brexit plan Johnson: PM's Brexit plan a 'suicide vest' At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know The Dominic Grieve gang. Like most of his cohorts, who number about a dozen and include former minister Nicky Morgan (seated behind Mr Grieve in the picture above) who led an unsuccessful rebellion in the customs vote, the former attorney general is not a natural rebel. Mr Grieve and his supporters inflicted the government's first Brexit defeat, in December, securing a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final deal with Brussels, but some wonder whether his gang have the killer instinct of their pro-Brexit rivals when that final showdown happens in the autumn. Mr Grievehas said he will quit the party,externalif Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, in reaction to a row over the former foreign secretary's comments about the burka. Government survives key Brexit trade vote Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a close ally of Labour's Chuka Umunna in the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum (see below), has called in the past for the creation of a new centre-ground party. She also backed a call by fellow Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames - a longstanding pro-European and the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - for a ""government of national unity"", made up of senior figures from different parties to sort out Brexit, although that idea seems to have disappeared from the radar. But it is the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the UK's traditional centre party, who has emerged as the biggest cheerleader for a new centre party. Sir Vince Cable is openly encouraging disaffected anti-Brexit Labour and Tory MPs to form new groups and work with the Lib Dems to colonise what he believes is the vast territory that has opened up in British politics as Labour moves to the left under Jeremy Corbyn and Tory Brexiteers push their party to the right. Sir Vince, who has said he will stand down as Lib Dem leader once Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", admits his party, with just 12 MPs, has struggled to achieve the rapid growth in support it wanted despite being the only national party campaigning for a second referendum and has set out plans to transform into a ""movement for moderates"". Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Former Education Secretary Justine Greening is the most senior Conservative to have called for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. She was backed by Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry, and another prominent backbencher, Sarah Wollaston, has also joined the People's Vote campaign. along with Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb. No 10 rejects Greening's referendum call Jeremy Corbyn's supporters insist the party has never been more united behind its leader - despite a bitter and divisive row about anti-Semitism that dragged on for months over the summer. The vast majority of the shadow cabinet - about 30 MPs - and most of the 47 new Labour MPs elected last year, in addition to a handful of long-serving left wing backbenchers, are fiercely loyal to the leader and back his Brexit stance. But many, maybe even the majority, of the 257 Labour MPs, including the self-styled ""moderates"" who served in government during the Blair/Brown era, remain unhappy with the direction the party is going in. Some Corbyn critics have faced no confidence votes from their local parties, a sign they could face de-selection before the next general election. Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Jeremy Corbyn's backing for Brexit and refusal to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum, after campaigning for Remain in the referendum, are a major sore point among ""moderate"" Labour MPs, who suspect he remains a Eurosceptic at heart. The cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, including prominent figures such as Chuka Umunna (pictured above), Chris Leslie and Stephen Doughty. They outnumber members of other parties in the group, which also includes Lib Dems, Green MP Caroline Lucas, five Conservative MPs and Plaid Cymru's four MPs. These MPs tend to eschew party labels when commenting on Brexit. The Labour members are in open revolt against their party leadership's opposition to a second referendum - but they insist they are not operating as a party within a party. Chuka Umunna haswritten to members of his local party in Streatham,external, South London, to deny speculation he is involved in talks about the formation of a new party. The idea that the People's Vote is the forerunner of a such a party is ""patently absurd"", he writes. But he has also claimed Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are trying to force ""moderate"" MPs like himself out of Labour, something the party leadership says is simply not the case. Call off the dogs, Umunna tells Corbyn Turn fire outwards, Corbyn urges MPs Like the members of the People's Vote campaign, the SNP's 35 MPs, led by Ian Blackford (pictured) are against Brexit and want the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union. They have said they won't stand in the way of a second referendum but have not committed to voting for one. One reason for this is that Scotland voted for Remain in 2016 and it did not make any difference to the result. They are likely to vote against anything resembling a ""hard Brexit"". Kate Hoey (pictured), John Mann, Frank Field and Graham Stringer - along with the currently independent Kelvin Hopkins - voted with the government in key Brexit votes, helping to ensure Theresa May's survival. This is the core of a group who say they are standing up for the millions of Labour supporters who voted to Leave the EU. Mr Field has resigned the Labour whip in Parliament - and is fighting to remain a member of the party - after claiming it has become a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". The MP's opponents say he jumped before he was pushed after losing a confidence vote organised by local activists in Birkenhead angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes, which they believe robbed Labour of the chance to force a general election it could have won. Ms Hoey isalso facing callsto be expelled from Labour and has lost a confidence vote in her local Vauxhall Labour Party. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his Blackley and Broughton Labour branch.

"This video can not be played Gusts & floods: the impact of the storm The ""risk to life is rising"" from Storm Florence, North Carolina's governor, Roy Cooper, has warned. In a briefing for the media, he said people should stay off the roads as the threat from floods continued to spread. Despite weakening since hitting the coast on Friday, Storm Florence has been dumping ""epic"" rain as it moves through North and South Carolina. At least 15 people have died in storm-related incidents, 10 in North Carolina and five in South Carolina. The slow-moving storm is heading west but is due to turn north towards Ohio. Florence, which started out as a hurricane, has now weakened to a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Sunday, butflash flooding and river floods will continue over a significant portion of the Carolinas,external. Winds had sustained speeds of 35mph (55km/h) with faster gusts, the NHC said. In his latest update on the situation in North Carolina, Mr Cooper said the storm had ""never been more dangerous than it is now"". Rivers were still rising and would not crest until later on Sunday or Monday. Nearly two feet (60cm) of rain had fallen in many places. The governor also warned of landslides once the weather system reached more mountainous areas. More than 900 people have been rescued from flooded areas in the state. Here's how to survive a monster storm In pictures: Hurricane Florence hits Authorities in the North Carolina city of Fayetteville ordered residents living near two rivers to evacuate. ""If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,"" Mayor Mitch Colvin said. US President Donald Trump has declared a disaster in eight counties in North Carolina - a move that will help free up federal funding for recovery efforts. The state is asking for more counties to be added to the list. Among the dead are a mother and her seven-month baby, who were were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina on Friday. A 71-year-old man died when he was blown down by high winds while checking on his dogs, while in South Carolina two died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home and two men died in separate road accidents. Florence first landed in North Carolina as a category one hurricane. The storm has lost strength as it moves inland but it has knocked out power for 800,000 businesses and homes in the Carolinas. Many are still without power. Fifteen thousand people are being housed in temporary shelters in North Carolina. Ten mass-feeding kitchens are being set up. Residents are being warned against returning home amid the dangers of floods It could be weeks before river levels return to normal The coast guard and volunteer boats have been helping people left stricken by rising flood waters. Scores of residents had to be rescued from flooding by emergency responders and volunteers in New Bern, North Carolina, on Saturday. A local, Charles Rucker, told AFP news agency: ""It was like a bullet train coming through the living room. Nothing I ever experienced before, I was truly scared."" Police in Wilmington, North Carolina, said they arrested five people for allegedly looting a discount store. Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' The numbers behind impact of Florence Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

"The Mackintosh building was devastated by a fire in June just months before it was due to reopen Glasgow's Mackintosh building will definitely be rebuilt, according to Muriel Gray, chairwoman of the Glasgow School of Art's board. The building was gutted by fire in June, following another blaze in 2014. The future of the GSA has faced speculation that it could be demolished or turned into a museum. But Ms Gray, a former student at the school, told BBC Scotland it would be rebuilt as a working art school, saying that was ""non-negotiable"". She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the Â£100m cost that had been reported was ""plucked out of the air"", saying the art school had ""absolutely no idea until we know the scale of damage"". The former art school student said there would be full transparency and that the cost should not impact on the taxpayer as some of the money raised in 2014 remained. She also acknowledged that it could take up to 10 years for students to be able to use the building again which she said was the ""biggest tragedy"". Ms Gray told the programme the decision to rebuild the Mackintosh building was made after the fire four years ago and that position had not changed. ""The board of governors were completely unanimous about this and it's not up for discussion,"" she said. Muriel Gray said the cost of the rebuild should not impact on the taxpayer ""The debate now is how we fit in to the whole tragedy that's happened to the entire Garnethill  community and the Sauchiehall street refurbishing and how we do that as a working art school."" We may not survive fire, says arts venue Art school fire residents return home Glasgow fire turned lives 'upside down' Responding to comments about delays in getting people in the area back into their homes and businesses, Ms Gray said: ""We have been removing the unsafe masonry, declared unsafe by building control at the council, as fast as we possibly could, in order to allow people back. ""We've been absolutely working so hard with everyone round about us to try and make things happen quickly enough to get people back into their homes, to try and help businesses. and liaising with all the people affected."" She added: ""We were months away from just having the best, biggest party ever that was going to totally regenerate that part of Sauchiehall Street and Glasgow - the council building this beautiful regeneration plan - and it's put back again. ""You can either sit in a corner in a foetal position and weep about that or you can face up to the reality and go 'right, setback again, we are just going to come back and do this brilliantly'. ""There is absolutely no way it wouldn't be a working art school. It's non-negotiable. ""This has all been really exciting because we're actually using the blueprints from the interior of Mackintosh's original plan for the building."" Francis McKee, director of the Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA), which has been inaccessible since the fire, said a toilet in the building had been leaking for three months which had brought down the ceiling of a gallery below. He told the programme: ""For the entire time, most of the building has been outside the cordon. That lack of access, when it could have been - through common sense - given, has meant we've lost the ceiling of a gallery and the artwork in the gallery. ""That didn't have to happen. A lot of those organisations can't go anywhere else because we offer space for free. It's not about the CCA, its about the 366 partners with the CCA. We don't have the money to move things anywhere else. ""It's a very complex business and it's being treated like it's a small shop."" Mr McKee said the dates he had been given for moving back in kept changing. Colin Edgar, head of communications at Glasgow City Council, said: ""The way you would traditionally do this is you would come up with a programme, you would test it, do it, then once it's done you would start going to people 'right, its safe, now you can get back in'. ""What we're trying to do is say to people 'we think you'll get in on the date and you can start to make plans but you have to know that that date's at risk'. ""Everyone needs to work quickly together to get Francis (McKee) back in as quickly as possible but then we need to look at the future of Sauchiehall Street, which we have already started to do.""

"Mr Cable said he would not vote for the Chequers proposal even if the government argued the only alternative was no deal If Theresa May strikes a Brexit deal with Brussels based on her Chequers plan the Liberal Democrats will oppose it, Sir Vince Cable has warned. ""We are not going to buy it,"" the Lib Dem leader told a fringe meeting at his party's conference to loud applause. He said the party's 12 MPs - with one exception - were ""solid"" in their determination to stop Brexit. Stephen Lloyd MP voted Remain but hasvowed to respect the wishes,externalof his Leave-voting Eastbourne constituents. Mr Cable said he hoped to persuade Mr Lloyd to change his mind before the ""meaningful"" vote promised to MPs on the terms of any Brexit deal. Downing Street believes it can get Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would see the UK obeying single market rules for goods after Brexit - through Parliament, despite opposition from many Conservative MPs. Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable Future PM 'could change EU relationship' London mayor calls for second Brexit vote Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Mr Cable, who was business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government, said the Chequers deal had an ""enormous hole in it"" because it did not include services - which make up 80% of the British economy. The Chequers plan was a ""second best solution"" to the issue of frictionless trade in goods but was based on a ""very, very complicated mechanism,"" he added. And Mr Cable said he could not vote for it even if the government claimed the only alternative was a no deal Brexit because there are ""better alternatives"". Sir Vince, who is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: ""We're absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it."" In other  conference developments: Party members backed a policy that would allow migrant spouses an entitlement to benefits from their first day in the UK - without any form of means testing. The party also backed a complete ban on single-use plastics within three years. Deputy leader and former minister Jo Swinson admitted the party had ""lost too many arguments"" with their Conservative coalition partners and said ""when they fought dirty, we were too nice"". Sir Vince ruled out going into coalition with Labour or the Conservatives in the near future. Speaking at an earlier meeting, Mr Cable warned the world economy ""could well"" be heading for a serious crash within the ""next 18 months to two years"". The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash - warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy. And it was ""difficult to see"" major economies coming together to tackle any crisis as they did in 2008 with the current political climate, he added. The Lib Dem leader is also calling for the creation of a  Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" to protect the UK from future economic crises by bolstering the public finances. The fund could be built up through taxes on the rich and the sale of state assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, he argues.

"Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has said she never wants to be prime minister because she values her ""mental health too much"". In an interview with the Sunday Times Magazine,,externalshe revealed her struggles with self-harm, suicidal thoughts and depression as a teenager. The MSP, who is expecting her first child, also ruled out a peerage or becoming an MP at Westminster. She said the idea of leaving her child in Edinburgh was ""actually offensive"". Ms Davidson announced she and her partner Jen Wilson wereexpecting a baby in April, after undergoing IVF treatment. She is expected to give birth in October, and has announced her plans to take four or five months of maternity leave. This video can not be played Ruth Davidson in April 2018: 'I'm delighted to say we're starting a family' Ruling out taking the helm at Downing Street, the 39-year-old, who is releasing her memoirs in the paper, said: ""You have to want it, and I don't want to be prime minister"". In 2016, while David Cameron was PM, she described the role as ""the loneliest job in the world"". Who is Ruth Davidson? Davidson: PM critics must 'quit the noise' Speaking frankly about her teenage years, Ms Davidson said her mental heath suffered after a boy from her village took his own life when she was 17 years old. ""I went into a total tailspin"", she said. She said she started cutting herself, ""punching walls... drinking far, far, too much and becoming belligerent and angry"". She was diagnosed with clinical depression a year later, but said the medication meant she had ""dark, terrible dreams"" and ""couldn't tell what was real"". Ms Davidson is engaged to her partner, Jen Wilson Ms Davidson, pictured with Conservative MSP Maurice Golden, become Scottish Tory leader in 2011 In her second year studying English at Edinburgh University, she became so afraid of sleep she said she spent a whole term living nocturnally. She said her depression ""was like a smothering black blanket over my head, cutting out the sky"". ""It was heavy, constricting, suffocating. It took away hope and energy and life."" The MSP said she combated her mental health issues by exercising regularly, moderating her alcohol intake, going back to church, and ""most importantly to me, I threw away my pills"". But she said she was still ""frightened of going back to the psychological place [she] once inhabited"". ""When I have a period of heightened anxiety, or I can feel the weight of the black blanket start to descend, I go back to what I know works for me: structure, exercise, forward momentum, measurable outcomes. Sometime's that's hard in a job that's 100 miles an hour."" Toni Giugliano, policy manager at the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: ""Ruth's decision to speak out takes courage and will hopefully encourage others to do the same."" He said stigma was still ""very present"" in society. ""That's why it's so important for CEOs, bosses and national leaders to speak out about their own experiences and help drive change.""

"Joe Robinson said he only spent a month with the YPG providing medical support to civilians An ex-soldier sentenced in Turkey after joining a Kurdish armed group has said he is ""begging"" for the UK government to help him.

"This video can not be played 'It's not about my future but that of the UK', says May Theresa May has said she gets ""irritated"" by the ongoing speculation over her position as prime minister. In an interview to mark the six-month countdown to Brexit, Mrs May told the BBC the debate should be about the country's future rather than her own. The prime minister's comments came days after Conservative MPs opposed to her Brexit plan met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down. The PM also criticised ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson. Mrs May said his language was ""completely inappropriate"" when he described her Brexit strategy as putting the UK in a ""suicide vest"". The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. Brexiteers discuss leadership challenge Brexit: All you need to know Are Eurosceptic Tories really ready to move against May? About 50 Brexit-supporting members of the European Research Group (ERG) met on Tuesday to discuss a leadership challenge. This video can not be played Theresa May hits back at Boris Johnson over Chequers plan Asked if she would reassure the Tory party that she was not determined to go on and on, she told the BBC's Panorama programme: ""I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future. This debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom. ""That's what I'm focused on and that's what we should all be focused on. ""It's ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that's what's important for us."" The prime minister also said the ""bloody difficult woman"" - a description of her by former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke - was ""still there"". But she added: ""There's a difference between those who think you can only be bloody difficult in public, and those who think actually you bide your time, and you're bloody difficult when the time is right - and when it really matters."" Analysis by Chris Mason, political correspondent After a week in which the prime minister was politically duffed up by one set of her MPs openly plotting to oust her, and by another set meeting in public to discuss how to derail her blueprint for Brexit, this is Theresa May's response. A few things stood out for me; her willingness, again, to embrace what was meant to be an unflattering description of her - by Conservative colleague Ken Clarke - that she was a ""bloody difficult woman"", and laugh about it. There was also her absolute insistence that her Brexit plan is the only one in town and she is sticking to it. And finally the cold contempt, visible in her eyes, with which she addresses Boris Johnson's description of her Brexit blueprint as being akin to a ""suicide vest"" being placed around the country.

She also said there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal, including a transition period up to the end of 2020. The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Chequers worse than status quo - Johnson Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' Brexit Mrs May's proposals are unpopular with many Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Boris Johnson, who has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time, claimed last week that she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels. Mrs May said: ""I was home secretary for six years, and as prime minister for two years now I think using language like that was not right and it's not language I would have used."" Michael Gove: 'The responsibility is now on the EU' Asked if the Chequers plan was permanent, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, another leading figure in the Leave campaign, said: ""Yes, but there's one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union. ""But the Chequers approach is the right one for now because we have got to make sure that we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the European Union."" Mr Gove said the responsibility was now on the European Union ""because we've shown flexibility"". Sadiq Khan: 'The EU has already rejected Chequers' It comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan stepped up pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back a referendum on the final deal Mrs May strikes with Brussels. The Labour leadership has said it will vote against Mrs May's deal if it does not do enough to protect workers' rights and the benefits of single market and customs union membership. But Mr Corbyn has ruled out another referendum, which is backed by a trade unions and many of his MPs, saying he would prefer a general election instead. Mr Khan - who has previously ruled out a second referendum - said he did not want a ""re-run"" of the 2016 vote. He told Andrew Marr: ""The Conservative Party already has rejected Chequers, the EU has already rejected Chequers, so we are in a situation where we could slide out of the EU with no deal. ""The sensible thing is for the prime minister to call a general election, that's my first option,"" he added. But failing that, a referendum on the outcome of negotiations would allow the British public to ""take back control"".  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

"This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today challenging Theresa May's leadership is 'loose talk' Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Brexit plan have met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister. About 50 members of the European Research Group (ERG) openly discussed ""how best you game the leadership election rules,"" a source said. Eurosceptic MPs are to unveil what they say is a solution to the Irish border. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said leadership speculation was ""loose talk"" and urged MPs to unite behind the PM.

Chequers worse than status quo - Johnson Reality Check: The Brexiteers' trade plan Brexit and the hardest border Leadership speculation was ""like the weather...feature of British life"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today.

A number told the meeting in Westminster that they had already submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May. However, it is understood they are not planning an immediate move against her. A Conservative leadership contest can be triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a vote of no confidence. Are Tory MPs ready to move against May? By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.

This video can not be played IDS: âIâd stamp on any coup against PMâ With the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, the challenge has been to avoid a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member. Both sides are keen to avoid the imposition of barriers and checkpoints amid warnings of damage to cross-border trade and disruption to the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed in April 1998 and helped bring an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict, known as the Troubles. The government says its plan for ""harmonisation"" with EU trade rules and a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU will avoid friction at the border.

But critics say this would get in the way of the UK trading freely with countries outside the EU. The government's Chequers plan has not yet been accepted by the EU. Both sides have also agreed on the need for a ""backstop"" agreement to avoid new physical infrastructure on the border, irrespective of the final deal that is negotiated. 'Exports could be stuck at border' The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Why is Brexit taking sooo long? Some Brexiteers have claimed the border issue is being ""exploited"" by the EU and Remain supporters to keep the UK closely tied to Brussels. Speaking at the launch of the ""clean-break"" proposals, attended by Tory Brexiteers on Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said the border was the only thing standing in the way of the UK negotiating a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada. He added: ""It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove said ""individual criticisms"" were not helpful Theresa May should condemn Hungary's ""reactionary"" government, Labour has said, following the refusal of Tory MEPs to back a censure motion. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett urged the PM to speak out against Viktor Orban's administration. Two thirds of the European Parliament backed action against Hungary's government, which is accused of attacks on minorities and the rule of law. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the MEPs were not endorsing Mr Orban. But on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he refused to condemn the right wing prime minister directly, saying a ""long-standing principle of a number of MEPs from different countries"" was not to interfere in the ""internal democracy"" of other states. Mr Orban presents himself as the defender of Hungary and Europe against Muslim migrants. Criticised for his authoritarian style, he has told Hungarian TV: ""We will never allow Hungary to become a target country for immigrants."" What sanctions can the EU impose on Hungary? Mr Trickett said it was ""shocking"" that Conservatives had whipped their 19 MEPs to vote against the motion to censure Hungary, with only one defying the order. He said the environment secretary had declined the opportunity to distance himself from Mr Orban's ""authoritarian and anti-democratic practices"", adding: ""Theresa May should do what Gove failed to do and condemn the Hungarian government."" Viktor Orban won a third term of office this year Viktor Orban was re-elected earlier this year after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, with his Fidesz party winning two thirds of parliamentary seats. Since coming to power, his government has taken a hard-line stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"". But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system and widespread corruption. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded TheEuropean Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungaryover alleged breaches of the EU's core values, which it denies. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is not being proposed. But the EU Council - the heads of government of the member states - will now begin a process which could lead to potential recommendations being made against Hungary. After Wednesday's vote, theBoard of Deputies of British Jews said it was disappointed,externalConservative MEPs had voted in ""defence"" of Hungary, while theMuslim Council of Britain questioned,externalwhether the Tories were seeking backing for its position on Brexit in return. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell was among the Labour MPs to criticise the vote at the time, urging Theresa May to ""call out"" her MEPs. Conservative peerLord Finklestein described it as ""a really distressing thing to happen and shameful"". However, the Tory MEPshad stressed their vote should not be seen as a backing of Mr Orban.,external Mr Gove told Andrew Marr: ""It is not for me to rank a league table of EU leaders. ""It's a long-standing principle of a number of MEPs from different countries and from different parties not to believe that the European Parliament should interfere in or censure the internal democracy of a particular country."" Challenged to directly condemn Mr Orban, he said: ""You or I might have particular views about other countries but the European Parliament and those within it - British MEPs and others - believe that's the wrong way of expressing criticism."" Asked by Marr if the party needed Mr Orban's support for its Brexit plan, Mr Gove said: ""No, because I think it would be wrong for me at a time when we need solidarity against a number of different threats - you mention anti-Semitism... ""I don't believe that individual criticisms of the kind you are understandably attempting me to make necessarily help us in ensuring we get both solidarity on the issues that count and the best deal for Britain as we leave the European Union.""

"A Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" should be created to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable is proposing. He will tell the party's conference it could be built up through taxes on the richest and the sale of assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Sir Vince will say it is a ""disgrace"" taxpayers are yet to be repaid for the RBS bail-out in the financial crisis. A sovereign wealth fund would bolster public finances, he will add. Lib Dems offer home to centrists - Cable Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the2008 financial crash- warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy. A wealth fund would, he hopes, allow the UK to benefit from returns on investments typically only available to the wealthy and protect the UK from future economic crises. Explaining the policy on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he wanted to scrap inheritance tax and replace it with ""a tax on people's gifts through their lifetime"". This video can not be played Is it too late for a Lib Dem revival? Such a move was needed, he said, because ""the inequalities of wealth are massive and growing and one of the major sources of underlying dissatisfaction"". Asked about comments by former Lib Dem leader Lord Campbell, who said Sir Vince ""can see the end of the road"", he said: ""I'm not running out of road, there's a lot of road ahead."" Sir Vince has previously said he would stay on until Brexit was ""resolved or stopped"" but would be gone before the next general election in 2022. Asked if he would still be party leader by the end of next year, Sir Vince said: ""I think that's uncertain. I have a series of tasks to do. I'm going to do them. ""I'm not setting a time horizon. I think it would be foolish to do so with so much uncertainty flying around."" Sir Vince said the Lib Dems were talking to disillusioned Labour and Tory MPs, who he claimed were ready to quit their parties over Brexit. But he said setting up a new centre party was ""not a practical proposition"" and ""not going to happen"". Delegates at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton will debate wealth taxes on Tuesday. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says the policy will be an easy sell to members but it will need to find wider support if the party are to re-emerge from the margins of British politics. The Lib Dems have struggled electorally since 2010, when they formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. The party has 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said the party recognised it had to change to attract voters Sir Vince has advocated a change to the party's rules, so that someone who is not an MP could become leader, and ""liberal-minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership. Lib Dem MP Ed Davey told the BBC he backed Sir Vince's proposed reforms, saying a shake-up of the party would allow it to go ""from strength to strength"". Mr Davey said the party was united behind Sir Vince, who has announced he will stand down before the next general election due in 2022. Asked if he would stand for leader, former energy secretary Mr Davey did not rule himself out, saying: ""I'm not thinking about it at the moment, I'm thinking about supporting Vince."" Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said they had the ""ingredients to be able to challenge the other parties"". She told Sky News's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""The whole idea of a centrist party gets talked about endlessly but doesn't really get off the ground. ""You don't need to set up a new party because the Liberal Democrats are here, but we recognise that we have to change.""

However, planned shows are still due to go ahead in Cardiff, Torquay, Swansea and Liverpool in October. Center Stage Entertainment, the wrestling event's organiser, said it had written letters of complaint to the three venues and the RGA, giving them the opportunity to respond and come to an agreement out of court. A spokesman said one wrestler was deeply upset the show had been cancelled, and added he believed the UK had moved away from the ""Victorian pitch-fork mentality"" of telling people such as him they were not welcome. He added: ""The wrestlers doing the tour feel this is discrimination and that any person has the right to choose their own career path and should not be told what they can and cannot do."" Center Stage Entertainment, the wrestling event's organiser, said it has written letters of complaint to the three venues and the RGA Devizes Corn Exchange said it had not received a letter but had received an email asking the staff to reconsider.

"S1-4 and NovaSAR pictured just before being enclosed at the top of their Indian rocket The first all-British radar satellite has launched to orbit on an Indian rocket. Called NovaSAR, it has the ability to take pictures of the surface of the Earth in every kind of weather, day or night. The spacecraft will assume a number of roles but its designers specifically want to see if it can help monitor suspicious shipping activity. Lift-off from the Satish Dhawan spaceport occurred at 17:38 BST. NovaSAR was joined on its rocket by a high-resolution optical satellite - that is, an imager that sees in ordinary light. Known as S1-4, this spacecraft will discern objects on the ground as small as 87cm across. Both it and NovaSAR were manufactured by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited of Guildford. 'Suitcase space radar' returns image UK satellite makes HD movies of Earth Scotland to host first UK spaceport NovaSAR has something of the look of a cheese-grater UK engineers have long had expertise in space radar but their technology has previously always gone on broader missions, such as those for the European Space Agency. NovaSAR, which has the distinctive shape of a cheesegrater, is uniquely British, however. Its radar instrument was developed for SSTL by Airbus in Portsmouth. The mission incorporates low-cost, miniaturised components and will aim to demonstrate a more affordable approach to radar imaging. It will operate in a number of modes for applications that include the detection of oil spills, flood and forestry monitoring, disaster response, and crop assessment. Portsmouth viewed by the NovaSAR radar instrument when it was flown on an aeroplane But perhaps its most interesting role will be in maritime observation. The satellite is equipped with a receiver that can pick up Automatic Identification System (AIS) radio signals. These are the positional transmissions that large ships are obliged to broadcast under international law. Vessels that tamper with or disable these messages very often are engaged in smuggling or illegal fishing activity. If such ships appear in NovaSAR's pictures, they will be reported to the authorities. ""We are very interested in this maritime mode, which is a 400km-plus swath mode,"" said Luis Gomes, the chief technology officer at SSTL. ""It is important to be able to monitor large areas of the ocean - something we don't do at the moment. We all saw with the Malaysian airline crash in the Indian Ocean the difficulty there was in monitoring that vast area. We can do that kind of thing with radar and NovaSAR is good for that,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Luis Gomes: ""Nobody currently is monitoring vast areas of ocean"" The NovaSAR project was initiated inside SSTL in 2008/9. Back then the idea of a radar satellite that measured 3m by 1m was regarded as something of a breakthrough because, up that point, such spacecraft had been big, power-hungry beasts that cost a lot of money. It is a little unfortunate therefore that the programme got delayed because in the meantime others have also managed to package radar systems into small volumes. The Finnish start-up Iceye has a platform flying now that is the size of a suitcase. And an American company called Capella is promising a radar satellite that is not much bigger than a shoebox. But radar expert Martin Cohen from Airbus is unperturbed by these developments. ""NovaSAR is still a step change, certainly for Airbus in terms of what you can do for a particular amount of money. But while we've been waiting for a launch, we haven't stood still,"" he said. ""We've done lots of work on the next generation. ""NovaSAR is just the first in a family of instruments that will offer different capabilities, such as finer resolutions and other parameters; and we will be putting those capabilities on smaller spacecraft than NovaSAR."" S1-4 is a copy of previous SSTL optical satellites, but it will see finer detail on the ground The satellite, as presently configured, will operate in the S-band (3.2 gigahertz), giving a best resolution of 6m with a swath width of 15-20km. Future variants will go to the higher-frequency X-band and sense features on the ground as small as a metre across, and less. The Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) was programmed to put NovaSAR and S1-4 into an orbit that is 580km above the Earth.

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong Typhoon Mangkhut is lashing China's most populous province, bringing winds of up to 100 mph (162 kph). Guangdong is on its highest alert for the storm, which also hit Hong Kong, where it swayed skyscrapers and blew out windows. The death toll from the Philippines has now risen to at least 59. Most died in landslides caused by heavy rain. Mangkhut, considered the strongest storm of 2018, ploughed through the northern Philippines on Saturday. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon local time, state media reported. In pictures: Deadly typhoon hits China More than 2.45 million people have been relocated, and authorities there issued their highest warning level, a red alert. Typhoon Mangkhut brought flooding to Hong Kong Waves crashed against the Hung Hom Promenade in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, authorities also issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (177 kph). Officials put the number of injured at more than 200 but the territory avoided the worst of the storm. Water levels surged by almost 3.5 m (12 ft) in places and live fish were washed on to the streets. Most shops and public services were shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. ""I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,"" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Mangkhut is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday as it moves inland. Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut has destroyed more than 750 buildings in this town in the Philippines. One of the worst incidents was in Itogon municipality, where accommodation for miners was crushed by a large landslide, killing at least 26, according to police. Eight more people are missing there. Officials say that two first responders reported on Saturday to have been killed in a landslide in Cordillera province have been accounted for. The BBC's Howard Johnson travelled 80km (50 miles) from the city of Tuguegarao to Aparri on the northern coast. He describes a trail of destruction along the route - forests ripped to shreds, electricity poles felled and crops eradicated. Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm What are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons? There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Landslides claimed most of the victims in the Philippines The full impact is still emerging Preparation and evacuation procedures have improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. How have you been affected by the typhoon? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"A Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" should be created to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable is proposing. He will tell the party's conference it could be built up through taxes on the richest and the sale of assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Sir Vince will say it is a ""disgrace"" taxpayers are yet to be repaid for the RBS bail-out in the financial crisis. A sovereign wealth fund would bolster public finances, he will add. Lib Dems offer home to centrists - Cable Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the2008 financial crash- warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy. A wealth fund would, he hopes, allow the UK to benefit from returns on investments typically only available to the wealthy and protect the UK from future economic crises. Explaining the policy on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he wanted to scrap inheritance tax and replace it with ""a tax on people's gifts through their lifetime"". This video can not be played Is it too late for a Lib Dem revival? Such a move was needed, he said, because ""the inequalities of wealth are massive and growing and one of the major sources of underlying dissatisfaction"". Asked about comments by former Lib Dem leader Lord Campbell, who said Sir Vince ""can see the end of the road"", he said: ""I'm not running out of road, there's a lot of road ahead."" Sir Vince has previously said he would stay on until Brexit was ""resolved or stopped"" but would be gone before the next general election in 2022. Asked if he would still be party leader by the end of next year, Sir Vince said: ""I think that's uncertain. I have a series of tasks to do. I'm going to do them. ""I'm not setting a time horizon. I think it would be foolish to do so with so much uncertainty flying around."" Sir Vince said the Lib Dems were talking to disillusioned Labour and Tory MPs, who he claimed were ready to quit their parties over Brexit. But he said setting up a new centre party was ""not a practical proposition"" and ""not going to happen"". Delegates at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton will debate wealth taxes on Tuesday. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says the policy will be an easy sell to members but it will need to find wider support if the party are to re-emerge from the margins of British politics. The Lib Dems have struggled electorally since 2010, when they formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. The party has 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said the party recognised it had to change to attract voters Sir Vince has advocated a change to the party's rules, so that someone who is not an MP could become leader, and ""liberal-minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership. Lib Dem MP Ed Davey told the BBC he backed Sir Vince's proposed reforms, saying a shake-up of the party would allow it to go ""from strength to strength"". Mr Davey said the party was united behind Sir Vince, who has announced he will stand down before the next general election due in 2022. Asked if he would stand for leader, former energy secretary Mr Davey did not rule himself out, saying: ""I'm not thinking about it at the moment, I'm thinking about supporting Vince."" Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said they had the ""ingredients to be able to challenge the other parties"". She told Sky News's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""The whole idea of a centrist party gets talked about endlessly but doesn't really get off the ground. ""You don't need to set up a new party because the Liberal Democrats are here, but we recognise that we have to change."" Lib Dems offer home to centrists - Cable Cable proposes new hurdle to independence Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Miller rules out bid to be Lib Dem leader New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Dudley Sutton played Tinker Dill in 70 episodes of the BBC hit Lovejoy Actor Dudley Sutton, known to millions as Tinker Dill from TV's Lovejoy, has died aged 85. A veteran of the small and big screen, he starred opposite Ian McShane's roguish antiques dealer in the BBC comedy-drama from 1986 to 1994. Former colleagues and co-stars paid tribute to the ""great actor and wonderful bloke"", who was diagnosed with cancer this year. Sutton's agent said he died peacefully surrounded by friends and family. Born in Surrey in April 1933, he served as an RAF mechanic before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He was later expelled, but went on to join legendary stage director Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop group. After appearing in numerous plays during the 1950s and 1960s, Sutton's breakout screen role was the part of a gay biker in 1964's the Leather Boys. He later appeared in films such as The Devils, and The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Sutton starred alongside Ian McShane's titular antiques dealer (centre), and Chris Jury (left) But, speaking last year, Sutton acknowledged most audiences would remember him as Tinker, ""regardless of all the different and diverse stuff"" he had worked on. His other TV appearances included a special Christmas episode of BBC sitcom Porridge, in which he played hostage-taker Reg Urwin, and an instalment of ITV crime drama The Sweeney. In his later career he had a recurring role as conman Wilfred Atkins in EastEnders, as well as smaller parts in Holby City and Channel 4's teen drama Skins. Sutton died at the Royal Trinity Hospice in Clapham, south London. In July this year, he recorded a message from his bed praising staff at the NHS-run hospice, who he said had ""cared for him beautifully"". A message from his family said: ""Today we're devastated by the loss of our beautiful Dudley, who leaves a gaping hole in all our lives. ""We're grateful for the love expressed by friends and fans everywhere and for the extraordinary care he received at the [hospice], where he went out fighting for our NHS."" Former co-stars and showbiz friends also paid tribute to Sutton on social media. Fellow Lovejoy star Chris Jury, who played Eric Catchpole in the show, said he loved the actor ""dearly"".

"Tropical storm Florence is continuing to unload inches, and even feet, of rain in places US east coast communities face ""epic amounts of rainfall"" from storm Florence, which has been linked to at least 12 deaths. It has caused catastrophic flooding since arriving as a category one hurricane on Friday. Some towns have already seen 2ft (60cm) of rain in two days, with totals forecast to top 3.5ft (1m) in places. It is feared that more communities could become deluged as the storm crawls west at only 2mph (3km/h). Florence, which started out as a hurricane, has now weakened to a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Sunday, but flash flooding and river floods will continue over a significant portion of the Carolinas.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

"This video can not be played Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines The Philippines is counting the human and economic cost of Typhoon Mangkhut, which ripped through its main island with deadly consequences on Saturday. At least 25 people are known to have died but blocked roads and downed communications lines mean the true impact on rural areas is not yet clear. Extensive crop damage is feared in the agricultural province of Cagayan. The storm, which packs a 900km (550 mile) rain band and strong winds, is heading towards southern China. It poses a ""severe threat"" to Hong Kong,external, the territory's observatory said, urging residents to stay on high alert. The storm is approaching Hong Kong Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm In the Philippines, it made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the main island of Luzon, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday) and left some 20 hours later. Originally a super typhoon billed as the strongest storm of 2018, it lost some of its strength on landfall. Five million people were in its path and more than 100,000 sheltered in temporary centres. Francis Tolentino, a presidential spokesman and disaster response coordinator, said almost all the deaths had been caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions. He added that reports from other areas were still coming in. One person was killed by a falling tree in the province of Ilocos Sur, Mr Tolentino said. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, Santiago, Cagayan Well-planned evacuations appear to have minimised casualties in the areas directly in the path of this powerful storm. Nothing though has yet been heard from some more isolated communities. But the huge volume of rain brought by the typhoon has caused numerous landslides, some fatal. This part of the Philippines is mountainous and severely deforested - landslides are a constant danger. The popular resort town of Baguio, well away from the eye of the storm, has been badly affected. President Rodrigo Duterte is flying over the northern Philippines today to assess the damage; perceived failure to respond adequately to a previous typhoon hurt the political standing of his predecessor. Aside from human casualties and the widespread destruction of housing and infrastructure, there is also concern over the longer-term impact on agriculture in this important food-producing area. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao, Cagayan's provincial capital, sustained damage, a government official said. Francis Tolentino, political adviser to President Duterte, told the BBC that there was also extensive crop damage in the agricultural heartland state. There are fears about damage to crops in the agricultural heartland of Cagayan He estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines The Philippine Red Cross chairman, Richard Gordon, told the BBC on Saturday that the country was not yet safe of danger. ""After the winds come the rains, comes the water, so the next problems that we have to face are floods and access to these areas again,"" he said. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season but the strength of Manghukt evoked memories of the deadliest storm on national record - Super Typhoon Haiyan - which killed more than 7,000 in 2013. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then - warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. Mangkhut is still strong as it heads west toward southern China with current sustained wind speeds of 145km/h but fears it will re-strengthen into a super typhoon have receded. Authorities there have upgraded their warning level to a signal ten - the highest level - meaning residents should stay indoors to avoid any flying debris. BBC News' Robin Brant said that the city is now ""pretty much shut down"", although some cars remain on the roads. Most shops and public services are shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. The passing storm is being felt in Hong Kong on Sunday Antoine Li, a government official at an emergency centre in the fishing village of Tai O on Hong Kong's Lantau Island, said residents must not underestimate the storm. ""This typhoon will be very dangerous as it will arrive when everyone is sleeping and there is no way to leave so we have called on residents to leave the village before it gets dark,"" he told Reuters news agency.

"This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong Typhoon Mangkhut is lashing China's most populous province, bringing winds of up to 100 mph (162 kph). Guangdong is on its highest alert for the storm, which also hit Hong Kong, where it swayed skyscrapers and blew out windows. The death toll from the Philippines has now risen to at least 59. Most died in landslides caused by heavy rain. Mangkhut, considered the strongest storm of 2018, ploughed through the northern Philippines on Saturday. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast,externalnear Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon local time, state media reported. In pictures: Deadly typhoon hits China More than 2.45 million people have been relocated, and authorities there issued their highest warning level, a red alert. Typhoon Mangkhut brought flooding to Hong Kong Waves crashed against the Hung Hom Promenade in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, authorities also issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (177 kph). Officials put the number of injured at more than 200 but the territory avoided the worst of the storm. Water levels surged by almost 3.5 m (12 ft) in places and live fish were washed on to the streets. Most shops and public services were shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. ""I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,"" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Mangkhut is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday as it moves inland. Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut has destroyed more than 750 buildings in this town in the Philippines. One of the worst incidents was in Itogon municipality, where accommodation for miners was crushed by a large landslide, killing at least 26, according to police. Eight more people are missing there. Officials say that two first responders reported on Saturday to have been killed in a landslide in Cordillera province have been accounted for. The BBC's Howard Johnson travelled 80km (50 miles) from the city of Tuguegarao to Aparri on the northern coast.

"Alvarez won the last round on two cards which proved key Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez claimed the WBC and WBA world middleweight titles by inflicting a first career defeat on Gennady Golovkin with a gripping points win in their Las Vegas rematch. The Mexican claimed a frenetic final round on two of the three scorecards which was critical in preventing a repeat of the draw both men shared 364 days earlier at the same T-Mobile Arena venue. It gave him a narrow a 114-114 115-113 115-113 majority decision to edge a contest in which both men were cut and where each showed why they are among the finest practitioners in the sport. Golovkin, whose first defeat comes in his 40th bout, left the ring immediately without conducting an interview as his rival - fighting for the first time since serving a six-month drugs ban - celebrated. ""My corner told me I needed to win the final round and that's what I did. I'm very emotional,"" said Alvarez, who has previously held world titles at middleweight and light-middleweight. Golovkin told reporters afterwards: ""I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo according to the judges. I thought I fought better than he did. We would like to have a third fight, we will negotiate that, that's what we want."" 5 live Boxing podcast: Canelo wins - just How Golovkin lost for the first time All three judges had Canelo (left) leading 4-2 after six rounds Alvarez looked close to tears after a decision which will again prompt controversy as, for spells in the fight, Golovkin seemed to be edging the physical side of a tactical battle, with his jab proving key early on. But with scoring already criticised in their first bout before Alvarez's two failed doping tests in February, it is perhaps not surprising that once again controversy will remain attached to this rivalry, with demand for a third meeting almost guaranteed. Few could argue the hype surrounding their second meeting was not justified as the bout ebbed and flowed. Celebrities including actors Will Smith and Denzel Washington, and sports stars such as Mike Tyson and LeBron James, sat ringside as more than 21,000 inside the arena were taken in by a bout in which neither man looked like capitulating even when under solid attack. After Golovkin's poised jab clearly won the opening three minutes, Alvarez's response in the second - including a solid right uppercut - pointed to the back-and-forth contest that was to come. All four judges gave 'Canelo' four of the opening six rounds despite some of the more eye-catching work coming from Kazakhstan's Golovkin, who landed a notable left hook in the fourth. Alvarez is once again a middleweight world champion and has also held world titles at light-middleweight But Alvarez - who sustained a cut above his left eye which worsened as the bout developed - visibly began to close distance in order to nullify Golovkin's jab. At times their heads were almost touching, bringing hooks and uppercuts into focus, and Golovkin sustained his own cut from a head collision. Alvarez, a man steeped in the art of fighting with six brothers who also hold professional boxing records, remained game in walking forward repeatedly, a contrast to his a largely back-foot performance last time. His mother was pictured praying at ringside after a ninth round which saw both men launch repeated attacks and Alvarez almost came unstuck in the 10th as a left hook to his jaw briefly rendered him limp, only for him to somehow quickly rediscover his poise. But his work up close perhaps won the judges over. Ringside stats showed Alvarez landed 46 body punches compared to six from his rival but after landing a right to the body and left to the face in the final round, he ate two uppercuts in the closing 10 seconds as both men responded to the noise around them. They embraced before each raising their hands but the cards prompted Mexican celebration on the country's Independence weekend. ""If the people want another fight then we'll do it again,"" said Alvarez, beaten only by Floyd Mayweather in a 53-fight career. ""We'll do it, no doubt."" Alvarez looked to the sky as he was declared the winner Former super-lightweight world champion Amir Khan:""What a fight. I gave the fight to Canelo. It was toe-to-toe action. Very exciting. Canelo surprised us all with the come forward pressure game plan. Well done to both Canelo and GGG. Boxing needed this."" LA Lakers basketball player LeBron James:""One of the best fights I've ever seen! Ultimate competitors in Canelo and Triple-G! Salute to the both of you. Could watch y'all fight any day."" Former world heavyweight champion George Foreman:""Canelo Brave as a Bull! Congrats! Made a puncher Box. I didn't expect this. Need one more between these great fighters."" Northern Irish featherweight Michael Conlan:""I don't think it was robbery, had Canelo winning and I really wanted Triple-G to win. Some very close rounds that could have gone either way. Canelo's body work, sharp counters and punch output stole it for me. Great fight with two great champions!"" Sydney 2000 Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison:""I just can't see that result - Canelo did a great job but he didn't do enough to win in my opinion. Great fight, but GGG can feel that decision should have gone his way. No third fight for at least a year guys (long rest)."" Northern Irish featherweight Carl Frampton:""In hindsight a lot of the rounds were close. I edged to Triple-G but can we please applaud the smaller man Canelo's chin."" Golovkin's jab helped him win the opening round on all three cards BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello in Las Vegas: In essence the judges were only one round adrift and that's how close it was. Controversy will be generated. There are bound to be boxing fans out there who felt Canelo won and there will be loads of people shaking their heads. All judges were in agreement for the first six rounds, it was 4-2 at that stage and we ringside had it the other way around to Golovkin. There will be an awful lot of talk for the next few weeks and that is one upside for the sport. It wouldn't have got this amount of talk had it not been a controversial result. If the third fight does happen, you would imagine it would happen back here in May next year.

"Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has said she never wants to be prime minister because she values her ""mental health too much"". In an interview with the Sunday Times Magazine,,externalshe revealed her struggles with self-harm, suicidal thoughts and depression as a teenager. The MSP, who is expecting her first child, also ruled out a peerage or becoming an MP at Westminster. She said the idea of leaving her child in Edinburgh was ""actually offensive"". Ms Davidson announced she and her partner Jen Wilson wereexpecting a baby in April, after undergoing IVF treatment. She is expected to give birth in October, and has announced her plans to take four or five months of maternity leave. This video can not be played Ruth Davidson in April 2018: 'I'm delighted to say we're starting a family' Ruling out taking the helm at Downing Street, the 39-year-old, who is releasing her memoirs in the paper, said: ""You have to want it, and I don't want to be prime minister"". In 2016, while David Cameron was PM, she described the role as ""the loneliest job in the world"". Who is Ruth Davidson? Davidson: PM critics must 'quit the noise' Speaking frankly about her teenage years, Ms Davidson said her mental heath suffered after a boy from her village took his own life when she was 17 years old. ""I went into a total tailspin"", she said. She said she started cutting herself, ""punching walls... drinking far, far, too much and becoming belligerent and angry"".

The MSP said she combated her mental health issues by exercising regularly, moderating her alcohol intake, going back to church, and ""most importantly to me, I threw away my pills"". But she said she was still ""frightened of going back to the psychological place [she] once inhabited"". ""When I have a period of heightened anxiety, or I can feel the weight of the black blanket start to descend, I go back to what I know works for me: structure, exercise, forward momentum, measurable outcomes.

Toni Giugliano, policy manager at the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: ""Ruth's decision to speak out takes courage and will hopefully encourage others to do the same.""

"Patients are facing delays in diagnosis because of severe shortages among pathology staff, according to a report seen by the BBC. A survey by the Royal College of Pathologists found only 3% of the NHS histopathology departments that responded had enough staff. Histopathologists are doctors and scientists who diagnose and study diseases such as cancer. Hundreds more pathologists are now working in the NHS, health chiefs said. Sandra Ratcliffe waited a month for her test results due to staffing problems Sandra Ratcliffe from South Ayrshire was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. She had an operation to remove the tumour, but had two appointments cancelled and had to wait a month for test results to determine how serious her cancer was, whether it had spread and what further treatment she would need. The hospital told her that the delays were due to staffing shortages in its pathology department. She told 5 Live Investigates: ""It was probably the most distressing month of my life. ""As every day went on, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I was just consumed until I got the results and was able to move on with my treatment. It's difficult to explain just how awful that feeling is."" Sandra had radiotherapy and chemotherapy and has now been told she is free from cancer. A spokesperson for NHS Ayrshire and Arran told the programme it worked to a number of quality measures, including turnaround times, and apologised for where it had not met those standards. It said it had experienced difficulties recruiting consultant pathologists. The new report by the Royal College of Pathologists says that demand for pathology services has grown significantly in recent years, but staffing has not increased at the same rate. It carried out a workforce survey of histopathology departments throughout the UK in 2017. Of the 158 departments, 103 responded. Only 3% said they had enough staff to meet current clinical demand. And 45% of departments had to outsource work while half of departments were forced to use locums. NHS vacancies a 'national emergency' 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble ""The cost of staff shortages across histopathology departments is high for both patients and for our health services. ""For patients, it means worrying delays in diagnosis and treatment,"" said Prof Jo Martin, president of the Royal College of Pathologists. ""We estimate the cost of locums and outsourcing work is Â£27m each year across the UK health service, money that could be better invested in staff and new diagnostic equipment"" she added. Histopathologists analyse cell and tissue samples for diseases such as cancer The report says histopathologists are facing intense pressure from increasing workloads due to new NHS screening programmes. It also warns of an approaching retirement crisis - with a quarter of all staff aged 55 or over. ""If this trend continues unchecked, clinical services could be in jeopardy,"" Prof Martin said. ""Making sure pathology services can cope with current and future demand is essential if we are to ensure early diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients."" The college is calling for more funded training places, better IT systems and further investment in pathology services. Histopathologists are doctors and scientists who diagnose and study disease using their expertise to interpret cell and tissue samples, for example, breast lumps or specimens of bowel removed because of suspected cancer. They look at tissues and cells removed from patients in the clinic or during an operation. Using a range of scientific methods, they assess if a disease is present and what course of action needs to be taken. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""There are hundreds more pathologists in the NHS compared to 2010 and hospitals have reduced spending on temporary agency staff by over half a billion pounds in the last year. ""We are listening to staff, encouraging more flexible working and have increased medical training places for home-grown doctors by 25%, to ensure the NHS has the workforce it needs for the future."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said it was facing challenges in recruiting pathologists but was developing a plan to address the issue.

"This video can not be played David Edwards was killed by his wife just weeks after their wedding Male domestic abuse victims are suffering a lack of support despite a sharp rise in attacks, a charity said. Police in England and Wales recorded 149,248 incidents in 2017 - more than double the number reported in 2012. One charity, the ManKind Initiative, said while a third of domestic abuse victims were men, only 0.8% of refuge beds were reserved for them. The Home Office urged ""all victims to come forward and report this horrific crime"" and said support was available. The charity, which helps men escaping abuse, told the BBC while there more than 3,600 beds in safe houses for women, there were currently only 20 earmarked solely for men in England, including none in London. While one in six men will experience domestic abuse at some point in their lives, only one in 20 will ever seek any help, the ManKind Initiative said. Spokesman Mark Brooks told BBC 5 live Afternoon Edition while more victims were beginning to come forward, a ""failure to ensure a basic level of support across the country will fail those men and, of course, fail their children where they are involved."" The charity said some men were having to travel more than 150 miles to get help and has called for dedicated support across the UK. According to data obtained by BBC Inside Out North West, over the past five years, domestic abuse reports have surged 352% across Greater Manchester to 8,988 in 2017, tripled in Merseyside (to 3,184) and Cheshire (to 2,533), and increased 70% in Lancashire (to 2,231). For 15 years, Tony - whose full name we have agreed not to use - says he was systematically abused in a same-sex relationship. He said he was beaten, isolated from his friends, prevented from working or even owning a mobile phone. He told the BBC how he had managed to escape. ""I found an old mobile phone and I made phone calls to the domestic abuse helpline. I pretended I was going for a walk or was going shopping. ""They said 'you have to leave, it's very very important you get out of this relationship'. The government is introducing a bill that will define domestic abuse ""I must have left at three o'clock in the morning. I waited around for a taxi for a couple of hours in the churchyard, freezing cold. It took me to the nearest train station and I hopped on a train and came here (to a safe house)."" It took four months there for Tony to feel strong enough to find a place of his own. ""I still feel ashamed even today to admit I was in an abusive relationship,"" he said. ""I think it's something to do with being a man. You're supposed to stand up for yourself, you're supposed to protect yourself. ""You hear a lot about women's groups and of course women and children are always going to get priority but men also need help."" Senior psychology lecturer Elizabeth Bates, of Cumbria University, said: ""That is likely to be the tip of the iceberg - I think there are a lot of men who have experienced domestic violence and don't ever report it and often don't tell anybody. ""I think there's lots of reasons men don't ask for help. ""In terms of the services that are available, they often don't look like they provide support for men and even though often they do and I think a lot of the time it's because the campaigns and things that we have around domestic violence often are really geared towards women and women victims."" 'Too frightened to leave the house' Hidden male victims of domestic abuse Domestic abuse refuge for men opens A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are determined to ensure anyone facing the threat of domestic abuse has somewhere to turn to, and that police have the tools to deal with perpetrators of this abuse. We strongly urge all victims to come forward and report this horrific crime, regardless of their gender or that of their abuser. ""The Home Office funds the Men's Advice Line, a confidential, free phone helpline for male victims of domestic abuse. The service offers practical advice, information and emotional support to male victims, as well as to concerned friends and family and frontline workers. ""Our Domestic Abuse Bill will introduce the first ever government definition of domestic abuse recognising the many kinds of abuse suffered - psychological, physical, sexual, economic and emotional. This will help to improve understanding among frontline professionals, law enforcement officers and prosecutors.""

"Patients are facing delays in diagnosis because of severe shortages among pathology staff, according to a report seen by the BBC. A survey by the Royal College of Pathologists found only 3% of the NHS histopathology departments that responded had enough staff. Histopathologists are doctors and scientists who diagnose and study diseases such as cancer. Hundreds more pathologists are now working in the NHS, health chiefs said. Sandra Ratcliffe waited a month for her test results due to staffing problems Sandra Ratcliffe from South Ayrshire was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. She had an operation to remove the tumour, but had two appointments cancelled and had to wait a month for test results to determine how serious her cancer was, whether it had spread and what further treatment she would need. The hospital told her that the delays were due to staffing shortages in its pathology department. She told 5 Live Investigates: ""It was probably the most distressing month of my life. ""As every day went on, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I was just consumed until I got the results and was able to move on with my treatment. It's difficult to explain just how awful that feeling is."" Sandra had radiotherapy and chemotherapy and has now been told she is free from cancer. A spokesperson for NHS Ayrshire and Arran told the programme it worked to a number of quality measures, including turnaround times, and apologised for where it had not met those standards. It said it had experienced difficulties recruiting consultant pathologists. The new report by the Royal College of Pathologists says that demand for pathology services has grown significantly in recent years, but staffing has not increased at the same rate. It carried out a workforce survey of histopathology departments throughout the UK in 2017. Of the 158 departments, 103 responded. Only 3% said they had enough staff to meet current clinical demand. And 45% of departments had to outsource work while half of departments were forced to use locums. NHS vacancies a 'national emergency' 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble ""The cost of staff shortages across histopathology departments is high for both patients and for our health services. ""For patients, it means worrying delays in diagnosis and treatment,"" said Prof Jo Martin, president of the Royal College of Pathologists. ""We estimate the cost of locums and outsourcing work is Â£27m each year across the UK health service, money that could be better invested in staff and new diagnostic equipment"" she added. Histopathologists analyse cell and tissue samples for diseases such as cancer The report says histopathologists are facing intense pressure from increasing workloads due to new NHS screening programmes. It also warns of an approaching retirement crisis - with a quarter of all staff aged 55 or over. ""If this trend continues unchecked, clinical services could be in jeopardy,"" Prof Martin said. ""Making sure pathology services can cope with current and future demand is essential if we are to ensure early diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients."" The college is calling for more funded training places, better IT systems and further investment in pathology services. Histopathologists are doctors and scientists who diagnose and study disease using their expertise to interpret cell and tissue samples, for example, breast lumps or specimens of bowel removed because of suspected cancer. They look at tissues and cells removed from patients in the clinic or during an operation. Using a range of scientific methods, they assess if a disease is present and what course of action needs to be taken. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""There are hundreds more pathologists in the NHS compared to 2010 and hospitals have reduced spending on temporary agency staff by over half a billion pounds in the last year. ""We are listening to staff, encouraging more flexible working and have increased medical training places for home-grown doctors by 25%, to ensure the NHS has the workforce it needs for the future."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said it was facing challenges in recruiting pathologists but was developing a plan to address the issue. The Scottish government said it had increased training places in pathology specialisms in the last three years and was considering a request for additional pathology trainees for 2019. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, 16 September at 11:00 BST - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness recount the scene after the 'mariachi' fled Gunmen dressed as traditional mariachi musicians have killed five people and wounded eight in Mexico City, sending onlookers fleeing. They opened fire at a road crossing on the edge of the Plaza Garibaldi, a major tourist attraction packed with mariachi bars, police said. The gunmen then fled from the scene on motorbikes. Plaza Garibaldi borders the notorious Tepito district, home to the violent La UniÃ³n drugs gang. Two of those killed had convictions for robbery, AFP news agency reports, quoting a local official. Musicians stood around looking at the crime scene afterwards ""You come completely relaxed and to have a good time and then suddenly there are gunshots,"" one tourist in the area told Reuters news agency.

Florence made landfall in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Friday morning as a category one hurricane. It was downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

"Luke Massella, aged 10 in 2001 with his mother and uncle, had to undergo surgery many times Bioprinting human tissue using specialised 3D printers promises to transform medicine, with implications for organ transplants, cancer treatment and antibiotic development. Luke Massella is one of about 10 people alive walking around with a replacement bladder that has been grown from his own cells. He was born with a condition called spina bifida, which, from birth, left a gap in his spine. By 10 years old, he had survived a dozen surgeries and beaten doctors' initial expectations that he'd never walk. But then a malfunctioning bladder made his kidneys fail. ""I was kind of facing the possibility I might have to do dialysis [blood purification via machine] for the rest of my life,"" he says. ""I wouldn't be able to play sports, and have the normal kid life with my brother."" An enterprising surgeon, Anthony Atala at Boston Children's Hospital, took a small piece of Luke's bladder, and over two months grew a new one in the lab. Then in a 14-hour surgical procedure he replaced the defective bladder with the new one. Dr Atala has pioneered growing replacement body tissue and organs in the laboratory ""So it was pretty much like getting a bladder transplant, but from my own cells, so you don't have to deal with rejection,"" says Luke. Rejection is when the body's immune system attacks transplanted cells that come from another organism. Using tissue grown from a patient's own cells helps combat this effect. Luke went on to be a wrestling coach in the Connecticut public schools and now, at 27, runs events in the jewellery industry. ""Pretty much I was able to live a normal life after,"" he says. He underwent surgery 17 times before he was 13, but hasn't had to since. Dr Atala's work involves bioprinting, using modified 3D inkjet machines to produce biological tissue. His team has developed ""eight cell-based tissues we put into patients,"" he says, including engineered skin, urethras, and cartilage, all grown in the lab. Bioprinters can help create organic replacement body parts like this urethra in the making These engineered organs are going through clinical trials for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. ""You need to know how to make these organs by hand, then the bioprinter is really a scale-up tool,"" says Dr Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina. In other words, bioprinting would enable these organs to be made in an affordable, consistent, and precisely constructed way, he believes. ""Flat structures like skin"" are easiest to print, he says. Then ""tubular structures like blood vessels and urethras"" are a little more complex, with ""hollow non-tubular organs like bladders"" harder still. But hardest are ""solid organs like hearts, lungs, and kidneys,"" with ""so many more cells per centimetre"". For these highly complex organs bioprinters provide a precision that surpasses human hands, he says. Bioprinting has taken off following a dramatic discovery by Shinya Yamanaka and Sir John Gurdon, who  a Nobel Prize for their work in 2012. Adult ordinary cells can now be reprogrammed to make stem cells - called induced pluripotent stem cells - which can be used to make any other cell in the body. ""A lot has happened in the last couple of years,"" says Steven Morris, chief executive of bioprinting start-up Biolife4d. Mr Morris is working to bioprint a heart using these pluripotent cells over the next year. This will initially be a smaller version of the organ, he explains, but could eventually help pharmaceutical companies bypass testing trial drugs on animals, he says. And ultimately, bioprinting organs from people's own cells will solve the ""huge lack of supply"" in organs for transplant, says Mr Morris, and do away with the need for anti-rejection immunosuppressant drugs. Specialist printers could even reproduce cancers tumours, giving doctors the chance to test ""which treatment could specifically work on that patient,"" says Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Swedish start-up Cellink. Bioprinters are becoming more sophisticated as the technology develops His firm has been given a â¬2.5m ($2.9m; Â£2.2m) grant from the European Union to develop these tumour-modelling printers. Bioprinters also give us a way of ""quickly laying down small quantities of fluid to test if a new antibiotic would work for that specific patient,"" says Annette Friskopp, vice president for specialty printing systems at the large tech firm HP in Palo Alto. This could help tackle the growing and serious problem of antimicrobial resistance - the rise of ""superbugs"" traditional antibiotics can't kill. HP is partnering with the US Center for Disease Control to deploy printers in four regional labs in the US this autumn. Printers of any kind need ink, and bioprinters are no different. ""Bioink"" is a gel that can be extruded through a printing nozzle and mimics the suspension lying between cells, called the extracellular matrix. Both university labs and start-ups, such as Cellink, have been developing bioinks that can be used with many types of cells, says Ahu Arslan Yildiz, a biochemist who heads a research group at Izmir Institute of Technology in western Turkey. Ahu Arslan Yildiz holds up a bioprinted cancer tumour And these ""universal"" bioinks are growing more and more ""processable and easy to handle,"" says Ms Yildiz, while also not being toxic. Another breakthrough in the fast-developing field comes from Japan. Most bioprinting uses a scaffold to hold cells in place. And once cells are ""coaxed to a certain level, they begin to self organise and assemble,"" says Arnold Kriegstein, director of the stem cells and regeneration medicine centre at the University of California, San Francisco. The scaffold can then be removed. Are 'swipe left' dating apps bad for our mental health? The race to make the world's most powerful computer ever 'My robot makes me feel like I haven't been forgotten' How did Coca-Cola put fizz into its World Cup sales? Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency But Koichi Nakayama, at Saga University in southern Japan, has been developing a way to create 3D tissue without scaffolds. Instead, he lances small spheres on a fine array of needles, called a kenzan. Dr Nakayama, a doctor and chairman of the university's Regenerative Medicine and Biomedical Engineering department, is now ""preparing the first human trial in our university"" to implant dialysis tubes ""just made from a patient's own skin cells"". So bioprinting is making huge strides and promising to give many of us a new lease of life.

"This rollercoaster was stuck 50ft (15m) in the air Twenty-one people, including several children, were rescued after a rollercoaster at the Gulliver's World theme park became stuck. Fire crews used ladders and scaffolding to rescue the stranded passengers, which stopped 50ft (15m) in the air. Crews were called to the venue in Warrington, Cheshire, at about 13:10 BST and spent about two hours rescuing the passengers. Witnesses described seeing crying children on the ride. A mother described how it stalled while her seven-year-old daughter was on the rollercoaster. ""Two wheels came off the ride and it stopped suddenly. ""Kids were screaming and staff just stood there basically not knowing what to do for 20 minutes,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named. ""I'm just glad she's safe but as a mother it was one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. ""The ride looks unsafe and needs to be shut."" Firefighters used two ropes to lower three people to safety, and said everyone had been rescued by just after 15:30 BST. A Cheshire Fire & Rescue Service spokeswoman said no-one was injured in the incident. Gulliver's World could not be reached for comment.

"This video can not be played Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines Some 14 people have been killed in a massive storm which brought destruction to the northern Philippines, a presidential adviser says. Typhoon Mangkhut ripped through the Philippines' main island of Luzon, and is now moving west towards China. The storm tore off roofs, felled trees, triggered 42 landslides and caused extensive flooding. Mangkhut unleashed winds of 185km/h (115mph) as it careered from east to west across the north of Luzon. Five million people were in its path, and thousands were evacuated. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao - the capital city of the north-eastern Cagayan province - sustained some damage, a government official said, and communications were down in places. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, said up to 14 people were killed as a result of the storm. Two rescuers died trying to help people trapped in a landslide. Unverified reports say the body of a young girl was found in the Marikina river, which flows through Manila. Residents of Gonzaga province after a night in an evacuation centre The mayor of the Baguio City said five people were killed there. Mauricio Domogan told CNN Philippines a similar number were also missing and the sewerage system was being overwhelmed by the floodwaters. The evacuation centre in the coastal town of Aparri is said to have been destroyed and phone networks are down. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is in Luzon, saw 200 people who had taken shelter in one school being re-evacuated because a dyke holding back a swollen river was about to burst. The full cost of Typhoon Mangkhut on one of the country's most important food-producing regions cannot yet be assessed, he says. The typhoon recalls memories of the deadliest storm on record in the Philippines - Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 - which killed more than 7,000. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then. In pictures: Typhoon lashes Philippines Lawyer in Tuguegarao: Some are in a daze How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the Philippines, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday), and left the country some 20 hours later. After losing some of its wind speed over land as it headed west, the storm was downgraded from a super typhoon. It is forecast to weaken slightly as it approaches China from the south-east. The storm - known locally as Ompong - has a cloud diameter of about 900km and is heading west at about 30km/h. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) billed the storm asthe strongest tropical cyclone the world has faced so far this year,external. Some residents of Aparri were still able to amuse themselves Inhabitants of Alcala inspected damage The typhoon is forecast to pass near Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. In nearby Macau, shops have been boarded up and residents have been sticking tape on their windows. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Authorities in the Philippines have said they were better prepared for the storm than in previous years. Warnings were issued in dozens of provinces. Travel by sea and air was restricted. Flights were cancelled, schools shut and the army was on standby.

Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. Fears that Mangkhut may be classed as a super typhoon again when it reaches Hong Kong on Sunday have receded, though it is still forecast to be a strong storm. Residents have been preparing. Tape has been stuck to the windows, creating ominous X-shapes on the front of homes and offices, and some bamboo scaffolding also appears to have been taken down or secured as a precaution. Fishermen in China remove their boat to safety as the typhoon approaches Hong Kong residents buy tape to secure their windows People are being told to stay indoors. Antoine Li, a government official at an emergency centre in the village of Tai O on the western coast of Hong Kong's Lantau island, said residents must not underestimate the storm. ""This typhoon will be very dangerous as it will arrive when everyone is sleeping and there is no way to leave. So we have called on residents to leave the village before it gets dark,"" he told Reuters news agency. A shop owner in the village said: ""Everyone is scared of the typhoon this time, very scared"", and they are more worried about the elderly living in stilt houses, who insisted on staying.

The evacuation centre in the town is said to have been destroyed and phone networks are down. Some in Aparri however found amusement amid the waves. The storm packed winds of 185km/h (115mph). Four million people were in its path, and thousands were evacuated amid warnings of 6m (20ft) storm surges. Residents of Gonzaga in north-eastern Luzon were evacuated to shelters. In nearby Gattaran residents scrambled to recover reusable items after the storm destroyed homes. Almost all buildings in the city of Tuguegarao sustained some damage, a government official said, including the city's airport. On Luzon's western coast, buildings in the town of Laoag were also left badly damaged. Further south there was heavy flooding in San Mateo, east of the capital Manila. An evacuation centre was set up for those forced to flee their homes in nearby Marikina. Manila was also affected, with waves seen here splashing over the sea wall on the city's Roxas Boulevard. The typhoon is now moving west towards China. Here sea water is seen being sucked into the air off the eastern coast of Taiwan.
