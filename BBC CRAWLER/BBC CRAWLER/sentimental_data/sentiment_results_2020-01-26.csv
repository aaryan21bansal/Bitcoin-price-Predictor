"Lizzo and Lil Nas X are among the leading nominees for this year's awards The 62nd annual Grammy Awards take place in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Billed as ""music's biggest night"", the ceremony is more like ""music's longest day"" - with festivities kicking off at lunchtime in LA and stretching out into the night. Comfortable shoes are advised. Pop star Lizzo leads the nominations this year, with eight in total, including album and song of the year. Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X are close behind with six each. All three represent a new vanguard of pop - charismatic and non-conformist, with songs that defined the last 12 months (Lizzo's Truth Hurts, Billie's Bad Guy and Lil Nas X's Old Town Road). But, as Snoop Dogg knows only too well, nominations don't necessarily translate into trophies. The rapper has gone home empty-handed 17 times - a victim of the Grammys' tendency to reward establishment heavyweights over vibrant new talent. We'll avoid predicting the winners for that very reason... But here are seven other moments to watch out for. Ousted Grammy Awards boss makes corruption claims Grammys 2020: Snubs and surprises Grammy Awards 2020: List of nominees Allow YouTube content?

Who'd have thought that a cowboy rap song recorded by a gay teenager for just $50 would become the longest-running number one in US chart history? Well, that's the story of Old Town Road, Lil Nas X's likeably daft breakout track, which racked up19 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts last year. The single's sustained success was partly due to a constant stream of remixes that refreshed the song and introduced it to new audiences. To celebrate his six Grammy nominations, Lil Nas X is bringing out everyone who collaborated on a remix - including Billy Ray Cyrus, Diplo, BTS and 13-year-old country singer Mason Ramsey - for an all-star performance. Hopefully, their live version will be released as a single, which will in turn be eligible for next year's Grammys, and the cycle will continue until the sun dies and the universe ends. It's what we deserve. Ten days before the Grammys, the Recording Academy dropped a bombshell: It was suspending its chief executive Deborah Dugan with immediate effect. Dugan responded by filing a discrimination complaint in which she suggested the voting process for the Grammys was compromised. Some of her claims merely confirmed what everyone always suspected - that people who perform on the night are given preferential treatment. But Dugan also alleges that artists and their representatives are allowed to sit on the ""secret committees"" who decide the shortlists, and insert themselves into the running. She said these ""conflicts of interest"" had""tainted"" the awards, a claim which the Recording Academy called ""spurious"" and ""categorically false"". But will anyone be bold enough to acknowledge the claims - or refuse to accept a trophy - at the ceremony? Lana Del Rey is deservedly a contender for album of the year - but her record's sweary title will cause a headache for the organisers. How will they refer to it on television? And what goes on the trophy if she wins? Lana's solution for the supermarket edition of the record was to reduce the title to an acronym: NFR. But we prefer the Cockney version: ""Norman Flaming Rockwell"". While she's considered an underdog next to Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande's Thank U, Next, it's worth noting that NFR was a critical darling that topped the BBC's ""poll of polls"" for album of the year. The best albums and songs of 2019 revealed That's not as daft as it sounds: One of the leading contenders for best new artist, Lizzo, is actually on her third album - the twist being that the first two weren't hits. But it's hard to begrudge her nomination when she's celebrated her breakthrough with such an irrepressible joie de vivre, busting out flute solos,preaching body-positivity,externaland bringing a giant pair of inflatable buttocks to the MTV Awards (see above). Her main competition comes from spook-pop sorceress Billie Eilish, whose album When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go was America's biggest-selling debut of 2019, selling 2.5 million copies. Both singers are nominated in all four of the Grammy's biggest categories -  record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist - with Eilish being the youngest-ever artist to achieve that feat. Rock titans Aerosmith will receive the MusiCares Person Of The Year award, which recognises both musical and philanthropic endeavours (the band have a charity supporting abused women, a topic they first addressed in the song Janie's Got A Gun). They'll also get to play a medley of their hits - with Run-DMC joining them to recreate the 1986 rap-rock crossover Walk This Way. It'll be the first time the two bands have played together since 2007, in London's Hyde Park. One person who won't be joining the celebration, however, is Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer, who's been told he can't play with the band after recovering from a foot injury. He even took the issue to court, butlost the case on Wednesday,external. Believe it or not, Harry Potter already has two Grammys - both in the best audiobook category - and JK Rowling's boy wizard could double that tally this year. Imogen Heap's gorgeous score for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is nominated for best musical theatre album category; while  a new recording of Hedwig's Theme, which appeared in all eight Potter films, is up for best instrumental arrangement. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama is nominated in the spoken word category for the audiobook of her memoir, Becoming. Her husband Barack has already won the category twice, but a third trophy would really bring the room together. Rapper Nipsey Hussle's life was cut tragically short last year, when he was shot outside a clothing store he owned in Los Angeles. The 33-year-old was more than a musician, though. He was a community activist, who was deeply committed to rebuilding and regenerating the neighbourhood he grew up in. After his death, the Los Angeles Police Department hailed him as a ""peacemaker"". He never won a Grammy in his lifetime, but organisers will acknowledge his legacy with a star-studded tribute featuring DJ Khaled, John Legend, Meek Mill, and gospel singer Kirk Franklin. This video can not be played 33-year-old Nipsey Hussle was shot dead outside his clothing store in Los Angeles The night's other big tribute is more of a curveball. Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper, Lang Lang, Ben Platt and John Legend (yes, him again) are lined up to performThe Body Electric,external, a song you may vaguely remember from the finale to the 1980 movie Fame, which centred on a group of students at the New York City High School for the Performing Arts. The segment is apparently a self-congratulatory honour for TV producer Ken Ehrlich, who's been putting together the Grammy ceremony for the last 40 years. Other, presumably more-compelling, performances on the night will come from Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, the Jonas Brothers, Lizzo and Spanish star RosalÃ­a. Pop star Demi Lovato will also make her comeback after completing treatment for substance abuse in 2018 following a suspected overdose. Alicia Keys will host the ceremony for the second time Because the Grammys features approximately 2,735 categories, there are actually two ceremonies. The first one, officially called the Grammy Awards Premiere, can bestreamed live on Grammy.com,externalfrom 20:30 (UK) / 15:30 (ET) on Sunday 26 January. Hosted by British musician Imogen Heap, it will feature performances by Nicola Benedetti, Yola and AngÃ©lique Kidjo; while prizes like best immersive audio album and best regional Mexican music album (Including Tejano) will be handed out. Sadly, the main ceremony isn't broadcast live in the UK - but US viewers can catch it live on CBS from 20:00 (ET). Highlights will be shown on 4Music from 19:30 on Monday, 27 January.

"A-list celebrities lined the court to pay homage as Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Flea played the national anthem. Some in the 18,000 sell-out crowd had paid upwards of $25,000 (Â£17,580) to be there. Kobe Bryant's 1,566th and final game for the LA Lakers, bringing to an end a career spanning two decades, was a big deal. Here are the numbers which tell you why: Bryant was voted Most Valuable Player in 2008 The number of Most Valuable Player awards Bryant has won. The accolade given the best-performing player in a regular season, Bryant won it in 2007-08. The number of NBA Finals MVP awards won by Bryant, in 2008-09 and the following year. It is also the number of Olympic gold medals he has won, helping the United States to the top of the podium in 2008 and 2012. All-Star MVP Awards won - in 2001-02, 2006-07, 2008-09 and 2010-11. He is tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. Bryant (centre) got emotional at the 2000 NBA championship presentation Bryant has won five NBA championships - only one other current player has won as many (Tim Duncan of San Antonio Spurs). Just four players in NBA history - Bryant, Michael Jordan, Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton  - have been selected for the NBA All-defensive first team nine times. And only one other player, Karl Malone, has ever made the All-NBA First Team selections 11 times. Bryant's appearance in the 2016 All-Star game was his 18th in a row That is how many starts Bryant has made in the NBA's annual All-Star Game - the most in NBA history. And 16 is the number of times Bryant has played on Christmas day - again, the most in NBA history. As well as making 15 starts, Bryant has been picked for the All-Star Game 18 times in a row. That is the longest streak in NBA history and only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with 19, made the All-Star Game more times. Bryant was 13th pick in the 1996 draft for Charlotte Hornets - who then traded him to LA Lakers No other player in NBA history has spent 20 seasons with just one club. Bryant is a Lakers man through and through. The number of games in which he has scored 50 points - only Wilt Chamberlain (118) and Michael Jordan (31) have scored 50-plus points more times. The number of points scored against Utah Jazz in his final game. It was only the seventh time he had scored 60-plus points and the first time he had achieved the feat since 2009. When the Lakers beat Toronto Raptors 122-104 on 22 January 2006, Bryant scored 81 of his side's points. Only Wilt Chamberlain, with a 100-point game in 1962, has scored more. Bryant's 5,640 points scored in the NBA playoffs is the third highest total in NBA history behind Jordan (5,987) and Abdul-Jabbar (5,762). Only two other players in NBA history have scored more points than Bryant Since his rookie season in 1996-97, Bryant has scored 33,643 regular season points, putting him third on the all-time scoring list behind Abdul-Jabbar (38,387) and Karl Malone (36,928). Only five other players have played more NBA minutes than Bryant. He was given 42 minutes in his final game - the most he has played since November 2014.

"The UK leaves the EU on Friday The government is aiming to secure a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" free trade deal with the EU, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the UK would not diverge from current EU trade regulations ""for the sake of it"". Mr Barclay added the government's objectives for the trade talks would be published after Brexit on 31 January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a speech next month setting out more details, he said. Mr Barclay's comments come after theUS treasury secretary said his country wants to agree to a post-Brexit trade dealwith the UK this year. After Brexit happens at 23:00 GMT on Friday, the UK will be free to negotiate and sign new trade deals with countries with no existing EU deals - like the US. The UK then enters into an agreed transition period with the EU, which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time the UK will aim to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU to ensure that UK goods are not subject to tariffs and other trade barriers. John Pienaar: Brexit sound bites and slogans will run out Commemorative Brexit 50p coin unveiled What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Barclay said: ""We are going to publish our objectives for the negotiation and we will set that out in due course after the 31st. ""The key issue is that we will have control of our rules, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not diverge for the sake of diverging. ""We start from a position of alignment but the key opportunity is that we will be able to set our standards, high standards, on worker's rights, on the environment, on state aid as part of that trade policy."" He said ""both sides are committed"" to securing a trade deal by the end of December, adding: ""It's in both side's interests to keep the flow of goods going."" Irish minister for European affairs, Helen McEntee, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that ""Brexit is really only at half-time, we have a huge amount of work still to do"". ""However, the idea that we can negotiate a trade deal with one that is comprehensive, one that provides very little change for our citizens, not just in the UK and Ireland, but the EU as well, within about a 12-month space, it's very difficult."" The new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyenhas previously shared concerns about the timeframe, saying it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. Priti Patel said that the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit Meanwhile, the home secretary told Sophy Ridge UK businesses have been ""too reliant on low-skilled cheap labour from the EU"". Priti Patel said the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit. She also confirmed that the Migration Advisory Committee will report this week on the UK's future immigration system. The government was ""absolutely determined to change the immigration system, end the complexity of the immigration system, have simpler rules, have a points-based system where we can absolutely have people that bring the right kind of skills for our labour market"", she said. On the UK's post-Brexit relationship with EU rules, Ms Patel appeared to adopt a harder approach than Mr Barclay, saying: ""In terms of divergence, we are not having alignment. We will be diverging. We want to take control of our laws, money and our borders."" Last week, Chancellor Sajid Javid said the UK would use the power to diverge from EU rules on tradeonly when it was in the interests of business.

"The UK leaves the EU on Friday The government is aiming to secure a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" free trade deal with the EU, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the UK would not diverge from current EU trade regulations ""for the sake of it"". Mr Barclay added the government's objectives for the trade talks would be published after Brexit on 31 January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a speech next month setting out more details, he said. Mr Barclay's comments come after theUS treasury secretary said his country wants to agree to a post-Brexit trade dealwith the UK this year. After Brexit happens at 23:00 GMT on Friday, the UK will be free to negotiate and sign new trade deals with countries with no existing EU deals - like the US. The UK then enters into an agreed transition period with the EU, which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time the UK will aim to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU to ensure that UK goods are not subject to tariffs and other trade barriers. John Pienaar: Brexit sound bites and slogans will run out Commemorative Brexit 50p coin unveiled What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Barclay said: ""We are going to publish our objectives for the negotiation and we will set that out in due course after the 31st. ""The key issue is that we will have control of our rules, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not diverge for the sake of diverging. ""We start from a position of alignment but the key opportunity is that we will be able to set our standards, high standards, on worker's rights, on the environment, on state aid as part of that trade policy."" He said ""both sides are committed"" to securing a trade deal by the end of December, adding: ""It's in both side's interests to keep the flow of goods going."" Irish minister for European affairs, Helen McEntee, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that ""Brexit is really only at half-time, we have a huge amount of work still to do"". ""However, the idea that we can negotiate a trade deal with one that is comprehensive, one that provides very little change for our citizens, not just in the UK and Ireland, but the EU as well, within about a 12-month space, it's very difficult."" The new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyenhas previously shared concerns about the timeframe, saying it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. Priti Patel said that the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit Meanwhile, the home secretary told Sophy Ridge UK businesses have been ""too reliant on low-skilled cheap labour from the EU"". Priti Patel said the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit. She also confirmed that the Migration Advisory Committee will report this week on the UK's future immigration system. The government was ""absolutely determined to change the immigration system, end the complexity of the immigration system, have simpler rules, have a points-based system where we can absolutely have people that bring the right kind of skills for our labour market"", she said. On the UK's post-Brexit relationship with EU rules, Ms Patel appeared to adopt a harder approach than Mr Barclay, saying: ""In terms of divergence, we are not having alignment. We will be diverging. We want to take control of our laws, money and our borders."" Last week, Chancellor Sajid Javid said the UK would use the power to diverge from EU rules on tradeonly when it was in the interests of business.

"""Buy now, pay later"" allows customers to delay payment or split it into smaller instalments At the end of your online shop, you may have noticed a new way to pay. It's not a bank card, it's not store credit. And it's quick; just a couple of clicks. So-called ""buy now, pay later"" services allow customers to either delay the whole bill for their chosen item, or split the cost into a clutch of equal instalments, interest-free. Despite growing calls from debt charities about these products adding pressure to Britain's multi-billion pound debt pile, UK financial regulators have no plans to investigate them. The firms are familiar to Dan Lane and his team at Christians Against Poverty, and the charity is keeping a close eye on how they factor into those they help. ""We are confident that the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will also be keeping a close eye on these new firms, these new products and seeing how it impacts the people that will be using them. We would expect them to take action as necessary where and when they are able to if it is needed,"" he says. Rebecca McGrath: ""It's so easy to get carried away"" The persuasive power of the products is not lost on a group of graduates from Salford University. ""It makes you feel like you're getting an even better deal,"" says Ellie Kemp. ""If you're sensible and responsible, then why not?"" adds Rebecca McGrath. But as they click through a couple of pretend purchases, both the ease of use and the way information presented start to put the group off: ""That's where the dangers can come in,"" says Rebecca. ""If you have multiple orders, it's so easy to get carried away. And what is not outlined is what happens if you miss these payments."" KlarnaSweden, launched in UK in 2014 Six million UK customers, adding 55,000 extra a week 190,000+ retailers in 17 countries, including ASOS, H&M, TopShop, Michael Kors, Samsung Pay 30 days later or split cost of item into three equal instalments Unpaid debts from Buy Now, Pay Later products are currently not referred to debt collectors LaybuyNew Zealand, launched in UK in 2019 Would not give UK customer numbers 800+ retailers, including JD Sports, Footasylum, WH Smith, AX Paris Pay in six instalments, interest-free, Â£6 late fee after 24 hours and again after seven days Customers referred to credit agency after 45 days ClearPayAustralia, launched in UK in 2019 500,000+ customers Retailers include M&S, Urban Outfitters, Pretty Little Thing Pay in four instalments within six weeks, Â£6 late fee after 24 hours and again after seven days Customers can be referred to credit agency at ClearPay's discretion The BBC contacted Klarna, ClearPay and Laybuy which all said 2019 had been their biggest year yet in the UK. And two of those three main players added 3.3 million new customers to their base - meaning these products have an estimated seven million users. The UK holds such potential that Gary Rohloff, the cofounder of Laybuy, has moved his family from New Zealand to London, and he expects the UK business to be bigger than in his home country within the next year. ""This is an interest-free credit option, so for a consumer this is a way of buying the things they need,"" explains Mr Rohloff. ""We've had families write to us thanking us for being able to afford raincoats at the start of winter because they couldn't afford to buy coats in one hit but can afford smaller payments over six weeks."" Gary Rohloff and his son Alex founded Laybuy Laybuy, like its competitors, is popular with young people who do not want to take out formal credit arrangements, but also slightly older parents in their 30s and 40s trying to spread costs. But Mr Rohloff does add that using ""buy now, pay later"" might encourage a consumer to spend more, saying: ""The average order values are significantly higher."" Which is why they are so popular with retailers. Like all such providers, Laybuy says it makes most of its money from the retailers themselves - about Â£4 in every Â£100 spent - and defends late fees as an ""incentive to pay"". Mr Rohloff maintains that there are sufficient warnings to avoid users getting into trouble. Laybuy is not registered with regulator, the FCA, but does work with Experian to run a hard credit check  on users (which can impact their credit score) to make sure they can afford to pay. ""We wouldn't want our sons put in an unsustainable debt position, so we would not allow the company to do that to others,"" he says. Regulation is not on the cards yet.The FCA has been looking at consumer credit,externalbut because these products do not charge interest, they fall out of their remit for regulation. Dan Lane: ""If you can't afford the product today - why do you think you could afford it in 30,60 or 90 days time?"" However its counterpart in Australia - where these products have been around much longer -undertook a recent review that found numerous causes for concern,external. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission highlighted potential risks to the market's under-35 customer base, adding that these arrangements can cause consumers to ""become financially over-committed"" and therefore likely to face late fees. ASIC wants its remit extended to cover ""buy now, pay later"". Here in the UK the FCA has no plans but will continue to monitor the market. There's no denying these companies are providing some help in a retail slump. But Mr Lane from Christians Against Poverty has one last question for shoppers: ""Overall, we would say to people that if you can't afford the product today - why do you think you could afford it in 30, 60 or 90 days time?""

"The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei province, and has infected 2,000 people since its discovery. An airlift for Britons stuck in China's Hubei province by the coronavirus outbreak is being kept ""under review"", the government has said. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told Andrew Marr it was a ""fast-moving situation"" and the Foreign Office was working with Chinese authorities. Updated Foreign Office guidance,externalhas warned against all travel to Hubei province - where the virus began - and urged Britons to leave if they can. The virus has so far killed 56 people. A total of 52 tests have come back negative for the new strain in the UK, the Department of Health said on Sunday - indicating that the results of 21 tests have been concluded since its last update on Saturday. Virus 'spreads before symptoms show' UK tests come back negative Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Can wearing masks help stop the spread? Hubei province has been on lockdown for days as the authorities try to contain the virus which originated in the city of Wuhan and has infected almost 2,000 people since its discovery. Some British people in Hubei province say they are stuck and are unhappy with the government response. Tony, from the UK, told BBC News he was en route to Wuhan when travel restrictions were first published by the British government. He is now in the city with his Chinese wife and her family. He said: ""The feeling of many here is that the government are sacrificing the Wuhan people for the greater good of the country. ""The transport situation has made it difficult for people to go to those jobs that should still be done."" Tony said he tried to contact the British Consulate in Wuhan and the UK embassy in Beijing ""but the answer phone message has not been updated"". Britons Sophie and Jason, young graduates in Wuhan to teach English, said they had ""been stuck in the house for four days"". This video can not be played Britons in Wuhan: 'It's manic, everyone is trying to stockpile food' ""We're frustrated by the fact we don't know what's going on,"" Sophie said. ""It's scary."" Yvonne Griffiths, a university lecturer from Cardiff,was due to fly home on Monday, but her family have told BBC Wales the journey has been cancelled. She said: ""I am disappointed at the absolute silence on the issue of how stranded people are going to get home."" Dr Yvonne Griffiths is in a hotel room in Wuhan Dr Griffths' daughter Bethan Webber said a government airlift would now be her mother's only option. ""Short of the government getting her out there's no getting out,"" she said. Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned the spread of the virus is accelerating, telling senior officials the country is facing a ""grave situation"". Checkpoints in Hubei province are preventing people from leaving, the airport has been closed, and many of the roads are blocked to all vehicles except those carrying patients or medical supplies. China's health minister Ma Xiaowei told reporters the ability of the virus to spread appeared to be strengthening. British scientists have said that it may not be possible for China to contain the virus. Researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Diseases have calculated that each person is passing the virus on to two or three others. The scientists, based at Imperial College, London, say the transmission rate needs to be cut by 60% in order to get on top of the outbreak. In the UK, tests on 31 people suspected of contracting the virus have come back negative, the government said on Saturday. In its most recent update, the Department of Health said there are currently ""no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low"". Officials are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan in the past fortnight. More people have been spotted wearing masks in London in recent days where many are celebrating the Lunar New Year. On Saturday, Australia confirmed its first four cases - first in Melbourne, and then three more in Sydney. It has also spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France. China has flown specialist military medical teams into Hubei province and state newspaper the People's Daily reported that a second emergency hospital was under construction, as the virus continues to spread. Across mainland China, travellers are having their temperatures checked for signs of fever, and train stations have been shut in several cities. Many Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled. From Monday, China is suspending all foreign trips by Chinese holiday tour groups, state media reported. A nationwide ban on wildlife trade has been welcomed by animal protection groups. Kate Nustedt of World Animal Protection said she the move would ""put a stop to the horrific conditions that serve as such a lethal hotbed of disease"".

"The 252-foot-long passenger jet aeroplane has been delayed by some technical difficulties Boeing has successfully completed the first test flight of the world's largest twin-engined plane, the 777X. It comes as the firm attempts to boost its image after its 737 Max plane was grounded last year following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The flight took off near Seattle and lasted four hours. Two attempts were called off this week due to high winds. Further tests are needed before the aircraft enters service with Emirates next year. Victims' families slam report into 737 Max crashes The 252-foot-long passenger plane had been due to launch this year but has been delayed by some technical difficulties. The 777X is a larger and more efficient version of Boeing's successful 777 mini-jumbo. Standout features include folding wingtips and the world's largest commercial engines. ""It represents the great things we can do as a company,"" said 777X marketing director Wendy Sowers. Boeing says it has sold 309 of the plane - worth more than $442 million each at list prices. The plane will go head-to-head with the Airbus A350-1000 which seats about 360 passengers. Further tests are needed before the aircraft enters service with Emirates next year Boeing has been in crisis since the 737 Max crashes, which occurred within five months of each other - first in Indonesia in October 2018 and then in Ethiopia last March. It is facing multiple investigations amid accusations that it sacrificed safety as it rushed to get its jets to customers. It is attempting to have the plane re-approved for flight. The grounding of the 737 Max, which had been Boeing's best-selling plane, is estimated to have already cost Boeing more than $9bn.

"Jordan Sinnott started his career at Huddersfield Town A non-league footballer has died after being attacked during a night out, police have said. Jordan Sinnott, who played for Matlock Town, was found unconscious in Market Place, Retford, Nottinghamshire, at about 02:00 GMT on Friday. Police have launched a murder investigation after the 25-year-old midfielder was found following ""two large-scale disturbances"" in the town. He suffered a fractured skull and died in hospital. A man has been arrested. The 27-year-old remains in police custody and was earlier being questioned on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Det Insp Justine Wilson said: ""Mr Sinnott's death is a sad and significant development in this investigation. ""Our investigative team's focus will remain on identifying those responsible and bringing them to justice."" On Saturday, Matlock Town, who play in the Northern Premier League, said players found out about Sinnott's condition when they arrived for their match versus Mickleover Sports and ""agreed it should be postponed to a future date"". The club issued a statement after Mr Sinnott died, which said: ""His family and friends were with him at his bedside and we send our sincere condolences to them all at this very sad time."" They tweeted,external: ""You weren't just a footballer, you were our friend and brother. You gave us incredible memories and scored your first career hat-trick in your final game for the club. Rest easy Jordan, we love, miss and will never forget you."" Sinnott had joined Matlock from National League North side Alfreton Town, who also issued a statement in which they described the player as a ""model footballer and an exceptional talent"".

"The 252-foot-long passenger jet aeroplane has been delayed by some technical difficulties Boeing has successfully completed the first test flight of the world's largest twin-engined plane, the 777X. It comes as the firm attempts to boost its image after its 737 Max plane was grounded last year following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The flight took off near Seattle and lasted four hours. Two attempts were called off this week due to high winds. Further tests are needed before the aircraft enters service with Emirates next year. Victims' families slam report into 737 Max crashes The 252-foot-long passenger plane had been due to launch this year but has been delayed by some technical difficulties. The 777X is a larger and more efficient version of Boeing's successful 777 mini-jumbo. Standout features include folding wingtips and the world's largest commercial engines. ""It represents the great things we can do as a company,"" said 777X marketing director Wendy Sowers. Boeing says it has sold 309 of the plane - worth more than $442 million each at list prices. The plane will go head-to-head with the Airbus A350-1000 which seats about 360 passengers. Further tests are needed before the aircraft enters service with Emirates next year Boeing has been in crisis since the 737 Max crashes, which occurred within five months of each other - first in Indonesia in October 2018 and then in Ethiopia last March. It is facing multiple investigations amid accusations that it sacrificed safety as it rushed to get its jets to customers. It is attempting to have the plane re-approved for flight. The grounding of the 737 Max, which had been Boeing's best-selling plane, is estimated to have already cost Boeing more than $9bn.

"The UK's fixed-term parliaments could see politicians failing to prioritise climate change, veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has suggested. He told the first citizens' assembly on climate having a five-year government leads to a lack of long-term planning. The 110-strong assembly in Birmingham will meet over four weekends to examine options for how the UK can meet its greenhouse gas emission targets. Sir David said he was ""extremely grateful"" to those taking part. It is hoped their recommendations - to be published in April - will help inform Parliament and the government on policies to reach net zero emissions. Sir David said one of the problems with Parliament having a fixed length of five years is that the effects of climate change may only be felt much later. ""It is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry about an issue which is not going to come to a climax - and people won't know if it is successful or not successful - for 10 years hence, 15 years hence,"" he said. Citizens' assembly aims to tackle climate change 'We've been putting things off for year after year' Attenborough backs Â£1m nature reserve appeal Sir David Attenborough to make climate change plea He told the group: ""So the fact you are here is extremely important because it shows you can put pressure on your members of Parliament to take this issue seriously."" ""I believe that the question we are facing is of the utmost importance,"" he added. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 requires an election be held every five years, unless two-thirds of MPs vote for an early poll. The citizens' assembly, commissioned by six parliamentary select committees, is being asked to examine how the UK meets its legal target to cut greenhouse gases to zero overall by 2050. The 110 members of the assembly will learn from experts about climate change, and discuss and make informed decisions on options for meeting the net zero goal during sessions in Birmingham. Their differences are crucial - they've been chosen to reflect the nation in diversity of age, ethnicity, geography and opinion. Among them are people who are unworried by climate change - as well as others who are positively alarmed. You might have thought a climate conference like this would be a meat-free zone, given the impact of cows on the planet. But this aims to be an extraordinary gathering of ""ordinary"" people. That means chicken and sweet potatoes on the lunch menu, as well as the beef - and a vegan option. And no preaching. Chris, an engineer from Oxford, says he's not yet convinced climate change is an emergency - he says he wants more facts. Leia from Darlington, who just lost her job as an engineering apprentice, doesn't need convincing - she doesn't want to be left with a badly-damaged planet. They have been drawn from more than 1,800 people who responded to 30,000 invitations sent out to UK households selected at random and are representative of the UK population in age, gender, ethnicity, education and where they live. Members are also representative of the country in terms of how concerned they are about climate change. Three of the group said they were not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said. Business, trade union, faith, farming and environmental leaders have given their backing to the citizens' assembly. The Â£520,000 scheme has been funded through Â£120,000 from Parliament's select committees' research budgets and two philanthropic foundations.

"""Buy now, pay later"" allows customers to delay payment or split it into smaller instalments At the end of your online shop, you may have noticed a new way to pay. It's not a bank card, it's not store credit. And it's quick; just a couple of clicks. So-called ""buy now, pay later"" services allow customers to either delay the whole bill for their chosen item, or split the cost into a clutch of equal instalments, interest-free. Despite growing calls from debt charities about these products adding pressure to Britain's multi-billion pound debt pile, UK financial regulators have no plans to investigate them. The firms are familiar to Dan Lane and his team at Christians Against Poverty, and the charity is keeping a close eye on how they factor into those they help. ""We are confident that the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will also be keeping a close eye on these new firms, these new products and seeing how it impacts the people that will be using them. We would expect them to take action as necessary where and when they are able to if it is needed,"" he says. Rebecca McGrath: ""It's so easy to get carried away"" The persuasive power of the products is not lost on a group of graduates from Salford University. ""It makes you feel like you're getting an even better deal,"" says Ellie Kemp. ""If you're sensible and responsible, then why not?"" adds Rebecca McGrath. But as they click through a couple of pretend purchases, both the ease of use and the way information presented start to put the group off: ""That's where the dangers can come in,"" says Rebecca. ""If you have multiple orders, it's so easy to get carried away. And what is not outlined is what happens if you miss these payments."" KlarnaSweden, launched in UK in 2014 Six million UK customers, adding 55,000 extra a week 190,000+ retailers in 17 countries, including ASOS, H&M, TopShop, Michael Kors, Samsung Pay 30 days later or split cost of item into three equal instalments Unpaid debts from Buy Now, Pay Later products are currently not referred to debt collectors LaybuyNew Zealand, launched in UK in 2019 Would not give UK customer numbers 800+ retailers, including JD Sports, Footasylum, WH Smith, AX Paris Pay in six instalments, interest-free, Â£6 late fee after 24 hours and again after seven days Customers referred to credit agency after 45 days ClearPayAustralia, launched in UK in 2019 500,000+ customers Retailers include M&S, Urban Outfitters, Pretty Little Thing Pay in four instalments within six weeks, Â£6 late fee after 24 hours and again after seven days Customers can be referred to credit agency at ClearPay's discretion The BBC contacted Klarna, ClearPay and Laybuy which all said 2019 had been their biggest year yet in the UK. And two of those three main players added 3.3 million new customers to their base - meaning these products have an estimated seven million users. The UK holds such potential that Gary Rohloff, the cofounder of Laybuy, has moved his family from New Zealand to London, and he expects the UK business to be bigger than in his home country within the next year. ""This is an interest-free credit option, so for a consumer this is a way of buying the things they need,"" explains Mr Rohloff. ""We've had families write to us thanking us for being able to afford raincoats at the start of winter because they couldn't afford to buy coats in one hit but can afford smaller payments over six weeks."" Gary Rohloff and his son Alex founded Laybuy Laybuy, like its competitors, is popular with young people who do not want to take out formal credit arrangements, but also slightly older parents in their 30s and 40s trying to spread costs. But Mr Rohloff does add that using ""buy now, pay later"" might encourage a consumer to spend more, saying: ""The average order values are significantly higher."" Which is why they are so popular with retailers. Like all such providers, Laybuy says it makes most of its money from the retailers themselves - about Â£4 in every Â£100 spent - and defends late fees as an ""incentive to pay"". Mr Rohloff maintains that there are sufficient warnings to avoid users getting into trouble. Laybuy is not registered with regulator, the FCA, but does work with Experian to run a hard credit check  on users (which can impact their credit score) to make sure they can afford to pay. ""We wouldn't want our sons put in an unsustainable debt position, so we would not allow the company to do that to others,"" he says. Regulation is not on the cards yet.The FCA has been looking at consumer credit,externalbut because these products do not charge interest, they fall out of their remit for regulation. Dan Lane: ""If you can't afford the product today - why do you think you could afford it in 30,60 or 90 days time?"" However its counterpart in Australia - where these products have been around much longer -undertook a recent review that found numerous causes for concern,external. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission highlighted potential risks to the market's under-35 customer base, adding that these arrangements can cause consumers to ""become financially over-committed"" and therefore likely to face late fees. ASIC wants its remit extended to cover ""buy now, pay later"". Here in the UK the FCA has no plans but will continue to monitor the market. There's no denying these companies are providing some help in a retail slump. But Mr Lane from Christians Against Poverty has one last question for shoppers: ""Overall, we would say to people that if you can't afford the product today - why do you think you could afford it in 30, 60 or 90 days time?""

"Jessie Buchanan is campaigning to buy a Pembrokeshire farm for the local community Young farmers are losing one of their few routes into the industry, Plaid Cymru has warned. Land held by local authorities has reduced by 10% in eight years, analysis of Welsh Government figures shows. For more than a century, councils have rented agricultural land to new and young farmers, which provides a ""step on the ladder"". Councils said they face ""acute financial pressures"" and the low-price sales are only a ""last resort"". Plaid Cymru assembly member Llyr Gruffydd said rural communities would be left with a ""gaping hole"" if sales continue at the same rate. ""This is one of the very few routes that young people and new farmers have into the industry,"" he said. Farm losses 'horrendous' due to bovine TB Farming fear over plans to plant 20 million trees Game of Thrones star joins community farm fight Council farms are agricultural units owned by local authorities which are rented out to farmers. They have been a way for young people to enter the farming industry since 1908 to address a decline in the number of farms. The farms are supported by law, for example the Agriculture Act states local authorities should ""make it their general aim to provide opportunities for persons to be farmers on their own account by letting holdings"". Official figures say there are now just 963 local authority farms - 430 with houses or buildings - in Wales. Councils say they recognise the benefits of their farms and are trying to ""hold the line"" Denbighshire, Flintshire, Anglesey, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Powys and Wrexham sold 184 hectares between them in 2016-17, which raised Â£4.2m. Trecadwgan Farm, near Solva, was put up for public auction last year by Pembrokeshire council and since then locals have raised tens of thousands of pounds to bid for it and make it a community farm. Campaign group chair Jessie Buchanan wants to avoid ""ending the life of a farm that has been there for 800 years"". ""The vision for Trecadwgan farm that we have put forward is something that will create employment and offer scope for wellbeing within the community,"" she said. Phil Dancer says he has been lucky to be able to stay in the area Phil Dancer, 32, is a first generation sheep famer who recently secured a 12-year tenancy on a council farm outside Machynlleth, Powys. ""When we came for the viewing day [at my farm], there must have been 20 [to] 30 applicants walking about the place,"" he said. ""I consider myself very lucky to have had it and to be able to stay in the area, which means a lot to me. ""It's a big difference for me now. I have the security of 12 years. I can invest a bit into the ground, which will in turn improve my livestock. ""At the end of the day it's a step on the ladder and my plan is to move up the ladder. It will make the next step easier hopefully."" A Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) spokesperson said: ""Inevitably in the face of acute financial pressures, councils have had to consider selling off some of their farms and some have indeed done so. ""However, this is a last resort and local authorities are trying to hold the line, recognising their long term benefits. "" The WLGA said a rural forum, made up of nine local authorities, is working to develop a 'rural deal' to ""complement the more urban focussed city and growth deals"".

"The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei province, and has infected 2,000 people since its discovery. An airlift for Britons stuck in China's Hubei province by the coronavirus outbreak is being kept ""under review"", the government has said. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told Andrew Marr it was a ""fast-moving situation"" and the Foreign Office was working with Chinese authorities. Updated Foreign Office guidance,externalhas warned against all travel to Hubei province - where the virus began - and urged Britons to leave if they can. The virus has so far killed 56 people. A total of 52 tests have come back negative for the new strain in the UK, the Department of Health said on Sunday - indicating that the results of 21 tests have been concluded since its last update on Saturday. Virus 'spreads before symptoms show' UK tests come back negative Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Can wearing masks help stop the spread? Hubei province has been on lockdown for days as the authorities try to contain the virus which originated in the city of Wuhan and has infected almost 2,000 people since its discovery. Some British people in Hubei province say they are stuck and are unhappy with the government response. Tony, from the UK, told BBC News he was en route to Wuhan when travel restrictions were first published by the British government. He is now in the city with his Chinese wife and her family. He said: ""The feeling of many here is that the government are sacrificing the Wuhan people for the greater good of the country. ""The transport situation has made it difficult for people to go to those jobs that should still be done."" Tony said he tried to contact the British Consulate in Wuhan and the UK embassy in Beijing ""but the answer phone message has not been updated"". Britons Sophie and Jason, young graduates in Wuhan to teach English, said they had ""been stuck in the house for four days"". This video can not be played Britons in Wuhan: 'It's manic, everyone is trying to stockpile food' ""We're frustrated by the fact we don't know what's going on,"" Sophie said. ""It's scary."" Yvonne Griffiths, a university lecturer from Cardiff,was due to fly home on Monday, but her family have told BBC Wales the journey has been cancelled. She said: ""I am disappointed at the absolute silence on the issue of how stranded people are going to get home."" Dr Yvonne Griffiths is in a hotel room in Wuhan Dr Griffths' daughter Bethan Webber said a government airlift would now be her mother's only option. ""Short of the government getting her out there's no getting out,"" she said. Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned the spread of the virus is accelerating, telling senior officials the country is facing a ""grave situation"". Checkpoints in Hubei province are preventing people from leaving, the airport has been closed, and many of the roads are blocked to all vehicles except those carrying patients or medical supplies. China's health minister Ma Xiaowei told reporters the ability of the virus to spread appeared to be strengthening. British scientists have said that it may not be possible for China to contain the virus. Researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Diseases have calculated that each person is passing the virus on to two or three others. The scientists, based at Imperial College, London, say the transmission rate needs to be cut by 60% in order to get on top of the outbreak. In the UK, tests on 31 people suspected of contracting the virus have come back negative, the government said on Saturday. In its most recent update, the Department of Health said there are currently ""no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low"". Officials are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan in the past fortnight. More people have been spotted wearing masks in London in recent days where many are celebrating the Lunar New Year. On Saturday, Australia confirmed its first four cases - first in Melbourne, and then three more in Sydney. It has also spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France. China has flown specialist military medical teams into Hubei province and state newspaper the People's Daily reported that a second emergency hospital was under construction, as the virus continues to spread. Across mainland China, travellers are having their temperatures checked for signs of fever, and train stations have been shut in several cities. Many Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled. From Monday, China is suspending all foreign trips by Chinese holiday tour groups, state media reported. A nationwide ban on wildlife trade has been welcomed by animal protection groups. Kate Nustedt of World Animal Protection said she the move would ""put a stop to the horrific conditions that serve as such a lethal hotbed of disease"".

"The UK's fixed-term parliaments could see politicians failing to prioritise climate change, veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has suggested. He told the first citizens' assembly on climate having a five-year government leads to a lack of long-term planning. The 110-strong assembly in Birmingham will meet over four weekends to examine options for how the UK can meet its greenhouse gas emission targets. Sir David said he was ""extremely grateful"" to those taking part. It is hoped their recommendations - to be published in April - will help inform Parliament and the government on policies to reach net zero emissions. Sir David said one of the problems with Parliament having a fixed length of five years is that the effects of climate change may only be felt much later. ""It is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry about an issue which is not going to come to a climax - and people won't know if it is successful or not successful - for 10 years hence, 15 years hence,"" he said. Citizens' assembly aims to tackle climate change 'We've been putting things off for year after year' Attenborough backs Â£1m nature reserve appeal Sir David Attenborough to make climate change plea He told the group: ""So the fact you are here is extremely important because it shows you can put pressure on your members of Parliament to take this issue seriously."" ""I believe that the question we are facing is of the utmost importance,"" he added. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 requires an election be held every five years, unless two-thirds of MPs vote for an early poll. The citizens' assembly, commissioned by six parliamentary select committees, is being asked to examine how the UK meets its legal target to cut greenhouse gases to zero overall by 2050. The 110 members of the assembly will learn from experts about climate change, and discuss and make informed decisions on options for meeting the net zero goal during sessions in Birmingham. Their differences are crucial - they've been chosen to reflect the nation in diversity of age, ethnicity, geography and opinion. Among them are people who are unworried by climate change - as well as others who are positively alarmed. You might have thought a climate conference like this would be a meat-free zone, given the impact of cows on the planet. But this aims to be an extraordinary gathering of ""ordinary"" people. That means chicken and sweet potatoes on the lunch menu, as well as the beef - and a vegan option. And no preaching. Chris, an engineer from Oxford, says he's not yet convinced climate change is an emergency - he says he wants more facts. Leia from Darlington, who just lost her job as an engineering apprentice, doesn't need convincing - she doesn't want to be left with a badly-damaged planet. They have been drawn from more than 1,800 people who responded to 30,000 invitations sent out to UK households selected at random and are representative of the UK population in age, gender, ethnicity, education and where they live. Members are also representative of the country in terms of how concerned they are about climate change. Three of the group said they were not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said. Business, trade union, faith, farming and environmental leaders have given their backing to the citizens' assembly. The Â£520,000 scheme has been funded through Â£120,000 from Parliament's select committees' research budgets and two philanthropic foundations.
