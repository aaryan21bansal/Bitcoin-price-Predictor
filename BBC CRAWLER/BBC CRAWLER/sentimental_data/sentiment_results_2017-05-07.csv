"Sunday was the first time Joe Root has completed a 10-over spell in an ODI Second one-day international, Lord's England 328-6 (50 overs):Morgan 76, Root 73, Bairstow 72*, McCarthy 2-61 Ireland 243 all out (46.1 overs):Porterfield 82, Stirling 48, Plunkett 3-21, Root 3-52 England won by 85 runs Scorecard Joe Root starred as England sealed a series whitewash over Ireland in their two-match one-day international contest courtesy of an 85-run win at Lord's. Root scored 73 in a partnership of 140 with Eoin Morgan (76) before Jonny Bairstow's rapid 72 propelled England to 328-6 at the home of cricket. Paul Stirling struck 48 but Root's 3-52 swung the game the home side's way. Will Porterfield (82) gave Ireland a glimmer of hope but his dismissal spelt the end and they were all out for 241. Root's Yorkshire team-mate Liam Plunkett helped clean up the tail and ended up with figures of 3-21. However, it was a much-improved display from the tourists after Friday's seven-wicket defeat in Bristol in front of a healthy away following and one they can use as further proof of their suitability for Test status. England deservedly Champions Trophy favourites - Swann Relive England's victory over Ireland at Lord's Joe Root averages 48.81 in ODIs for England After Friday's first ODI,England captain Eoin Morgan spoke of the need for his players to find form before June's Champions Trophy on home soil, for which England are currently bookmakers' favourites. He has no worries over Root, who scored at a run a ball during his innings, the majority of which was spent in a partnership with his equally efficient skipper, and retains the ability to take timely wickets with his seemingly innocuous off-spin. Following the loss of Hales and Roy, who is England's biggest concern after adding an unconvincing 20 to his fifth-ball duck in Bristol, Root and Morgan took England past 200 before both fell in the space of three overs. A brief lull followed, during which England also lost Sam Billings, before Bairstow and Adil Rashid (39) restored the momentum and pushed the score past 300. Wicketkeeper-batsman Bairstow is a fixture in the Test side but has failed to nail down a regular spot in what is a congested England limited-overs middle order. However, with Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler both at the IPL, the 26-year-old was given an opportunity to excel that he did not waste. Demonstrating the clean-hitting that had seen him score a 113-ball 174 for Yorkshire in a recent One-Day Cup win over Durham, Bairstow took over from county colleague Root, acclimatised quickly and then accelerated to propel England beyond a 300 total that had previously looked in doubt. It took him 38 balls to reach his fourth ODI 50 before fully cutting loose, adding another 22 runs in just six deliveries that included three big sixes. With the three-game home series against South Africa to come later this month, before the start of the Champions Trophy, Bairstow is providing England with a nice selection dilemma to resolve. Tim Murtagh has played at Lord's for Middlesex since 2007 Ireland have had a bad couple of months, during which they have lost a one-day series and an ICC Intercontinental Cup fixture to chief rival associate nation Afghanistan, and both games in this series. In Bristol, they looked weighed down by what coach John Bracewell described as the ""huge pressure"" of the impending decision over their potential Test status, which should be made next month. However, they played with greater freedom and application on Sunday, rising to the challenge of their first encounter against England at Lord's. They were energetic in the field but unfortunately lack bowling depth beyond Tim Murtagh, who used his experience of Lord's from 10 years as a Middlesex player to keep England in check, especially in an initial spell of 1-16 off his opening six overs. Barry McCarthy (2-61) and Peter Chase (2-69) had their moments but lacked consistency and wilted under Bairstow's late onslaught. The lack of depth is mirrored in their batting. Stirling, Joyce and Porterfield are a talented top three but as England have shown over two games, there is little below them. Stirling and Joyce (16) added 68 for the opening wicket but both fell in the space of two and a half overs, the former to Jake Ball and the latter to Root, who would also claim the wickets of Niall O'Brien and Gary Wilson to help reduce Ireland to 154-5. Porterfield's clean striking carried the tourists past 200 until he was bowled by Mark Wood attempting a ramp shot, leaving the Durham seamer and Plunkett to clean up the tail. England's three-match ODI series with South Africa starts on 24 May England coach Trevor Bayliss, speaking to Sky Sports:""We know we have sterner tests coming up, against South Africa and in the Champions Trophy. We can do no more than play and win well. ""We will go into the three games against South Africa wanting to win that series. If we are 2-0 up with a game to go we will look at the team then."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""Bristol was a more convincing win and today presented us with different challenges. ""There was some cloud cover this morning and the openers got us off to a fantastic start. I shared in a good partnership with Joe Root and then Jonny Bairstow and Adil Rashid saw us home after a little wobble."" Ireland captain Will Porterfield:""I thought we were much improved today. ""We put a lot of things right - we bowled well and kept going when the big partnership got going and it took Jonny Bairstow to play well to get them to that big total. ""I think with the bat we were just a couple of wickets behind and that stopped us going for it at the end."" Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann on BBC Test Match Special:""It's been a very professional performance from England. They haven't taken their foot off the gas at any point in the series. 8.5/10 from England."" Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special:""I'm not sure England can take too much out of this series. It's good to see Bairstow play the way he does - but we know he's a quality player - and it's good to see Wood back. Perhaps I'd like to have seen more from him? But there's not much more we didn't already know."" England wrap up 85-run win over Ireland - reaction & video highlights India will play in Champions Trophy TMS: 60 years of great memories.

"Blackburn players fell to their knees at the final whistle against Brentford Blackburn were relegated to League One on goal difference, despite beating Brentford at Griffin Park, afterNottingham Forest's win over Ipswich. Rovers began in the final relegation place, level on points with Forest with an inferior goal difference. Charlie Mulgrew's free-kick and Danny Guthrie's strike put Rovers ahead, before Lasse Vibe flicked one back. Craig Conway's spot-kick made it 3-1, as Bees' Harlee Dean saw red but Forest andBirminghamwins sent Rovers down. Championship relegation battle as it happened Listen: 'The owners have ruined a fantastic club' Forest beat Ipswich to secure survival Redknapp's Blues beat Bristol City to seal safety 'It should never have come to this' With Birmingham only leading 1-0 against Bristol City at Ashton Gate, a goal for the Robins would have sent Blues down instead of Blackburn - but Harry Redknapp's side held on. Blackburn had lifted themselves out of the drop zone earlier in the day thanks to Mulgrew's superb free-kick into the top corner. Blackburn fans looked nervously at their phones hoping for better news elsewhere, but it never came Guthrie's scuffed effort, which Bees keeper Daniel Bentley should have kept out, doubled their lead, but Britt Assombalonga's goal to put Forest ahead at the City Ground dropped Rovers back into the bottom three. There was further anguish for Tony Mowbray's side when Vibe got in front of a defender at the near post to turn in Dean's delivery. Mowbray threw on attack-minded Lucas Joao, Marvin Emnes and Conway in a bid to improve their goal difference. Emnes was then fouled in the box by Dean, who was given his second yellow card, and Conway blasted home the penalty. But Rovers, with an inferior goal difference to Forest of just two goals, were relegated to the third tier for the first time in 37 years. Blackburn won four of their 16 matches under former Coventry City manager Mowbray It has been a season-long struggle for Blackburn, both on and off the pitch, having failed to rise above 20th in the table all season. Supporters have also protested against owners Venky's, who have seen the club slide from the Premier League to the third tier in their seven years at the helm. Some fans voiced their concern prior to the match that relegation this season could lead to potential administration. Away from the boardroom, the Lancashire side began the season with Owen Coyle at the helm, who could claim he was not backed in the transfer market, having spent Â£250,000 of the Â£10m he recouped in the transfer market. Coyle left in February after losing just under half his matches in charge and was replaced by Mowbray with the club three points off safety with 15 games to play. Mowbray had moved to Ewood Park five months after resigning as manager of League One side Coventry, a club that were also relegated this term and with controversial owners of their own. The new manager's change to a back three proved important in Rovers giving themselves a chance of survival, but it was too late for the 1994-95 Premier League winners. Blackburn striker Danny Graham holds his head in his hands after a missed chance against Brentford Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray: ""I am disappointed now but we have to try to keep the spirit we showed here and, if we do, the club will be very strong in League One next year. ""It's decided over 46 games and at the end of the season everyone at the club from the players to the medical team and the analysts have not been good enough to stay in this division. ""We have to take it on the chin. It's going to be a huge summer for us in terms of recruitment, and conversations with the owners are coming - we have to recruit well, be strong next year and bounce back. ""We need to keep our under-contract players. If we do, we will hopefully be too strong for a lot of clubs in League One. We just need to turn the ship around and get promotion."" Brentford boss Dean Smith: ""We wanted to finish the season on a high but there were a lot of tired legs out there - at the end they were putting their bodies on the line and that showed how much it mattered to do their best for the other clubs down there. ""It was what we were doing when we didn't have the ball that annoyed me in the first half. I gave them a rocket at half-time and we started the second half quite well but couldn't make our possession count. ""I feel for Tony. He has done a great job there and if he's allowed to keep the players he has, and the club keep him, then I'm sure they'll be knocking on the door to come back up next season.""

""The boys will go back and play matches for their county teams. By the time the Champions Trophy [on 1 June] comes around we should hopefully be firing on all cylinders."" England coach Trevor Bayliss with thoughts on the squad dilemmas ahead:Â ""From a selection point of view we think there is not a lot
between the three keepers we have. It will be hard to leave Jonny [Bairstow]
out with the runs he scores. He has shown again today the value he brings the

he is difficult to play. He has that X-factor.Â ""We are not sure [about his fitness] nor are the medical people at this stage. In the short term we will

After taking 1-24 in the first match at Bristol, Durham paceman Mark Wood consolidated his return from injury with some impressive pace in excess of 90mph and finished the match in style with an inswinging yorker as Ireland were all out for 243 in the 47th over, England winning by 85 runs. Ireland hit six sixes, one more than England. The O'Brien brothers hit three of those, here left-hander Niall dispatches one down the ground. Root is named man of the match and is asked if taking wickets gave him more pleasure than scoring runs:""Yes. Quite simply."" Root adds:""I feel in good order. It's been a slower start to theÂ seasonÂ than I would have liked but this has been a stepping stone into the Champions Trophy. We want to keep building momentum."" Root chipped in with a wicket in his first over and went on to claim two more with his off spin variations. He fell two short of a deserved half-century when he was given out caught behind after a review in the 14th over. Paul Stirling gave Ireland an electrifying start, bringing up the Ireland fifty in only the seventh over with a series of sweetly-struck strokes. Graeme SwannEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special Jonny Bairstow has really matured as a batsman. I love the follow-through he has - he's so solid and hits through the line.

"Aberdeen virtually uncatchable in second O'Connor wins it for Dons Goncalves nods in at back post Adam Rooney gives Dons the lead Dons' Jack ruled out with injury Win will all-but seal second spot for Dons FT: Partick Thistle 1-2 Rangers Late McKay & Garner goals for Rangers Andy Campbell and Bryn Palmer That's it for our live coverage this weekend. Â Thanks for your company. You can listen to commentary of the first leg of the Premiership play-off quarter-final between Morton and Dundee United on Tuesday, 19:45 kick-off. The Premiership resumes with Aberdeen hosting Celtic on Friday. Â Until then...    FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen He may have suffered a 10th defeat in his 19th Premiership match in charge, butHearts head coach Ian Cathroinsists nothing will shake his confidence. ""The fans are not happy, they are angry and upset and frustrated, because the team are not getting results. I am the person who is responsible for that,"" he tells Radio Scotland. ""I have absolute confidence in myself and in my work to find the things we need. Â We will deal with a bit of tension and anger, and we will build and grow. Â There will be different voices coming from that new stand. ""I don't need the confidence [of the owners and fans] because of the confidence I have in my work. There is not one thing that could happen that will rock my confidence in my work - that is impossible."" Â FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen Aberdeen manager Derek McInnesis understandably bullish after effectively clinching second place in the Premiership for a third straight season.Â He tells BBC Radio Scotland:""It was important we showed strength and resilience after Hearts scored, and composure and confidence to get the next goal, and we killed any momentum that Hearts had. ""There was total commitment, and a real honesty in the guys. We are punching totally above our weight to get to 70 points for a third year in a row. ""People thought with Rangers coming back up, we might struggle to match that but we have taken another giant step to finishing second and have got to two cup finals.Â ""My players have me everything today but we are still searching for those perfect performances that we will probably need to win the Scottish Cup final.""Â  FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen Former Hearts player Allan Preston on Radio Scotland:""That was absolute mediocrity from Hearts. They are dropping down the league like a hot brick and something has to change because the Hearts fans are getting short-changed. ""The club has gone backwards at a dramatic rate and the recruitment has been horrendous. ""Can Ian Cathro get it back? I don't think so. I think we are beyond the point of no return with Ian Cathro. This is a rip-up job and start again.""Â FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen This wasn't how it was supposed to end. Â Hearts players re-emerge from the dressing room wearing T-shirts thanking the fans for their support throughout the season. But although another near-capacity 16,522 were in attendance, barely 1,000 are left to acknowledge the players. Head coach Ian Cathro comes out after the players, takes a few tentative steps onto the pitch, gets booed, and thinks better of it.Â  FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen Willie MillerFormer Aberdeen defender on BBC Sportsound ""Aberdeen have been good throughout the season and they will finish second on merit. They have had some magnificent games, running up seven goals against both Motherwell and Dundee, and have looked invincible at the back at times, but not recently. ""They deserved the victory today. There was only one period where that was in doubt, at the start of the second half. I was really disappointed with the Hearts response to Aberdeen's second goal, and after that the Dons took control again.Â ""Throughout the season they have been the second best team. This wasn't one of their better performances, but it was full of grit and determination."" FT: Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen So that's a 10th defeat in 19 Premiership matches under Ian Cathro, and a fourth in 11 home league games. Â Fourth place, which would bring a Europa League spot, looks beyond them now, with three away games left - against Rangers, St Johnstone and Celtic. So that effectively wraps up the runners-up spot for Aberdeen for a third successive season, given their superior goal difference over Rangers. A dismal end to the season for the home fans, with boos ringing round Tynecastle. Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen Oh dear. Jamie Walker has not been at his best today, and his frustration shows as he slides into a tackle on Graeme Shinnie, and picks up his second yellow card of the match.  Hearts 1-2 Aberdeen Aberdeen's Mark Reynolds puts in a no-holds barred challenge on Hearts' Liam Smith, who tumbles spectacularly. Â It's a definite yellow. Â Other refs might have issued a red.

"Newcastle players celebrate winning the Championship title Newcastle United clinched the Championship title with victory over Barnsley, after Brighton conceded a late equaliser at Aston Villa. Ayoze Perez, Chancel Mbemba and Dwight Gayle scored in a comfortable victory, but it wasJack Grealish's 89th-minute goalwhich sealed the Magpies' title. Perez's flicked finish made it 1-0, before Mbemba smashed in to double the lead from a Perez rebound. Gayle added a late third before Grealish's goal handed them the title. It was a comfortable win for Rafael Benitez's side - yet it looked like it would not be enough to seal top spot, after Glenn Murray's penalty had put league leaders Brighton in front at Villa Park. However, despite being down to 10 men following Nathan Baker's red card, Grealish beat Brighton keeper David Stockdale to send the Magpies above Brighton in the table. How the final day of the Championship season unfolded Late Grealish equaliser denies Brighton title At St James' Park, DeAndre Yedlin terrorised Barnsley down the right-hand side and it was his cross which Perez guided into the bottom corner to open the scoring. Christian Atsu forced Barnsley goalkeeper Adam Davies into two strong diving saves with powerful shots and Massadio Haidara smashed a good chance over the crossbar from Perez's cut-back as the hosts dominated. Davies kept out Jack Colback with his legs, but the Magpies got a deserved second when Davies pushed Perez's shot out perfectly for Mbemba to smash home his first goal for the club. Jonjo Shelvey struck the post before Aleksandar Mitrovic's header sent substitute Gayle through to complete the scoring with a confident finish past the onrushing Davies. Newcastle players celebrate the title at the final whistle Under manager Benitez, Newcastle brought 12 players to the club after dropping into the Championship last summer, withMatt Ritchie and Gaylemoving down a division to sign five-year deals. More than Â£50 million was spent in transfer fees alone, but these were offset by the sales of Andros Townsend, Moussa Sissoko and Georginio Wijnaldum among others. Nevertheless, the Magpies were still under pressure to achieve promotion - a feat they managed with two games to spare. Benitez's side have battled with Brighton throughout the season for top spot, but since the Seagulls achieved promotion on 17 April they have dropped off the pace dramatically. Ultimately it was three straight wins for Newcastle and three matches without three points for Chris Hughton's side that told, giving the Toon the perfect end to the campaign.

""The boys will go back and play matches for their county teams. By the time the Champions Trophy [on 1 June] comes around we should hopefully be firing on all cylinders."" England coach Trevor Bayliss with thoughts on the squad dilemmas ahead:Â ""From a selection point of view we think there is not a lot
between the three keepers we have. It will be hard to leave Jonny [Bairstow]
out with the runs he scores. He has shown again today the value he brings the
team."" Ireland captain Will Porterfield:Â ""I thought we were much improved today. We put a lot of things right - we bowled well and kept going when the big partnership got going and it took Jonny Bairstow to play well to get them to that big total.

he is difficult to play. He has that X-factor.Â ""We are not sure [about his fitness] nor are the medical people at this stage. In the short term we will
need to keep a close eye on him. Hopefully as he gets older and has overs under
his belt he can perform in all forms of the game."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""Bristol was a more convincing win and today presented us with different challenges. There was some cloud cover this morning and the openers got us off to a fantastic start, I shared in a good partnership with Joe Root and then Jonny Bairstow and Adil Rashid saw us home after a little wobble.

Thoughts from England coach Trevor Bayliss ahead of the three-match ODI series against South Africa, beginning on 24 May: ""We know we have sterner tests coming up, against South
Africa and in the Champions Trophy. We can do no more than play and win well,"" he says. ""We will go into the three games against South Africa wanting
to win that series. If we are 2-0 up with a game to go we will look at the team
then."" After taking 1-24 in the first match at Bristol, Durham paceman Mark Wood consolidated his return from injury with some impressive pace in excess of 90mph and finished the match in style with an inswinging yorker as Ireland were all out for 243 in the 47th over, England winning by 85 runs. Ireland hit six sixes, one more than England. The O'Brien brothers hit three of those, here left-hander Niall dispatches one down the ground. Root is named man of the match and is asked if taking wickets gave him more pleasure than scoring runs:""Yes. Quite simply."" Root adds:""I feel in good order. It's been a slower start to theÂ seasonÂ than I would have liked but this has been a stepping stone into the Champions Trophy. We want to keep building momentum."" Root chipped in with a wicket in his first over and went on to claim two more with his off spin variations. He fell two short of a deserved half-century when he was given out caught behind after a review in the 14th over. Paul Stirling gave Ireland an electrifying start, bringing up the Ireland fifty in only the seventh over with a series of sweetly-struck strokes. Graeme SwannEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special Jonny Bairstow has really matured as a batsman. I love the follow-through he has - he's so solid and hits through the line. Jonny Bairstow was playing only his 25th ODI and perhaps only featured because of the absence of Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, but the Yorkshireman again proved his worth with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls, with seven fours and three sixes, to help England to 328-6.Â He shared a stand of 88 with his county colleague Adil Rashid, who made 39 before he was caught behind. Skipper Eoin Morgan top-scored with 76, featuring two sixes, including this one when he had scored only a single. England's Joe Root, speaking to Test Match Special after taking 3-52 with the ball:Â ""It's nice for (skipper) Eoin Morgan to have options with the ball and with players missing for this series, it's been nice to chip in. The more options we can have under pressure, the better. If somebody is having a tough day, we want people to be able to help them out.""
