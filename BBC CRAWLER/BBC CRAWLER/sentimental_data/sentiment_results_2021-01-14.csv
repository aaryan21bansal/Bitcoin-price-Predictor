"The governor of Amazonas state warned of a ""critical"" moment and has implemented a curfew Hospitals in the Brazilian city of Manaus have reached breaking point while treating Covid-19 patients, amid reports of severe oxygen shortages and desperate staff. The city, in Amazonas state, has seen a surge of deaths and infections. Health professionals, quoted by local media, warned ""many people"" could die due to lack of supplies and assistance. Brazil has recorded more than 205,000 virus deaths - the second-highest tally in the world, behind the US. A new coronavirus variant has recently emerged in Brazil, with several cases in travellers arriving in Japan traced back to the Amazonas region. Amazonas suffered heavy losses in the first wave of the pandemic but is also being badly hit by a new rise in infections. Refrigerated containers were brought to hospitals to help store bodies last week, as authorities declared a state of emergency. Jessem Orellana, from the Fiocruz-Amazonia scientific investigation institute, told the AFP news agency that some hospitals in Manaus had ""run out of oxygen"" with some centres becoming ""a type of suffocation chamber"" for patients. The researcher told Brazilian media she had received reports from the front-line of ""dramatic"" scenes playing out in some hospitals. How worrying are the new variants? Brazil's president: Unlikely Covid hero? The realities of schooling in rural Brazil Reports in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper described desperate staff having to try to keep patients alive through manual ventilation. In a widely shared video from the region, a female medical worker asks the internet for help: ""We're in an awful state. Oxygen has simply run out across the whole unit today."" ""There is no oxygen and lots of people are dying,""she says in the clip,external.  ""If anyone has any oxygen, please bring it to the clinic. There are so many people dying."" The UK has banned travellers from much of Latin America over a new variant detected in Brazil Amazonas Governor Wilson Lima said the state was ""in the most critical moment of the pandemic"" and has announced a nightly curfew will begin at 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday to try to stem the spread. Marcellus Campelo, a local health secretary, said the state needed three times the amount of oxygen it can produce locally and appealed for help. Brazil's vice-president shared images on Twitter of the air force transporting hospital supplies, including oxygen cylinders and stretchers, to the city as reports of the situation spread throughout the country.

Health officials also say some patients will be airlifted to other states for treatment due to the demand for intensive care units, Reuters reports. Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same characteristics: ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" Mr Naveca said that they did not yet have any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question,"" he said.

Cwm Taf covers Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil, which have thehighest and second highest Covid death rates. ""It's tough times,"" said Cwm Taf's medical director Nick Lyons. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he ""would not be surprised"" if other health boards were forced to do the same soon, if case rates did not come down. ""There is real harm being done... because of the level of hospital admissions,"" he said. ""Our critical care units are at 150% of their capacity and that has very real consequences.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason A ban on travellers to the UK from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde will begin on Friday due to a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules would come in from 04:00 GMT. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. On Thursday the UK reported a further 1,248 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The previous day had seen a record figure of 1,564.There were also another 48,682 daily Covid cases. The number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,918,252 - up by 278,943 from Wednesday. How worrying are the new Covid variants? New test rule for England arrivals pushed back Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? The new travel ban,externalapplies to people who have travelled from, or through, the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. Portugal, including the islands of Madeira and the Azores, is also banned, along with the central American nation of Panama and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. Mr Shapps said he ""can't provide an end date"" to the new rules. He said the current restrictions on global travel meant he didn't ""expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America and we're not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result"". Portugal had been included ""given its strong travel links with Brazil"", he said, but added that there would be an exemption for hauliers travelling from the country to allow the transportation of essential goods. He said suspending travel from that European country would act ""as another way to reduce the risk of importing infections"". Qatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba have also been removed from the UK's travel corridor lists, meaning anyone arriving from these countries after 04:00 GMT on Saturday will have to quarantine for 10 days. Jon Dent, 31, from Wolverhampton, travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could see their daughter Luiza, one, for the first time. They are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very concerned"" about the Brazilian variant of the virus. New variants of Covid-19 have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Several Central and South American nations had already restricted travel from the UK, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, while others such as Argentina and Uruguay have closed their borders to non-resident foreign nationals. The Department for Transport said under the ban no exemptions would apply, including those for employment, and people who live with someone who has travelled from one of the banned countries will have to self-isolate for 10 days. BBC News online health editor Michelle Roberts said there wasno sign that any of the new variants were more dangerous, with scientists confident that vaccines would work against them. Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said the new variant was ""of concern"" and its origin was ""undoubtedly"" from the Amazon region. He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern,"" he said, adding: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve."" By Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter, News Online Latin America editor Brazil has recorded the second highest number of Covid deaths in the world The Covid pandemic may have arrived in South America later than in Europe but it did so with a vengeance. In May, the World Health Organization warned that it had become the new epicentre of the pandemic with Brazil soon joining the top three countries with the most confirmed cases. But the travel ban is not about numbers; some of the countries on the list have had relatively few Covid cases, like Guyana with fewer than 7,000. This is about the new strain and how it could spread quickly through travel in the region. Brazil borders 10 countries and cross-border business is brisk. Panama, also on the list even though it is further to the north, is a major travel hub for flights from South America to Europe and the US. And tourism has not stopped either. On 25 December, Brazil suspended all flights from the UK over the new UK strain, but air travel from other countries continued, especially over Christmas - the main holiday season in the southern hemisphere. The travel ban comes after it was announced arequirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journeywill now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. The Scottish government said the delay meant it would also wait until Monday. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days. Mr Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday to allow British nationals to be able to get home, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people would be ""bewildered"" by the delay and would ""feel that we're exposed"".

"Two new fast-spreading subvariants of Omicron are causing fresh surges of Covid around the world. BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave. They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe. They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants. Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too. Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit. BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall. But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily. This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths. As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Extra Covid booster in spring for over-75s and high risk How many people have been vaccinated so far? Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested. Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. How many people have had boosters so far?

"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete apassenger locator form,externalbefore departure. Digital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalorNorthern Ireland,external. Test results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish. European Union residents can use theEU Digital Covid Certificateto show their vaccination status or test results.

You are responsible forchecking the entry requirements for any other countries you wish to visit,,externalas well as the local Covid restrictions which are in force. These can change quickly. Many UK familieshave cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islandsbecause children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. Very few countries allow unrestricted access to those who have not been vaccinated. It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world still require all UK travellers to take a pre-departure PCR test before arrival.

"Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will now be required for everyone travelling to England from 04:00 GMT on Monday. The rules had been due to come into force on Friday, but the government said people needed time ""to prepare"". Those arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. Anyone arriving from places not on the UK's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. The Scottish government is planning to impose the same rules and has had to defer them coming into effect as a result of changes in England. ""This meant Scotland was also obliged to delay implementation as we need sight of their final regulations in order to properly draft and approve the relevant Scottish regulations,"" a spokeswoman said. It is expected the requirement will come into force in Scotland at 04:00 GMT on Monday as well. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce plans for pre-arrival testing in the coming days. Who needs a negative test to travel to the UK? Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Announcing the deferral on Twitter,Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said:,external""To give international arrivals time to prepare, passengers will be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test before departure to England from Monday 18 January at 4am."" He also reminded travellers to fill out thePassenger Locator Form,external- used in track and trace - and added that those without proof of a negative test faced a fine of Â£500. Problems with testing availability and capacity mean some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda until 04:00 GMT on 21 January. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently. Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. The government has said all forms of PCR test will be accepted, as will other forms of test with ""97% specificity, 80% sensitivity"". The move comes asa further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test- the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. Wednesday's figure brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there had now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. Meanwhile on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""concerned"" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it was not yet clear how effective existing vaccines would be against the latest new variant. Mr Johnson said the UK was taking steps to make sure it was not brought into the country. A government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days.

"The prime minister said there was no need, yet, for a new national lockdown French Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced a new evening curfew will begin nationally across France starting at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday. The move is a tightening of a curfew already in place since December, which restricts movement from 20:00-06:00. Announcing the measure on Thursday, Mr Castex described the country's situation as ""worrying"" with infections remaining at a ""high plateau"". He also announced new restrictions for people arriving into the country. France has so far recorded more than 69,000 coronavirus deaths - the seventh-highest death toll in the world. The new national curfew will stay in place for at least 15 days and means everyone must be at home, unless they are returning from school or work, by 18:00 every day. All shops and businesses will have to close when the curfew begins, except for emergency services. How worrying are the new Covid variants? Which countries have been hit the hardest? Tracking the Covid vaccine across Europe The tighter evening restriction was already in place in some hard-hit eastern regions of the country before Thursday's announcement and, according to the French Scientific Council, has led to infection rates slowing. However some people have criticised the curfew, claiming that it will create larger groups of people, all trying to get home in time before it comes into force. Women's rugby coach Felicie Guinot lives in Marseille, where an earlier curfew is already in place. She told AP news agency thatrush hour traffic in Marseille was heavy,external. ""It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6pm,"" she said. All those arriving from outside the EU will now have to test negative for the virus within 72 hours before their travel into France, and then isolate for seven days and test negative again, Mr Castex said. This video can not be played Are pandemics the new normal? The border controls are partly to limit the extent to which new mutant strains of the virus spreading abroad can become dominant in France. There is particular concern over the more transmissible variant first detected in the UK - which the French health minister says now accounts for about 1-1.5% of new cases nationally. ""We must do everything to prevent this variant from spreading in France,"" Health Minister Olivier Veran told a Thursday news conference. The prime minister said Thursday that the situation in France is ""under control compared to neighbouring countries but still fragile"" with pressure on hospitals remaining high. The curfew is seen as a way to avoid a full national lockdown, but Mr Castex said further restrictions would be imposed ""without delay"" if the situation deteriorated further. It is hoped that an earlier curfew will put a stop to people gathering for drinks in the evenings, despite the government advising citizens to limit their social contacts to six people. More than 2,500 break rules at illegal rave The challenge in speeding up France's vaccination drive The country will aim to carry out at least one million Covid-19 tests per month in schools to help keep them open, but indoor sport activities have been banned again. The government is also aiming to have more than one million people vaccinated against the virus by the end of January, amid criticism of a slow rollout by some. So far, 318,000 people have been vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry. ""The sooner we can vaccinate the most vulnerable, the sooner our hospitals will be spared the risk of being overwhelmed,"" Mr Castex said Thursday. The earlier six o'clock curfew is important because it should help to ""counter the apÃ©ro effect"". These words are from Stanislas GuÃ©rini, a leading figure in President Macron's party. What he means is that the two hours between six and eight o'clock have been identified as a weak spot in the government's anti-Covid strategy because that is when - even after all the warnings - people still can't resist getting together for post-work, pre-dinner aperitifs. The six o'clock measure is already in force in a quarter of France, where apparently it is having an effect. Extending it nationwide represents a graduated response to a situation which the government says is worrying, but not alarming. An average of 16,000 new cases a day is way more than the official target, but it is also a lot less than daily case numbers in the UK. Covid uptake in intensive care hospital beds is likewise on a ""high plateau"" - persistent but not out of control. So the French government will continue with this weekly fine-tuning, hoping that - with a vaccination programme that is at last gathering speed - the skies will possibly clear by the summer. France is one of several countries to currently enforce a curfew to curb the spread of the virus. InHungary, people must have a written note from their employers in order to leave their homes between 20:00 and 05:00. Latviahas brought in a curfew every Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 25 January. People cannot go outside between 22:00 and 05:00 unless they have a certificate. Belgiumhas different curfews depending on which region you are in. Flanders has a curfew from midnight until 05:00, while Brussels and Wallonia have asked residents to stay at home from 22:00 until 06:00. InItaly, people must stay inside from 22:00 until 05:00. Ministers in the Netherlands are said to be looking into a possible curfew there, according to local media. Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?

"Footballer Marcus Rashford has led campaigns over child poverty Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy. The group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge,have written to the PM,externalasking him to ""fix"" the system long-term. They called for a strategy to help ""end child food poverty"" before the summer holidays. No 10 said ""no child will ever go hungry"" because of the Covid pandemic. The call for a wide review comes after another row over free school mealsduring February half-term. The government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday. Councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available."" What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel How many children need free meals? As well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders. Organised by the Food Foundation charity,the letter,externalsaid it was time to ""step back and review the policy in more depth"". They called for an ""urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK"" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at: the threshold for being eligible for free school meals funding - including whether the current allowance is enough how schools can be helped to provide the best quality meals the impact of Covid on children in low-income families making sure there is no stigma The signatories praised the Department for Education's ""swift response"" toreports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the ""robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome"". But, they added that ""following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic"", now was the time for a review. This video can not be played Tom Kerridge: There has to be a solution to free school meals Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen ""crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals"". ""The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing."" Chef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. ""We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,"" he told the same programme. The signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. ""We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,"" the letter said. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. ""Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step."" Anti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: ""We need to be feeding children right now."" She added: ""While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. ""This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon.

"This video can not be played James Howells says he wishes he had never thrown away the hard drive A man who threw away a laptop hard drive containing bitcoin he believes is now worth about Â£210m wants his council to let him search for it in landfill. James Howells had 8,000bitcoins, a virtual currency, on the hard drive,which he mistakenly threw away in 2013. He said he was willing to donate 25% of the value of the bitcoins to his home city of Newport in south Wales - about Â£52.5m - if he found the hard drive. Newport council said excavation was not possible under its licensing permit. Mr Howells said if he was to recover the hard drive, he would want the money to be put into a ""Covid relief fund"" for people in Newport to use ""no questions asked"". What is bitcoin? Man has two guesses to unlock bitcoin fortune PayPal allows bitcoin and crypto spending ""Imagine how great it would be to say 'I've given everyone in the city a few hundred pounds',"" he told the BBC. Mr Howells bought the bitcoins for almost nothing in 2009, but the hard drive ended up in a drawer after he spilled a drink on his laptop. He kept the hard drive in his office drawer and ""totally forgot about bitcoin all together"" - so when he had a clear out, he believed everything had been taken off it. When he threw the hard drive away in 2013, the value of the bitcoins was about $7.5m (Â£4.6m). But now they are worth almost 50 times more, with the cost of a single bitcoin currently just over Â£28,000 after a surge in value. This video can not be played James Howells: ""When I went up to the landfill site yesterday my first thought was 'I've got not chance'"" He said he has asked Newport council if he could search the landfill several times, but had not been granted permission. ""I offered the local authority 10% of the recovered funds in order to give me permission to search on their property and unfortunately they said no at the time,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""What actually happened after that was the value of bitcoin skyrocketed even further. In 2017 the value of my hard drive was approximately Â£125m, at which point I made them another offer of 10% and unfortunately that offer was refused as well. James Howells said he wants to donate a quarter of the money to the people of Newport ""I haven't actually made an offer to them today, but I'm willing to increase my offer to them to 25%. On today's valuation that would be Â£52.5m and I'd like to put that into a Covid relief fund for the citizens of Newport."" Mr Howells said searching for the discarded hard drive would ""not be as hard as you might think"" as he would employ a professional team - and knows when he threw it away so could use that to find a grid reference of where the hard drive is buried. He added investors had offered to cover the cost of excavating the landfill, in exchange for a large proportion of the recovered bitcoin. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Mr Howells said he wants to meet with the council to discuss what he said would be a ""win-win-win"" situation for him, the council and the city. But a spokeswoman for the council said: ""Newport City Council has been contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins. ""The first time was several months after Mr Howells first realised the hardware was missing. ""The council has told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licencing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.

"This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? US Republicans in Congress are deeply divided after 10 members split with their party to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the third ranking House Republican, is facing calls to resign her party leadership role after her vote to impeach. The lawmakers who voted against Mr Trump face threats of violence, and have increased security, they say. It comes as Mr Trump prepares to leave office and faces a trial in the Senate. The House of Representatives voted by 232 votes to 197 on Wednesday to impeach him for allegedly inciting rioters who stormed the Capitol last week. The FBI has warned of possible armed protests plannedfor Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the run-up to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday. Ms Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman whose father was vice-president to Republican George W Bush, faced immediate calls to resign after voting to impeach Mr Trump for inciting insurrection against the US government. ""I'm not going anywhere. This is a vote of conscience,"" said Ms Cheney, after Mr Trump's conservative defenders in Congress called for her to quit. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots Liz Cheney (r) chatting with Democrat Jamie Raskin in Congress on Wednesday ""It's one where there are different views in our conference. But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis,"" she told reporters on Wednesday, as Trump was impeached for a historic second time. Another Republican has said he and several colleagues have purchased body armour and have been forced to change their normal routines after receiving threats of violence. ""It's sad that we have to get to that point, but you know our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,"" Michigan Republican Peter Meijer told MSNBC on Thursday. ""We don't know what's going to happen next. We weren't expecting for the Capitol to get overrun for the first time in 200 years,"" he said. ""And so in this unprecedented environment with an unprecedented degree of fear, of divisiveness and hatred, we have to account for every scenario."" For two hours, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote on impeachment while National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. Most Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump, but instead argued that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and called on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity. ""Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. ""That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters."" Security has been stepped up around Congress a week before Joe Biden's inauguration Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. He urged them to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard, but also to ""fight like hell"" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen. Following Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter while the building was placed on lockdown. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots The article of impeachment states that Mr Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted"". It says he then repeated these claims and ""wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol"", leading to violence and loss of life. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump was charged with inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?The House of Representatives has impeached him, moving the case to the Senate for a trial. But a trial will not be carried out before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January So what does it mean?A trial can happen after his term ends, and senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again The Senate - the upper house of the US Congress - will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was ""simply no chance that a fair or serious trial"" could conclude in time given ""the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents"" that govern trials involving presidents. A two-thirds majority will be needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. As many as 20 Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could then hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again, which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024. The first impeachment of Mr Trump was in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. He was acquitted by the Senate.

"Jon Schaffer, pictured wearing a blue jacket, was seen in news photos taken during the riot Exactly 100 days since the 6 January riot that saw a pro-Trump mob storm the US Capitol, prosecutors have their first guilty plea. Jon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group, pleaded guilty to two charges - obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon. Schaffer, who is also a heavy metal guitarist in the band Iced Earth, had originally faced six charges including using a chemical irritant designed for grizzly bears on police officers during clashes. He turned himself to FBI agents in Indiana two weeks after his arrest, and after a photo of him inside the Capitol wearing a hat reading ""Oath Keepers Lifetime Member"" appeared on the front pages of US newspapers. He is facing 30 years in prison and is expected to co-operate with investigators. The suspects in the Capitol riot are a varied group: they include an ousted West Virginia lawmaker, several police officers and a left-wing activist from Utah. Most of the rioters were allowed to leave the crime scene, forcing investigators to conduct a national manhunt for the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the halls of Congress. Investigators for the District of Columbia says they have identified over 540 suspects and charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege. Just weeks after the rampage in January, FBI officials said they had already been inundated with 140,000 videos and photos from members of the public. Officials say they are considering filing serious charges of seditious activity against some individuals who were involved in the siege on the Capitol. According to federal criminal code, seditious conspiracy means an effort to conspire to overthrow the US government. The punishment is severe: up to 20 years in prison. The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters Jacob Anthony Chansley wore horns and a fur hat inside the Senate chamber The rioters facing federal charges hail from 42 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to theGeorge Washington University extremism tracker,external. Only a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. Most came from districts that voted for Joe Biden in the November election. In March, the FBI made its first arrest of a Trump appointee, former State Department aide Federico Guillermo Klein. Mr Klein, 42, is accused of multiple felonies related to the riot, including beating police with a stolen riot shield. He was still employed by the State Department as a staff assistant when he joined the mob on 6 January. He is also a former Trump campaign employee, US media report. Five of those arrested were police officers. Nearly 30 were active-duty or retired members of the military. Five revelations from Capitol riot arrests About 90% of those arrested have been white, according to an analysis by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Most have been over the age of 40, surprising given that the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s. Many of those arrested were employed, or even wealthy, including Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California. She was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment. Jenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol. Analysis by BBC Monitoring and BBC Reality Check Robert Keith Packer One of the most striking images from that day showed a man wearing a hoodie with the words: ""Camp Auschwitz"". Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were murdered during World War Two by Germany. Mr Packer was arrested in Virginia and has been charged with trespassing in a federal building and ""violent entry and disorderly conduct"" on Capitol grounds. Mr Packer wore a garment with the slogan ""Camp Auschwitz"" Jake Angeli - 'Q Shaman' Jacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli or as he describes himself the ""Q Shaman"", is a well-known follower of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory who lives in Glendale, Arizona. QAnon supporters believe Mr Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. Known for appearing with a painted face, fur hat and horns while carrying a ""Q sent me"" banner in public, Mr Chansley, 33, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after appearing in multiple images inside the halls of Congress and the Senate chamber. In videos posted to his social media accounts, he shouts about child-trafficking in front of government buildings or inside shopping malls, and attends pro-Trump or QAnon-linked ""save our children"" rallies. Like many of his fellow QAnon followers, Mr Chansley says he believes Covid-19 is a hoax. Mr Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as ""people who love our country."" Officer Eugene Goodman confronts Doug Jensen Doug Jensen - QAnon Doug Jensen, 41, from Des Moines, Iowa, appeared in one video showing a lone African American officer holding back the mob. Mr Jensen has been arrested and faces five federal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct and obstructing a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder. In it, he can be seen chasing a police officer up a flight of stairs inside the Capitol wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan ""trust the plan"". The Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' Mr Jensen later identified himself on his Twitter account, tweeting: ""You like my shirt?"" and ""Meâ¦"" under images of him inside the Capitol shared by fellow QAnon supporters. On his Twitter, Mr Jensen regularly expresses support for President Trump, engages with well-known QAnon accounts, and tweets QAnon phrases such as WWG1WGA - short for ""where we go one we go all"" - a rallying cry for the conspiracy's adherents. Nick Ochs - Proud Boys Nick Ochs was arrested at an airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, by the FBI, as he returned home from Washington DC. He's accused of unlawful entry of restricted buildings or grounds, after he posted a picture smoking a cigarette inside the Capitol building, tweeting: ""Hello from the Capital lol"". Mr Ochs describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii"". The Proud Boys is an anti-immigrant and all male far-right group founded in 2016. President Trump addressed this group specifically in the first presidential debate. In response to a question about white supremacists and militias he said: ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by."" Richard Barnett Richard Barnett is the man pictured with his feet on a desk in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. He was also pictured outside the Capitol with a personalised envelope he took from her office. He's been arrested for unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records. Mr Barnett is 60 years old and from Arkansas. Local media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally following the presidential election - the movement that supports Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Derrick Evans Less than a month after he was sworn in as a Republican delegate in the West Virginia state legislature, Mr Evans filmed himself pushing through the crowd as he stormed the Capitol wearing what appears to be a motorcycle helmet. ""We're going in,"" he said in the now-deleted Facebook live stream. ""We did it! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!"" he yelled, adding, ""patriots inside, baby!"" His participation in the riot led lawmakers in his home state to consider cutting off his access to the West Virginia statehouse. But within a week of the riot, he had resigned. He is facing federal charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Riley June Williams tried to delete her accounts, prosecutors say Riley June Williams The 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman, is accused of stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The FBI has said that Ms Williams' former romantic partner told them that she had appeared in pictures of the Capitol riot. She allegedly had said that she hoped to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence agents. An aide to Mrs Pelosi said the computer was only used for presentations. It has yet to be recovered by investigators. Federal cases are ongoing across the country and could lead to some significant prison sentences for those involved. Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in February: ""The scope and scale of this investigation in these cases are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably [Department of Justice] history."" Dozens of suspects have requested public defenders - lawyers provided by the government - leaving taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in defendants' legal bills. The cases have also flooded the Washington DC legal system, where semi-returned judges have been called upon to hear the influx of cases. At least one defendant has argued that their case should be heard out of Washington because they would be unable to get a fair trial there. At least seven of the key suspects have told investigators that they travelled to the Capitol after President Trump told them to go in a speech that preceded the riot. The so-called Q Shaman requested a pardon from Mr Trump before he left office, citing ""the peaceful and compliant fashion in which Mr Chansley comported himself"" during the riot. According to a local ABC news station, a judge has agreed that Mr Chansley should be ""provided food in line with a shaman's strict organic diet"" after he refused to eat the meals provided at the jailhouse. Riley June Williams, the woman accused of stealing a congressional laptop, was ordered to stay off the internet after she allegedly attempted to delete her information and encouraged others to do the same. A man allegedly seen in viral photos carrying a Confederate flag in the Capitol during the riots was charged on 14 January. Authorities in Delaware charged Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter with entering a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct. According to court documentscited by the Delaware News Journal,external, the duo got into the Capitol building through a window that Hunter helped break, before they ""verbally confronted"" US Capitol Police officers and the son took a selfie. TheConfederate flagis widely seen as a racist symbol as it was the banner of the slaveholding southern states that lost the US Civil War (1861-65). A left-wing activist was also arrested after tweeting video of himself inside the US Capitol as protesters breached security. John Sullivan, 26, was charged with entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct. He claimed in media interviews that he was just ""documenting"" the rampage, though the affidavit notes he has no press credentials. The court document,externalsays Mr Sullivan can be heard saying in a video he filmed of the Capitol riot: ""Let's burn this shit down."" He has identified himself in media interviews as a Black Lives Matter supporter, but rejects any association with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left protesters. Following the death of George Floyd last year, Mr Sullivan founded an activist group in Utah that advocates for racial justice. He was charged in July 2020 with felony riot and criminal mischief over civil unrest in Provo, Utah. Two men who were allegedly pictured bringing plastic restraints into the Capitol were also arrested this month. Authorities say Eric Gavelek Munchel is the individual seen carrying a number of plastic zip ties inside the Senate chamber. He was detained in Tennessee. Larry Rendell Brock, who is accused of entering the Capitol with a white flex cuff - a restraining device used by law enforcement - was arrested in Texas. So far, neither has been accused of plotting to use the restraints, but face disorderly conduct and violent entry charges.

According to officials, she posted a video where she said: ""We did break down Nancy Pelosi's office door"" Klete Keller, a two-time Olympic gold medallist swimmer, has been charged after online sleuths spotted that he wore his Olympic jacket to the Capitol Robert Sandford, a recently retired firefighter from a Philadelphia suburb, is accused of assaulting officers by throwing a fire extinguisher at them Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson, off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Virginia, are accused of trespassing and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds Tam Phamquit his job as a Houston police officer after his police chief told reporters he had been part of the crowd that ""penetrated"" Congress.

"Bangor student Michelle Francis said students had hardly used rooms and had not been able to use facilities on campus Hundreds of students are preparing to take part in rent strikes after paying for ""hardly used"" rooms during the pandemic. Some Welsh universities have alreadyoffered refunds to students who have been living away due to Covid-19. But students in Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor claim they are being treated unfairly and are threatening to withhold rent. Universities said they were trying to work out the implications of Covid-19. And a solicitor warned students they could face legal action for not paying rent, with long-term implications possible if they lose. Face-to-face teaching was suspended and many students moved back home before Christmas as coronavirus cases continued to rise. Staggered returns are being introduced in order to ""help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation"", according to the Welsh Government. Students attending universities across Wales had demanded rent rebates. Cardiff University apology after students called 'idiots' Wales' universities delay return to face-to-face learning Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree They said they had not been living in the rooms or using facilities, despite paying for them, because they were abiding by Welsh Government guidelines. Cardiff Metropolitan University, Aberystwyth University, Swansea University, Bangor University and Cardiff University have now offered eligible students rebates or discounts for time not spent living on campus. University of South Wales said it will be offering a ""rent holiday"" on university-owned accommodation in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, for the period 4 January to 12 February. University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) said on Thursday it is now offering refunds to students who have not returned to university-owned accommodation while teaching is solely online. But students say the offers are inadequate for students already paying Â£9,000-a-year tuition fees at a time when most of the teaching was online, and they had been unable to use facilities in halls. While the students cannot hold their protests in person due to coronavirus laws, hundreds are now planning to cancel their direct debits, withholding thousands of pounds of rent from universities. Bangor University is offering some students refunds Michelle Francis, who formed the Bangor Rent Strike campaign, said the university's offer of a 10% discount to eligible students living in university-owned accommodation did not go far enough. She said students who had chosen to go home for Christmas were not eligible, despite being unable to use facilities paid for during the first term. ""[We were] advised to have left university from the beginning of December and to come back at 8 February,"" she said. ""That's 25% of our halls that we've been paying and we're not there... we should be allowed to have that back."" So far over 300 students have joined the campaign to cancel their direct debits paid to Welsh universities and campaigners said the numbers were growing daily. On Wednesday, Cardiff University joined other Welsh universities in offering a rent rebate to students living in university-owned accommodation during the pandemic. But the full rebate, for the time students are unable to return to live in their accommodation, will not be applied until April. Swansea University has also confirmed a rent reduction to students in university halls who have been asked to remain at home. Oisin Mulholland of Swansea Rent Strike said the group wanted the university to commit to fairly ""assessing the situation"", including for the coming term, and students who had already moved in should be given rebates as well. ""There was a window in January, where the Welsh Government said return, but the English government said don't return, and the university said nothing,"" he said. ""Many students came back and are now trapped in Swansea and can't go back because of lockdown"" Ibrahim Khan said students were struggling and needed the rebate immediately Ibrahim Khan, of the Cardiff Rent Strike campaign, said the rebate was ""too late"" for students struggling financially now. ""The university should be giving us the rebate this January as opposed to the third instalment in April,"" he said. Lawyers have warned that students would in breach of contract if they cancel the direct debit for their rent. SiÃ´n FÃ´n, a solicitor at Darwin Gray, encouraged students to discuss the issue with their families and student unions before taking action. ""I think a case could be brought forward pretty easily against somebody not paying rent,"" he said. But he said students may have a case against the university due to not being able to access advertised facilities, but if the university took legal action it could have long-term consequences for individuals. ""If the students lose, and even after losing don't pay the rent, that would come up on credit scores, or with the bank, if they're trying to get a mortgage or a credit card it would come up on their record,"" he warned. This video can not be played ""How am I going to afford to do my food shop... if I can't go to work?"" A spokesperson for Cardiff University said technical reasons meant they had to wait until the April instalment of accommodation fees to provide the rebate. Swansea University said some students had already returned when the stay at home guidance was issued, and it was working through the ""implications of this"". ""To help with this the university will not generate invoices for any students with university accommodation until May when we have been able to look at these cases,"" a spokesman said. Bangor University said it did not wish to add anything further following its rebate announcement. The Welsh Government said it had provided an extra Â£40m to help universities, including Â£10m for towards student hardship and support. ""It would seem fair that students should be eligible for a rebate for the period when a course is online only and we welcome moves by universities to address this,"" a spokesman said. ""We are actively considering how we can support our students and universities even further."" Students call for university accommodation refunds University tells students not to return to campus Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Michel Barnier said the UK had turned down the EU's ""fairly ambitious proposals"" The EU has insisted it was the UK government's choice to end visa-free touring for musicians on the continent, following an outcry from performers. Officials in Brussels told the BBC that the UK ""refused"" a plan that would have let musicians tour without visas. The response came after Downing Street re-affirmed that its own ""ambitious"" proposals had been rejected by the EU. The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the result was one of the ""inevitable consequences"" of Brexit. ""I very much regretted that the British didn't have more ambition for people's mobility,"" Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday. ""From last March, we made fairly ambitious proposals in terms of mobility, including for specific categories such as journalists, performers, musicians and others,"" he went on. ""But you need to be two to make a deal."" Pressure has been mountingon the two sides to negotiate an exemption to the new restrictions for musicians, with performers and crews saying livelihoods could be at risk. Since Brexit, British musicians and crews are no longer guaranteed visa-free travel and may need extra work permits to play in certain European countries. Under the terms of the deal, British bands can tour Europe for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. But tours in Germany and Spain, for instance, will now require extra visas for paid work, while those in France and The Netherlands will not. Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes performed at Primavera Sound in Barcelona in 2019 Popular European touring routes could now see them take on extra costs and paperwork. According to the Association of British Orchestras, truck drivers carrying stage equipment must now return to the UK after visiting two EU member states. Pressure mounts over EU tour visas for musicians Music touring proposals were 'rejected by the EU' A petition signed by more than 250,000 people - including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa - is calling on the the government to ""negotiate a free cultural work permit"" that would allow ""bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment"". The government later responded to the petition, saying the EU ""turned down proposals"", while noting that ""there is scope to return to this in the future"". On Thursday, Musicians' Union general secretary Horace Trubridge demanded greater support from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for UK artists hoping to tour in Europe again once it's safe to do so. A ""reciprocal agreement"" for EU artists arriving into the UK would be ""in the interests of the UK and EU"", he said. ""Our industry has been incredibly badly hit by the Covid-19 crisis and if our members are also restricted by additional costs and red tape on touring once things start to go back to normal, we will see a real downturn in what is a unique British success story: Music."" Mr Johnson vowed on Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions to meet MPs to discuss the matter. ""I know that our friends in the EU will be wanting to go further to improve things for not just musicians, but business travellers of all kinds. There is a mutual benefit,"" he said. An EU spokesperson told the BBC: ""The UK has chosen to no longer allow the free movement of EU citizens to the UK. It also refused to include a chapter on mobility in the agreement. ""These choices inevitably mean that travel between the EU and the UK - including for business purposes - will no longer be as easy as it was while the UK was a member state."" He added that the UK ""refused to include a commitment on visa-free short stays"", which could have meant people like musicians, sportspeople and journalists would not have needed individual visas. ""As a result, it is now up to each member state to determine if a visa is required for short-stay visits for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. This is fully in line with EU law."" The EU would not be drawn on whether it would re-open talks around music touring visas. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says the EU are to blame The government has previously said it ""pushed for a more ambitious agreementwith the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians and others, but our proposals were rejected by the EU"". On Tuesday, it added that ""the door remains open should the EU change its mind"". Then on Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden blamed the EU for ""letting down music on both sides of the Channel - not us"". Prof Catherine Barnard, deputy director of research organisation UK In A Changing Europe, told BBC News: ""The bottom line is that the EU did offer up to 90 days, and with the possibility of being paid. ""I suspect the UK probably said no because they have a very hard line on anything that may even look like free movement of persons, which of course the UK had committed itself to stopping.""

"Despite the huge need to free up space in hospitals, some care homes say insurance issues make it impossible for them to accept Covid-19 patients. In October, the government launched a scheme for designated care homes to take patients recovering from the virus but insurance is a stumbling block. Sir David Behan, head of the UK's largest care home company, HC-One, says insurance has become a major concern. The government says it is working to resolve the issue. ""We are aware the adult social care insurance market is changing in response to the pandemic, and recognise some care providers may encounter difficulties as their policies come up for renewal,"" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge Are care homes ready for the second wave? Care home coronavirus tests a 'game-changer' One Hampshire care home says it will have to stop taking patients within days because its insurance will expire. Waterside House in Netley, Hampshire usually provides holidays and respite care for people with disabilities. But since the autumn it has been taking Covid-positive patients discharged from hospitals on the south coast. They are looked after on a separate floor from other residents, and the home has had to meet high infection control standards. Home manager Sarah Knight said demand for the 31 beds is unparalleled and added: ""I've been in nursing a long, long time, and I have never known anything like this. ""People end up in an ambulance sat outside hospitals for hours and hours, or they end up on a trolley in A&E in a corridor for hours and hours. ""By offering the best that we've got here, we can reduce some of that burden."" Jan Tregelles is chief executive of the charity Revitalise which runs Waterside House The government originally hoped there would be 500 designated care homes taking in Covid-positive patients. But Waterside House is one of only 129 which have been set up to take those who have not completed 14 days in isolation. However, its public indemnity insurance protection, which it needs in case someone contracts Covid there, runs out at the end of January. Waterside House is run by the charity Revitalise, whose chief executive, Jan Tregelles, said they have tried everything, but will soon have to start turning away people. ""It's shocking,"" she says. ""We are truly helpless. We have a fantastic team of nurses and colleagues already. ""The facilities are here, everything's arranged and we can't step up to support our communities at this time."" One resident, Alan Washbourne, who has been living at Waterside House since he was discharged from hospital during the first wave of the pandemic, said: ""I feel quite safe here."" He is not on the Covid floor of the home, and added: ""If I were to go to somewhere else, which is possible, I might not feel quite so safe."" Alan Washbourne has been at Waterside House since April last year After so many deaths last spring, many care homes  will not consider taking patients who are Covid-positive, even with extra infection control measures. Meanwhile, growing numbers of staff are off sick or self-isolating, leaving care homes facing shortages. And many are also finding it difficult to get the public indemnity insurance. Sir David Behan is chairman of HC-One, the UK's largest care home provider Since November, HC-One, which is the UK's largest care home provider, has had to cover its own Covid risks because it cannot get the insurance. Sir David said it is one of the reasons why they have not taken part in the designated places scheme. ""You've got solicitors' firms advertising, taking cases up against care companies,"" he says. ""So, this isn't a theoretical risk that there may be proceedings, it's an actual risk, and therefore we need cover. ""The NHS wouldn't operate without similar liability cover and that's what we need to see, and I think governments have a role to play working with the insurance industry to work to find a solution."" The Department for Health and Social Care said it was making efforts to determine what actions it could take.

"The licence fee is the ""least worst"" way of funding the BBC, its incoming chairman Richard Sharp has said. But Mr Sharp told MPs he had an ""open mind"" about how the corporation should be funded in the future, and it ""may be worth reassessing"" the current system. He also said he didn't think the BBC's Brexit coverage was biased overall, but ""there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced"". Question Time ""seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers"", he said. BBC Three's Normal People was one of the corporation's biggest hits last year The Â£157.50 licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that. Mr Sharp, who spent 23 years working as a banker for Goldman Sachs, told the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee: ""At 43p a day, the BBC represents terrific value."" Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? The government is currently reviewing whether its cost should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence. Mr Sharp said he was ""not in favour of decriminalisation"". He said other possible options for funding the BBC in the future could include a household tax like the one used in Germany, ""which amounts to the same amount of money"". He added: ""So when we next get the chance to review the structure of this then it may be worth reassessing."" Fiona Bruce hosts BBC One's political debate show Question Time Asked whether he believed the BBC's coverage of Brexit had been unbalanced, he replied: ""No, actually I don't. ""I believe there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced. ""So if you ask me if I think Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers, the answer is yes, but the breadth of the coverage I thought was incredibly balanced, in a highly toxic environment that was extremely polarised."" Question Time has said it has robust processes in place to ensure balance on its panels. Who is the BBC's new chairman, Richard Sharp? Mr Sharp said he was ""considered to be a Brexiteer"" and had donated around Â£400,000 to the Conservative Party over the past 20 years. He said the biggest issue now facing the BBC is impartiality, and that ""trust in leadership and trust in processes"" must be rebuilt after high-profile equal pay cases with journalists such as Carrie Gracie and Samira Ahmed. ""Clearly some of the problems it's had recently are really rather terrible and reflect a culture that needs to be rebuilt, so everybody who cherishes the BBC and works at the BBC feels proud and happy to work there,"" he said. ""Then in my view that would produce a better output inevitably."" Gracie calls BBC equal pay report a 'whitewash' BBC boss 'prepared to fire stars who break rules' Mr Sharp also told the committee he would give his Â£160,000 salary as BBC chairman to charity. When asked ""what's in it for you?"" Mr Sharp, whose heritage is Jewish, said: ""We're all a product of our upbringing and I was very fortunate with the parents I have, my great grandparents came to this country escaping tyranny. ""I think I won the lottery in life to be British and if I can make a contribution, I couldn't be happier to. ""The BBC is part of the fabric of all our national identities, it offers education and enrichment and is also important for our position in the world... It is a massive privilege to be chair of the BBC."" Sir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February.

"This video can not be played Richard Leonard: 'Leadership speculation was harming Labour' Richard Leonard has resigned as Scottish Labour leader, saying it is in the best interests of the party for him to stand down. Mr Leonard said he believed speculation about his leadership had become a ""distraction"". And he said he would be stepping down with immediate effect. His resignation comes just months ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held  in May. Mr Leonard had been leader of the party for three years after succeeding Kezia Dugdale. The former union official had faced open calls to quit from some of his own MSPs last year amid concerns that his leadership style could damage the party in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament election. Profile: Who is Richard Leonard? Four Scottish Labour MSPs call for Leonard to quit Polls have suggested that many Scottish Labour supporters struggle to recognise him, and he is closely associated with former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Scottish Labour had dominated politics in Scotland for decades, but is currently the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives. And Mr Leonard's critics had questioned whether he was capable of turning the party's fortunes around. Mr Leonard was seen as a close ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn In a statement, Mr Leonard said the decision to resign had not been easy - but he felt it was the right one for him and his party. He said: ""I have thought long and hard over the Christmas period about what this crisis means, and the approach Scottish Labour takes to help tackle it. ""I have also considered what the speculation about my leadership does to our ability to get Labour's message across. This has become a distraction. ""I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect."" He also insisted that Scotland now needs a Labour government more than ever, and accused both the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Leonard added: ""While I step down from the leadership today, the work goes on - and I will play my constructive part as an MSP in winning support for Labour's vision of a better future in a democratic economy and a socialist society."" His decision leaves Scottish Labour looking for its fifth leader since the independence referendum in 2014 - with Johann Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale all having held the job since then. A Procedures Committee, to oversee the election of Mr Leonard's successor, has been formed and will have its first meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, Labour's Scottish Executive Committee will also meet in the coming days to agree a timetable for the process. MSP Jackie Baillie, who was Scottish Labour's deputy leader, has taken charge of the party on an interim basis. This sudden resignation four months from the Holyrood elections seems to have taken Scottish Labour by surprise. MSPs I've spoken to said they did not see it coming. There have been times when Richard Leonard has been under severe pressure from some in his party to stand down. When several MSPs publicly called for him to quit because the party had gone backwards at successive elections on his watch, he stood firm. His critics seemed to have accepted that he would lead them and a divided party into the Holyrood election. That has now changed and interim leader Jackie Baillie has to quickly organise a contest to replace him. It's a contest in which Anas Sarwar, if he stands, would be an obvious frontrunner - even although he lost last time to Mr Leonard, who was seen as much closer to the then UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Leonard should be ""very proud"" of his achievements as leader of the party in Scotland. Sir Keir added: ""I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in. ""Richard has led Scottish Labour through one of the most challenging and difficult periods in our country's history, including a general election and the pandemic."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Leonard had been due to face a confidence vote at the party's ruling Executive Committee last September - but the motion was withdrawn at the last minute. It came after four Scottish Labour MSPs called for him to go, warning that the party faced ""catastrophe"" at the ballot box under his leadership. They pointed to the party's dismal performance in previous elections under Mr Leonard. Scottish Labour finished fifth in the European election in May 2019, and then lost all but one of its MPs in the general election in December of the same year. Mr Leonard insisted at the time that he intended to lead the party into this year's Holyrood election, and accused his opponents of waging ""internal war"" against him. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who faced Mr Leonard in her weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament, tweeted that she had ""always liked Richard Leonard"" despite their political difference. She added: ""He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future."" Ruth Davidson, who quit as leader of the Scottish Tories in 2019 before returning to lead the party at Holyrood, said she had always found Mr Leonard to be a ""thoroughly decent man and a committed campaigner."" Anas Sarwar, who was defeated by Mr Leonard in the leadership contest in 2017 and is seen as one of the favourites to replace him, said he was sure Mr Leonard would ""continue to fight for a fairer, more just and more equal society today, tomorrow and long into the future."" But Labour MSP Neil Findlay, an outspoken supporter of Mr Leonard, took aim at those who had sought to oust him last year - describing them as ""flinching cowards"" and ""sneering traitors"".

"Jamie McMillan said delays in exporting his shellfish would result in them arriving dead A Scottish shellfish firm has warned it is on the brink of bankruptcy as delays continue at ports following the introduction of post-Brexit red tape. Lochfyne Langoustines managing director Jamie McMillan said his firm had already lost some consignments after they were found to be rotten by the time they arrived in France. He also warned EU customers were now going to Denmark to buy langoustines. Mr McMillan described it as a ""very, very serious situation"". Small seafood firms face further export delays Seafood bodies call for 'lighter touch' on exports Scottish seafood exports 'held up by post-Brexit rules' His comments came after transport company DFDS announced a further delay in exports of group consignments of seafood to the EU. It halted groupage exports last weekafter delays in getting new paperworkfor EU border posts in France. DFDS said it would not resume those exports until Monday. Mr McMillan told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We've been screaming for the last six months - eight months - that we have to get our produce to market within 12 to 24 hours. ""Any delays in that process, our shellfish will arrive in France dead. ""We lost two pallets last week. It took five days to arrive in Boulogne from Scotland, so our goods were rotten on arrival."" Transport company DFDS has said it will not resume groupage exports until Monday He added: ""Customers are not buying from us any more - we have become unreliable suppliers. ""Everybody has stopped buying. This has happened for the past two weeks. We can't continue this to happen for another week because we will be out of business. ""We have had no sales to the EU, our biggest market for live shellfish, in the last two weeks. ""If we go another week without that, we are finished."" Mr McMillan said there were ""sticking points"" in both the UK and France, with transportation hubs in Scotland struggling with increased paperwork and checks by vets. ""There are sticking points down in France as well,"" he said. ""There are delays at the borders in France for up to 30 hours, I'm hearing, to clear customs by the time they do all their checks."" The UK government's Scotland Office minister David Duguid said he did not underestimate the struggles the industry was facing with paperwork, IT and ports. He said the UK and Scottish governments, fish exporters and the EU needed to come together to work through the issues, which he estimated would last ""weeks"" and not months. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""What I can commit to is that the UK government, whether that's through Defra or the Scotland Office, we are working day and night in resolving the issues that we know about and that we can fix directly. ""The other issues that are maybe the responsibility of the Scottish government, or indeed the EU on the other side of the channel, Defra are engaging heavily with those parties as well."" However, when asked directly on the programme how long the problems would last, Mr Duguid responded: ""How long is a piece of string?"" Fish ate up a lot of the time in negotiating the deal for departing the European customs union and single market. Now grown to become a much bigger political predator, it has started the post-Brexit era by threatening to devour UK ministers with the task of making the deal work. The fisheries minister admitted she was preparing for Christmas rather than seeing how the deal had turned out on 24 December. Asked how long it will take to sort out delays, a Scotland Office minister asked: ""How long's a piece of string?"" The prime minister says there will be compensation, but it seems that is due to come from the fund intended to expand the fishing fleet. And Michael Gove, who appears to have more of a grasp of the detail, was in the Commons on Wednesday, acknowledging there's a vast amount for the government yet to sort out - and that was only for Northern Ireland. At least the province got a grace period before consignments of food require the paperwork now needed to send fish to France. That was sought by fish and meat exporters. It's not clear if the request was made of EU negotiators, but it hasn't materialised. Yet coming the other way, the UK has given a six-month preparation period for EU exporters to Britain. Because seafood is freshly delivered, it is the product that hit the obstacles first. Meat and dairy are sure to follow. Beef exporters to Europe are beginning to face delays, while Brexit chickens are coming home to roast.

"The man demanded to know where the cats were kept, the court heard (File photo) A man accused of raiding a Melbourne animal shelter at gunpoint was trying to find his cat, a court has heard.

"Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 two weeks ago An elderly couple with coronavirus have been helped by a hospital to say their last goodbyes to each other after the wife's condition deteriorated. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell, Berkshire, are in separate wards at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey. Their daughter Chloe, who posted a picture of one reunion on Twitter, said her mother ""looked to be at the end"". She said her parents had ""precious"" extra time together thanks to the hospital's ""incredible"" efforts. Mrs Keljarrett said her 79-year-old father and mother, 76, who have been together for 50 years, were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 two weeks ago. On Tuesday she posted,external: ""In the midst of a pandemic peak, staff (namely a consultant, a surgeon and a HCA) at FPH just made sure my dad saw my mum for what is likely the last time."" She said another meeting happened on Wednesday when ""mum looked to be at the end"". Frimley Park Hospital said the reunions were the sort of ""care that matters the most"" She said: ""Dad was wheeled in, crying, touched her hand and her eyes flew open.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Donald Trump faces trial in the Senate after becoming the first US president to be charged with misconduct in office for a second time. Mr Trump is accused of inciting a mob that stormed Congress last week after he repeated false claims of election fraud. Five people died. The trial will be held after the president leaves office next Wednesday. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. The trial follows Wednesday's vote in the House of Representatives that formally charged - or impeached - the president with ""incitement of insurrection"" for his role in the riot. The Republican president has rejected responsibility for the violence. In a video released by the White House after the vote, he called on his supporters to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment. Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? 'Symbolic but necessaryâ: US voters react What happens to impeached presidents? The FBI has warned of possible armed protests plannedfor Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president. The Senate - the upper house of the US Congress - will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was ""simply no chance that a fair or serious trial"" could conclude given ""the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents"" that govern trials involving presidents. This video can not be played Trump: 'Violence and vandalism have no place in our country' A two-thirds majority will be needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. As many as 20 Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could then hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again, which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump was charged with inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?The House of Representatives has impeached him, moving the case to the Senate for a trial. But a trial will not be carried out before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January So what does it mean?A trial can happen after his term ends, and senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. He urged them to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard, but also to ""fight like hell"" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen. Following Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter while the building was placed on lockdown. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots The article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted"". It says he then repeated these claims and ""wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol"", leading to violence and loss of life. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government."" Donald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice. A year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration. Impeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead. The party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot Read more from Anthony For two hours, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote on impeachment while National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said: ""The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."" This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? Most Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity. ""Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. ""That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters."" Mr Trump was impeached by 232-197, with ten Republicans siding with Democrats. Among them was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney. With a sombre and conciliatory tone, Mr Trump said in his video after the vote: ""Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence."" Mr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the ""other urgent business of this nation"", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme.

"Global meteorological agencies agree that 2020 was a scorching year but they are divided on just where it ranks in the temperature records. For Nasa, last year is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the warmest year. Others, including the UK Met Office, believe it is second in the rankings dating back to the 19th Century. But all the agencies reporting on Thursday agree that last 12 months are part of the warmest decade on record. US emissions in 2020 in biggest fall since WWII Has coronavirus made us more ethical consumers? Call for massive expansion in vegetable growing Just last week,a report from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Serviceindicated that 2020 was tied with 2016 as the warmest year. Thursday's reports, from five key agencies around the world, show some dissent from this view, but all agree 2020 is in the top three. Wildfires raged in many parts of the world as temperatures soared Nasa says 2020 is tied with 2016, while the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa,external) and the UK Met Office have it second. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has 2020 as the third warmest year. The differences between the datasets are all within the margin of error, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which has consolidated the information from the agencies. The average global temperature across the year was around 14.9C, putting it around 1.2C above the average between 1850-1900 The 10 years from 2011-2020 were the warmest decade on record The warmest six years on record have all occurred since 2015 The differences between the top three, 2020, 2019 and 2016 are ""indistinguishably small"". Source: WMO Taken together they show the global temperature is now around 1.2C above the 1850-1900 average, sometimes referred to asthe ""pre-industrial figure"". Ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities are the key element in driving up temperatures, say researchers. While greenhouse gasesdeclined by around 7% globally last yearin response to the coronavirus shutdowns, this wasn't enough to affect temperatures. ""Because we haven't stopped doing that and, in fact, we continue to do that even with the pandemic, we're still putting our foot on the accelerator of climate change,"" Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York, told BBC News. ""We anticipate that the planet will continue to warm at the rate that it has and maybe even accelerate, unless we get those emissions down, and that's a big task."" By Jonathan Amos, Science Correspondent Every January we get a report on the surface temperature of Earth in the previous year. Or rather, we get several. Different leading agencies around the globe do their own particular analysis. Ignore the funny labels like HadCRUT5 by the UK Met Office or JRA-55 used by the Japan Meteorological Agency - what lies behind these names are some sophisticated statistical approaches. All the different temperature curves you see above are built on broadly the same raw data. This comes from millions of temperature measurements gathered by instruments on land and at sea (some ship-borne, some floating). What sets the individual analyses apart is the different ways the agencies go about handling quirks and biases in the data. For example, how do you incorporate the Arctic where we have relatively few measurements but where we know temperatures are rising faster than most other places? The different agencies have their own ways to extrapolate from nearby instrument stations to gauge what's going on in this region. It's best not to get hung up on the small differences between the curves. Look instead at the trend. On this they all absolutely agree 100%. Planet Earth is warming. One of the key concerns in the data from 2020 is the way that the warming driven by humans is over-compensating for natural events that help reduce temperatures. ""The exceptional heat of 2020 is despite a La NiÃ±a event, which has a temporary cooling effect,"" said WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas. ""It is remarkable that temperatures in 2020 were virtually on a par with 2016, when we saw one of the strongest El NiÃ±o warming events on record. This is a clear indication that the global signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as the force of nature."" The fact that 2020 saw global temperatures rising 1.2C above the pre-industrial figure is a growing concern. Under the Paris Agreement, governments have promised to make their best efforts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C this century, asscientists have shown it makes a massive differenceto keeping our planet habitable. In fact, if you just look at the temperatures on land, 2020 breached this limit. According to Noaa, the globally-averaged land surface temperature for 2020 was 1.59C above the 20th Century average. This is the highest among all years in Noaa's 141-year record and surpasses the previous record set in 2016 by 0.05C. In a record season for North Atlantic hurricanes, Iota caused considerable damage in Nicaragua ""2020 has proved to be another notable year in the global climate record,"" observed Dr Colin Morice, senior scientist in the Met Office's climate monitoring team. ""With all datasets showing a continued rise in global average temperature, the latest figures take the world one step closer to the limits stipulated by the Paris Agreement."" Another factor that helped drive up temperatures in 2020 was air pollution, or the lack of it. Global lockdowns meant fewer cars on the roads and airplanes in the sky. As the dirty air disappeared this allowed more sunlight to hit the Earth's surface, boosting temperatures. ""The cars that we drive produce a lot of what's called NOx, nitrogen oxides. And those went down pretty much everywhere, where we had restrictions,"" said Dr Schmidt. ""And what that has done is it has removed a little bit of that reflective air pollution. Our calculations and (those of) others suggest that that may have warmed the climate just a little bit over the last year.""

"Julia is doing well after her surprise arrival into the world A mother who gave birth just 10 days after discovering she was pregnant thought she had put on weight in lockdown. Samantha Hicks, from Portishead, North Somerset, attributed her baby Julia's kicking to sickness having been ill. Her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November . ""It never occurred to me I was pregnant as I had taken two previous tests which both came back negative,"" she said. When Mrs Hicks was taken to the Covid ward in hospital, doctors asked if she was pregnant and she said no. She said she had noticed a small amount of weight gain but put it down to lockdown and that she thought she might have  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) as it runs in the family. Mrs Hicks said: ""I felt a bit of movement but I thought it was because I had not been well. ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant."" Her husband Joe said: ""On Christmas Day, I asked her if she was sure she wasn't pregnant, but she said no and she knows her own body. ""Then on January 1, I had my hands on Sammy and we felt a baby kick. ""We took another pregnancy test which came back positive."" At that stage, Mrs Hicks thought she was only five or six months into her term and returned to her job in a care home, walking 40 minutes to get there. Julia was born weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg) Ten days later, her contractions began and Mr Hicks rushed her to hospital ""It was unreal, the doctors only realised Julia was full term when she was born,"" he said. The couple, who have two sons aged three and eight, said they had not planned on having more children. They have since been ""inundated"" with gifts from friends, family and strangers in Portishead, who have offered blankets and essentials to help out. ""We want to say thank you to everyone really,"" Mr Hicks said. Helen Blanchard, Director of Nursing and Quality at North Bristol NHS Trust said: ""We would like to pass our congratulations to Mrs Hicks and her family on their new arrival. ""As Mrs Hicks experienced when she was cared for at Southmead, it is routine practice to ask people if they are, or could be, pregnant upon admission. ""However, we would ask a patient to do a pregnancy test if they were undergoing specific operations or procedures.""

"The man demanded to know where the cats were kept, the court heard (File photo) A man accused of raiding a Melbourne animal shelter at gunpoint was trying to find his cat, a court has heard. Tony Wittman allegedly stormed the shelter on Monday in full camouflage gear and pointed an assault rifle at a female worker. Police say the victim and her colleagues are traumatised by the incident. Mr Wittman, 44, faces charges including kidnapping, false imprisonment, armed robbery and firearm offences. Police say he called the Lost Dogs' Home shelter on Monday but was told he would have to wait until the following morning to claim the lost cat. He allegedly went to the shelter later that day dressed in full camouflage and tied up a woman, demanding to know where the cats were kept. Australia to kill US pigeon that crossed Pacific Squirrels 'smuggled by plane to Australia' Mr Wittman allegedly told the woman: ""If you do as I say and listen to me, I won't shoot you."" Police say he told the female staffer to count to 100 before calling police. He then reportedly left the shelter and buried his clothes and weapons near his home. No animals were taken or harmed during the raid,according to local media,external. The court heard Mr Wittman returned to the shelter the next day to reclaim the animal. He was arrested later on Tuesday andadmitted to the raid, police say,external. He reportedly told police that the cat had on multiple occasions ""brought me back from the brink"". Detective Senior Constable Jo MacDonald told the court: ""On this occasion, he's acted to get back possession of a cat, which he was only going to be without for possibly 10 hours."" She said Mr Wittman had been in the army but was discharged for ""failing to render efficient service"". Mr Wittman's lawyer says he is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. You can read the full storyhere. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The German economy shrank by 5% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll, according to official figures. The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more. A team from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO)has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to begin its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Fabian Leendertz is a professor in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms at Germanyâs public health institute and will be working with the team in China. He toldBBC World Newsthat these steps are very positive. This video can not be played What is the starting point for WHOâs Wuhan Covid probe? The government says food over the February half term would be provided for children who usually get free school meals by local councils, under theCovid Winter Grant Scheme. But Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, says the government has ""shifted the goal posts"". He told Radio 4's PM that the governmentâs own guidance
on the Covid Winter Grant Scheme explicitly said it ""was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals"". ""The goalposts have just shifted on it, because we
were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Passengers will need to provide a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before departure Passengers arriving into NI from outside the UK and Republic of Ireland will soon have to produce a negative Covid-19 test before departure.

People arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days. The move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland. Passengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday. Negative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa. Speaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the ""very real"" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still ""no room for complacency"". She said she still believed there needed to be an ""two-island approach"" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a ""matter of urgency"". Mrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated. PSNI Chief Constable (centre) Simon Byrne attended Stormont's press briefing on Thursday with the first and deputy first ministers PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. He told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect ""firm and swift enforcement"". ""We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules."" On Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. There have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. Mrs Foster said she found it ""incredible and frankly unbelievable"" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. On Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising. Mr Swann said that meant more ""difficult decisions"" on lockdown restrictions could be required. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January. The first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required. Ministers have expressed concerns about keeping non-essential parts of businesses open Ministers have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers ""gaming"" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses. A meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon. Passengers can have Covid-19 test at airport Negative Covid test required for Ireland arrivals Elsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month. Dr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.

Mr Swann was asked if his department was ""putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket"". He said it was ""not the entirety of the answer"", adding: ""It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in. ""And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place. ""We may actually have to introduce more."" On Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination. She said that would be an ""incredible achievement"" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations. At present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations. PFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a ""difficult position"". The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers. ""I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,"" Mr Lindsay toldBBC Radio Foyle.

"This video can not be played Oxygen supplies 'under extreme pressure' A respiratory doctor at Belfast's Mater Hospital has warned that hospital oxygen supplies are under ""extreme pressure"". Dr Nick Magee also said more younger patients were now being treated in hospital than during the first and second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said in the past they did not have to consult other NI hospitals about how much oxygen they had. ""That was never a thing in previous January flu problems,"" he told the BBC. ""But that is something we are now having to think of,"" he added. Earlier this week Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there is enough oxygen to cope with the current demand. But according to Dr Magee the current level of oxygen being used in ""bays"" at the Mater means patients cannot charge their mobile phones by their bedside because of the ""fire risk"". ""It is all well controlled and we are making sure that we can share out that oxygen burden. That is something we are having to think about,"" he said. ""I can't say specifically about other regional hospitals but I know that they are under extreme pressure and it's just something we have to think of as a region. ""Can we supply oxygen adequately for the amounts of oxygen we are using in hospitals?"" Hospital's oxygen supply in 'critical' situation Concern over Derry hospital's oxygen supplies Covid tests for NI arrivals under consideration The number of Covid positive hospital in-patients has increased significantly since last week - up from 599 a week ago to 850 on Thursday. The number of people in ICU has also risen from 44 to 58 in the past week. Dr Magee said staff were concerned about having to cope with ""large volumes"" of patients requiring respiratory support. He said the number of younger patients becoming increasingly sick with the virus was growing. On Wednesday, the Mater Hospital moved six patients who had been on wards into ICU and also took patients from the Southern Health Trust. ""Recently I saw a 29-year-old patient, also three who were in their mid 30s that all required respiratory support on a ward,"" he told BBC News NI. ""They are frightened they are wearing specialist masks CPAP masks that help them breathe. They are scared."" The relentless pressure of the past 10 months and the prospect of a further surge in admissions over the next fortnight is weighing heavily on the minds of medics. ""We are really worried about next week,"" said Dr Magee. ""It's very busy this week, we are coping well but we are particularly concerned about next week. ""Normally, if we had somebody who needed a lot of respiratory support we would involve a high dependency unit but all the respiratory wards are becoming like high dependency units. ""Volume of sicker, younger patients is much greater and it's not something that I would [have] ever seen before,"" he added. The Southern Health and Social Care Trust said its hospitals had limited infrastructure to manage high numbers of patients requiring oxygen so a regional agreement was in place to share resources across Trusts to support Covid-positive patients. ""As a result some patients have been diverted to Belfast or SE Trust to help reduce pressure on the Southern Trust hospital system,"" a statement said. ""Craigavon and Daisy Hill hospitals remain very busy with high numbers of Covid-19 positive patients who are dependent on oxygen therapy. ""These protocols are in place as part of regional surge planning to ensure that we can safely manage the current high volume of Covid-19 patients needing hospital care. ""Patients who are currently being treated in Craigavon and Daisy Hill have secure supplies of oxygen.""

"Post-primary schools have been given extra time to decide how they will admit pupils in 2021 following the cancellation of transfer tests. On Wednesday the AQEsaid it would not hold any transfer tests in the 2020-21 school year. They had originally planned togo ahead with a test in late February after cancelling tests in January. The other test provider, PPTC, had also previously announced it would not hold tests this year. Attention will now focus especially on what criteria grammar schools will use to select pupils. Some have already published what criteriathey would use in the event transfer tests were cancelled but it is not clear if those will now change. All post-primaries were to submit their admissions criteria to the Education Authority (EA) by this Friday. But following the AQE's move the Department of Education (DE) has written to schools to tell them they do not have to provide criteria to the EA until Friday 22 January. ""This will allow them to meet the statutory deadline for publication on their website of 2 February 2021,"" the DE letter said. February AQE transfer test has been cancelled ""I would also remind you that boards of governors should ensure that any admissions criteria are robust and are able to clearly and objectively rank order applicants."" It is unclear how most grammar schools who have used transfer tests to select pupils in previous years will admit children in 2021. Patrick Allen, principal of Foyle College in Londonderry, said his school's board of governors was now working to determine this year's admissions criteria. ""This is and continues to be an exceptional year. It is a very difficult circumstance,"" he said. ""We are trying to do the best and what is right for as many pupils as possible in looking at various permutations and combinations of criteria"". Education Minister Peter Weir said it was ""a very disappointing day"" for many families. ""The transfer test, while it has never been about being compulsory for either a school or indeed an individual parent, does enable a level of parental choice and that has been dramatically reduced as a result of that,"" he told Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""But sadly what we have seen is for this year, the pandemic has prevented those transfer tests taking place, and I am very disappointed and entirely understand the disappointment and frustration of many families today."" Mr Weir said there had been ""a lack of consistency"" from AQE. ""I don't think the way things have worked out from AQE's point of view, particularly over the last couple of weeks, have been particularly helpful,"" he said. The education minister apologised for ""clumsy language"" The minister also apologised for ""clumsy language"" in a statement he issued on Wednesday night. Writing on Twitter about the cancellation of the transfer test, Mr Weir said: ""This severely limits parental choice and children's opportunities."" ""There was no adverse intention towards non-selective schools,"" he said in relation to his tweet. ""I think both selective and non-selective schools have got excellent records in Northern Ireland."" ""But once the opportunities for entry to any school is reduced then that is a reduction in opportunities for all."" UUP MLA Robbie Butler has proposed that pupils' results in tests in primary schools could be given to parents and then used by grammar schools to decide which children get a place. Mr Butler said that he had some favourable responses from some grammars and some primary schools to that proposal. ""Whilst I don't think my solution is absolutely perfect I do believe it to be absolutely fair and absolutely compassionate,"" he told MLAs on the committee. ""We have the genesis of a solution for these P7 pupils."" But, speaking on Wednesday, Mr Weir replied that there were issues with that approach. ""There are very major problems, I'm being honest with you, in terms of the models that have been put forward for academic selection without the test,"" he said. The minister said it would be difficult to get comparable information for pupils across all primaries. ""While it's not entirely ruling out those and there is the option for schools to do it, it does leave them in a very difficult position making comparability between pupils on a fair basis,"" he said February AQE transfer test has been cancelled Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Charlie Mullins said workers getting vaccinated is ""a no-brainer"". A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins said it was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business. The NHS is seeking to vaccinate 15 million people from priority groups by mid-February as part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. But Mr Mullins said he was prepared to pay for private immunisations for people at the firm, should they become available, which would be done on the company's time. Doctors have warned that key hospital services in England are in crisis, with reports of hospitals cancelling urgent operations after a surge in Covid patients in recent weeks. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Pimlico Plumbers plans to change its contracts for new joiners to require immunisation. It will rewrite its contracts with existing workers and employees as soon as is practical, depending on vaccine availability. The firm has about 350 plumbers working as contractors and about 120 employees. Mr Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" to have the jab. However, new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on, he said. Mr Mullins said employees approved of the policy. ""It's a no-brainer,"" he said. ""I've talked to people who have said: 'I will queue up all night to get the vaccine.' ""I think it will be the norm in five or six months. To go into a bar or cinema, or go on a plane, you have to have a vaccine,"" he added. Mr Mullins said he had set aside Â£800,000 to pay for private vaccinations, but estimated costs more in the region of Â£100,000. ""Whatever it costs, I will pay,"" he said. ""I would pay Â£1m tomorrow to safeguard our staff. ""If people don't want the vaccine, let them sit at home and not have a normal life,"" he added. However, employment lawyers said this vaccination policy could be risky. Legally, companies cannot force employees to take a vaccine, said Thrive Law managing director Jodie Hill. ""They can't jab a vaccine in your arm,"" she said. People who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim, she said. ""Even if they put that [requirement] in a new contract, I don't think they'd get away with it,"" she said. Employees with more than two years' service could claim unfair dismissal. But this option is not open to workers and self-employed contractors. Broadly, people can refuse a vaccination for legitimate reasons such as being pregnant or breastfeeding, for religious reasons, because of disability or allergy, or for ethical vegan reasons if the jab contains animal products. The two vaccines approved for use in the UK, from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech, do not contain any components of animal origin, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesman confirmed. Dismissal for employees with one or more of these protected characteristics could give rise to a discrimination claim. People who are hesitant about taking the vaccine for personal reasons would not be able to claim discrimination, but could potentially claim unfair dismissal if they have been with the firm for two years or more. People with strong anti-vaccination beliefs may be protected under equality law, Ms Hill added. The company and Mr Mullins have previously faced a lengthy legal battle with one of its former contractors, Gary Smith. In 2018,Mr Smith won a Supreme Court rulingover holiday and sick pay. However, an employment tribunal later ruled that he was not entitled to make a claim for the back pay, as he had not completed the necessary paperwork. Mr Mullins insisted that the vaccination change to contracts ""will be done legally"", but said that he was willing to take this matter to the Supreme Court as well, if necessary.

"Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. The NHS England figures cover Covid-19 vaccinations given to people at hospital hubs and GP practices between 8 December 2020 and 10 January 2021. Among the over-80s alone, most first doses - 204,140 - were administered in north-east England and Yorkshire, while the lowest number (92,398) were given to this age group in London. Overall, more than one-third of people aged 80 and over in England have received at least one dose. Concern over number of London Covid vaccinations High Street chemists start vaccinations in England Your vaccine questions answered Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? The figures show that in the Midlands more vaccine doses had been administered to all people in the top priority groups - 387,647 - than in any other area of England. In London, a total of 199,986 first doses were given and in the East the figure was 186,291. These include care home residents, frontline heath and care staff, the over-80s and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from the Covid-19. The percentage of the whole population to have received a first dose so far ranged from 4.3% in the north-east and Yorkshire to 2.2% in London. Mr Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" that Londoners had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country. ""The situation in London is critical with rates of the virus extremely high, which is why it's so important that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the vaccine as soon as possible,"" he said. He said he would hold talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi to ensure more vaccines were delivered to reflect the level of need in the city. London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said vaccinating over a third of all over-80s was ""a great achievement"". But she said people must continue to follow the guidance that is in place to protect themselves and their loved ones. ""These data will help us to evaluate the protection from the vaccine and to effectively target the roll-out of the programme to help control the virus and save lives,"" she added.

"The government has defended its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term - after criticism from teachers' unions and council leaders. Food will be provided for children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils say the government should provide food vouchers over half term. ""Vulnerable families will continue to receive meals,"" said a Department for Education (DFE) spokeswoman. ""Our guidance is clear: schools provide free school meals for eligible pupils during term time. ""Beyond that, there is wider government support in place to support families and children via the billions of pounds in welfare support we've made available,"" said the DFE spokeswoman. But the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, said ""the government should provide food vouchers to eligible families during February half-term as it did last summer"" - and that the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme should be used for other support. ""During the last full national lockdown, government recognised the significant extra pressures on low income families and extended free school meal provision into the school holidays,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board. ""Government was explicit that the Covid Winter Grant Scheme was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals, but was to enable councils to support low income households, particularly those at risk of food poverty as we moved towards economic recovery."" The row follows the DFE's publication ofguidelines on free meals,external, after an outcry over pictures of food packages to replace free school meals during the lockdown. The prime minister and other ministers criticised the quality of what was being sent out by some school food firms. Marcus Rashford has spear-headed a campaign for holiday food The DfE guidance says: ""Schools do not need to provide lunch parcels or vouchers during the February half term. ""There is wider government support in place to support families and children outside of term-time through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme."" The DFE insists that even though schools will not provide food parcels or vouchers during half term, children will still be supplied with food through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme. This aims to support those most in need with the cost of food, energy, water bills and other essentials. Councils are required to work out their own local approach to eligibility, using benefits data and their local knowledge to decide how to support vulnerable families. What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes Moving to this scheme for a replacement for school meals during half term, with the added pressure of a lockdown, has drawn criticism from head teachers and teachers. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned that switching schemes meant ""yet more disruption to free schools meals could lie ahead in half term"". He said using this scheme could cause an ""unnecessary logistical nightmare"", suggesting continuing with providing meals through schools would be more simple. Mr Courtney said: ""This week, Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson and Boris Johnson made public statements about how appalled they were by the quality of food parcels shared on Twitter,"" said Mr Courtney. But he said ministers should now ""hang their heads in shame"" for threatening more ""chaos and confusion"" over providing food. ""These are battles which should not have to be repeatedly fought,"" said Mr Courtney. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman accused the the government of ""badly thought out and last-minute schemes to help with holiday hunger"" which he said were ""leaving families and children anxious"". ""The government must urgently clarify for families how they will be helped during the upcoming half term holiday so they can be assured that they will not go hungry,"" said Mr Whiteman. Labour's Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""Time and time again this government has had to be shamed into providing food for hungry children over school holidays."" Food charities and anti-poverty campaigners, including footballer Marcus Rashford, have repeatedly clashed with the government over the issue of food for poor pupils during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly over school holidays. The footballer forced the government to back down in the summer over its plans not to offer free meals in the holidays to poor pupils, whose families were likely to be suffering with reduced incomes. But over the October half-term when the provision was withdrawn many local authorities continued to offer them from their own budgets. Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday?

"Siegfried and Roy were one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas Siegfried Fischbacher, one half of celebrated magic double act Siegfried and Roy, has died from pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas at the age of 81. The pair were among the biggest names in the world of magic and were known for working with lions and tigers. Paying tribute,David Copperfield called him,externala ""legend in magic"", andPenn Jillette said,externalSiegfried and Roy were ""pure showbiz and pure class"". Roy Horn died from Covid-19 complications last May. The pair ""invented the full length magic show headlining Vegas"", according to Jillette, who is known as part of the duo Penn and Teller.

Siegfried and Roy teamed up in their native Germany in the 1950s, and the highlight of their extravagant shows was their performances with white lions and white tigers. Horn was attacked by a 400lb white Bengal tiger named Montecore during a performance in Las Vegas in 2003, leaving him partially paralysed and using a wheelchair. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation and was later able to walk again, but the attack ended the duo's long-running Las Vegas residency. Roy Horn (left) had to use a wheelchair after the tiger attack Fischbacher and Horn, whose real name was Uwe Ludwig Horn, had met on a cruise ship and were later signed up by a liner company. After being spotted and signed to perform at a nightclub in Bremen, they went on to tour Europe and brought tigers into their act. But they shot to worldwide fame after launching their Las Vegas shows in the 1960s. Their unique brand of magic and artistry consistently attracted sell-out crowds. They performed an estimated 5,000 shows for 10 million fans in the city after 1990, when they began performing at the Mirage hotel-casino. They were also estimated to have grossed more than $1bn by 2001, which included their thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years. In 2004, their act became the basis for the animated comedy Father of the Pride, about the mischievous adventures of a family of white lions who perform with Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas. Horn's condition improved and by 2006 he was able to talk and walk with assistance from Fischbacher. In 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with a tiger (said to be Montecore, but this was disputed by some) at a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute in Las Vegas. Siegfried Fischbacher was devoted to his partner Roy They retired from showbusiness in 2010. After Horn's death last year, Fischbacher said: ""Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend. ""From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried."" Fischbacher recently had a 12-hour operation to remove a malignant tumour. He had been receiving care at home from two hospice workers in recent days.

"Charlie Mullins said workers getting vaccinated is ""a no-brainer"". A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins said it was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business. The NHS is seeking to vaccinate 15 million people from priority groups by mid-February as part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. But Mr Mullins said he was prepared to pay for private immunisations for people at the firm, should they become available, which would be done on the company's time. Doctors have warned that key hospital services in England are in crisis, with reports of hospitals cancelling urgent operations after a surge in Covid patients in recent weeks. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Pimlico Plumbers plans to change its contracts for new joiners to require immunisation. It will rewrite its contracts with existing workers and employees as soon as is practical, depending on vaccine availability. The firm has about 350 plumbers working as contractors and about 120 employees. Mr Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" to have the jab. However, new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on, he said. Mr Mullins said employees approved of the policy. ""It's a no-brainer,"" he said. ""I've talked to people who have said: 'I will queue up all night to get the vaccine.' ""I think it will be the norm in five or six months. To go into a bar or cinema, or go on a plane, you have to have a vaccine,"" he added. Mr Mullins said he had set aside Â£800,000 to pay for private vaccinations, but estimated costs more in the region of Â£100,000. ""Whatever it costs, I will pay,"" he said. ""I would pay Â£1m tomorrow to safeguard our staff. ""If people don't want the vaccine, let them sit at home and not have a normal life,"" he added. However, employment lawyers said this vaccination policy could be risky. Legally, companies cannot force employees to take a vaccine, said Thrive Law managing director Jodie Hill. ""They can't jab a vaccine in your arm,"" she said. People who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim, she said. ""Even if they put that [requirement] in a new contract, I don't think they'd get away with it,"" she said. Employees with more than two years' service could claim unfair dismissal. But this option is not open to workers and self-employed contractors. Broadly, people can refuse a vaccination for legitimate reasons such as being pregnant or breastfeeding, for religious reasons, because of disability or allergy, or for ethical vegan reasons if the jab contains animal products. The two vaccines approved for use in the UK, from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech, do not contain any components of animal origin, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesman confirmed. Dismissal for employees with one or more of these protected characteristics could give rise to a discrimination claim. People who are hesitant about taking the vaccine for personal reasons would not be able to claim discrimination, but could potentially claim unfair dismissal if they have been with the firm for two years or more. People with strong anti-vaccination beliefs may be protected under equality law, Ms Hill added. The company and Mr Mullins have previously faced a lengthy legal battle with one of its former contractors, Gary Smith. In 2018,Mr Smith won a Supreme Court rulingover holiday and sick pay. However, an employment tribunal later ruled that he was not entitled to make a claim for the back pay, as he had not completed the necessary paperwork. Mr Mullins insisted that the vaccination change to contracts ""will be done legally"", but said that he was willing to take this matter to the Supreme Court as well, if necessary.

"Primark stores have been hit hard by lockdown Primark says it has no plans to sell its clothes online despite warning that lockdown store closures could cost it more than Â£1bn in lost sales. Some 305 of Primark's 389 global stores are shut - including all 190 UK outlets - but unlike rivals it has no online arm to fall back on. Customers have said they would welcome the retailer setting up an online shop. But Primark, which saw a 30% sales fall to Â£2bn in the 16 weeks to 2 January, says the cost would mean price rises. It contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. On Thursday, consumers called on Primark to embrace e-commerce with one tweeting: ""Online sales are thru the roof during the pandemic. You're missing out on a LOT of money."" Where can you still use click-and-collect? Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' But the retailer tweeted back: ""We prefer to sell our products in our physical stores but thanks for the suggestion.""

Since March last year, non-essential shops in the UK and overseas have faced strict curbs and prolonged closures and all are currently shut in England. In a statement, Primark said,externalthat if all of its stores stayed closed until 27 February 2021, it expected to miss out on Â£1.05bn of sales - up from a previous estimate of Â£650m. The retailer said it would partially mitigate this by cutting its costs, but did not say if that would mean job losses. It added that it only expected to break even in the first half of the financial year, after seeing healthy operating profits of Â£441m last time around. In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. ""As a fast fashion retailer they are on a low margins anyway -  they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC. He said pure online players like Asos and Boohoo could make it work because they were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". Primark shops saw strong sales when they reopened after the first lockdown ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" Despite this Mr O'Brien said the retailer was still likely succeed, pointing to the surge in sales it saw when its shops reopened after the first lockdown. But Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. ""They have very loyal customers who love the brand, but they are crying out to be able to access it online. ""The longer they are not online, the more disruptive it is. The more their customers are discovering new brands and ways to shop."" Associated British Foods also owns food and agriculture businesses. Sales across the group were down 13% in the 16 weeks to 2 January at Â£4.8bn. There are always winners and losers in retail but this Christmas the picture is more polarised than ever thanks to the effects of the pandemic. Just contrast the fortunes of Primark, which doesn't sell online, with Boohoo and Asos which have both reported soaring growth in sales. All our big supermarkets have now reported bumper Christmas trading, too, which is no real surprise given we can't go out to eat and so many of us are working from home. This growth has also been driven by an extraordinary rise in internet orders. While Primark is bracing itself to lose Â£1bn in business as a result of store closures, Tesco says it added Â£1bn of extra sales online this festive quarter. It's been very tough for many traditional non-food retailers, big and small, who've been unable to make up for all the lost sales from their High Street shops. Looking ahead, the big question is where the online dial will settle when our lives eventually return to normal.

"The surge in Covid hospital cases has left key hospital services in England in crisis, doctors are warning. NHS data showed A&Es were facing rising delays admitting extremely sick patients on to wards. Meanwhile, the total number of people facing year-long waits for routine treatments is now more than 100 times higher than it was before the pandemic. Cancer experts are also warning the disruption to their services was ""terrifying"" and would cost lives. Reports have emerged of hospitals cancelling urgent operations - London's King's College Hospital has stopped priority two treatments, which are those that need to be done within 28 days. And Birmingham's major hospital trust has temporarily suspended most liver transplants. It comes after a surge in Covid patients in recent weeks. One in three patients in hospital have the virus - and at some sites it is more than half. NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the NHS was facing an ""exceptionally tough challenge"", adding services would continue to be under pressure until the virus was under control. But he stressed non-Covid treatment was still happening - with three times as many diagnostic tests and twice as many operations being carried out than in the spring when the pandemic first hit. Ambulance handover delays reach new winter peak NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid wave The data published by NHS England showed the scale of the impact from dealing with Covid on key hospital services. The data published on Thursday showed: Nearly 90,000 patients - one in four - admitted to hospital via A&E waited more than four hours for a bed to be found This included a record 3,745 who waited more than 12 hours There was a record 4.46 million on the waiting list for routine treatment, including knee and hip operations More than 192,000 have waited more than one year - in February, before the pandemic started, the figure stood at 1,600 Staff have had to be redeployed into critical care after rising Covid cases forced hospitals to increase the number of intensive care beds by a quarter since November The figures for cancer date back to November, before the surge in cases. At that point, the number of urgent cancer check-ups and treatments being started was at normal levels. But since then, concerns have been raised that services have been reduced. Prof Pat Price, of the Catch Up With Cancer campaign, said services were facing the ""biggest crisis"" of her 30-year career. ""This is a truly terrifying scenario,"" she added. And the Royal College of Surgeons warned the pandemic was having a ""calamitous impact"" on waiting times for planned surgery. Sarah Scobie, from the Nuffield Trust think tank, said services were under ""intolerable strain"", adding ""the worst is yet to come"". Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, agreed: ""The next few weeks are no doubt going to be the most testing in NHS history.""

"The Galaxy S21 Ultra has hardware built into it to make use of the firm's S Pen stylus Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S smartphone works with its stylus for the first time. The S Pen is an optional add-on for the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But the move will fuel speculation the firm will phase out its separate Note handset range. Samsung told the BBC it had yet to make a decision about this. The company's handset sales have declined more quickly than the wider market. One expert said a streamlined line-up might help address this. This video can not be played WATCH: First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra phone ""There's increasing logic for Samsung to converge the Galaxy S and Note platforms, because there's so little differentiation between the two kinds of devices now,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""That would align them with Apple, which also has one big phone launch event a year. ""My concern is that every time Samsung has announced its Note products in the past, it has planted a seed in consumers' minds that the Galaxy S products have become kind of the old ones."" The benefit of having a stylus is that it is easier to write, draw or annotate notes than using a finger. But to work it requires special hardware under the glass of the phone's display to pass power to the stylus and to track its tip. The Android-based Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8in (17.3cm) display, which is only slightly smaller than the top-end 6.9in Note. In years past, the Note phones were known as ""phablets"", and their size was the other key distinguishing factor with the S range. Unlike the Note series, the S21 Ultra requires a special case to stow away the pen Product manager Mark Notton said ""we haven't decided"", when asked whether Samsung planned to continue the Note family. ""It does not mean thatÂ SamsungÂ is not committed to the Note category, but is expanding the Note experience across device categories,""  the firm said in a follow-up statement. ""We will actively listen to consumers' feedback and reflect it in our continued product innovation."" The S21 Ultra will start at Â£1,149 when it goes on sale on 29 January. The S Pen costs an extra Â£35 on its own, or Â£85 when bundled with a case that stores it. That puts it in the ballpark of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's Â£1,179 starting price, which comes with a stylus that slots into its body. There are also two other lower-cost models in the new range, neither of which works with the S-Pen stylus: the 6.2in S21 and 6.7in S21+. All three models feature a redesigned camera module on their back. All the Galaxy S21 phones feature a redesigned camera module on their back But while the two lower-end models have three lenses - ultra-wide, wide and 3x-zoom telephoto - the S21 Ultra adds a further 10x-zoom telephoto lens, letting owners shoot action from even further away. The handsets also benefit from a new Director's View facility. It lets users film video while getting thumbnail previews superimposed on-screen of what it would look like if they switched to another lens. All three phones can film in 8K - double the maximum resolution of the competing iPhone 12 range's native video app. The Director's View mode lets users preview how the recorded shot will change in a video if they switch to a different lens while filming Other benefits over Apple's latest phones include: screens that can display up to 120 frames per second, to provide smoother visual effects wi-fi 6E wireless connectivity, allowing use of extra radio bandwith with a compatible router brighter screens - the S21 Ultra goes up to 1,500 nits, which should improve playback of HDR (high dynamic range) video However, the handsets may be more notable for following Apple in two regards. They have abandoned a slot for a microSD memory card. And they will be sold without either a charger - a decision over which Samsung hadmocked its rival.,external- or earphones. Samsung posted this ad in October on social media before deleting it ""We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have,"" the firm said. Samsung typically unveils its Galaxy range in late February, but has brought forward this year's launch to coincide with the CES tech show. ""SamsungÂ needs S21 to be a success given that S20 was launched in the middle of Covid first wave in Europe and didn't gain many fans,"" commented Marta Pinto, from research firm IDC. She added the earlier launch date could help it compete in the ""premium market"" with Apple, whose iPhones were released later than normal last year. The South Korean firm should also benefit from collapsing sales of Huawei's devices in the West, caused by US sanctions that prevent them offering the Google Play store and some of the search giant's other services. Samsung dedicated a segment of its Unpacked launch presentation to its partnership with Google But Mr Wood said Samsung was facing growing competition from other Chinese brands including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. ""Samsung's differentiator is going to be its ability to market its strong brand, and the fact it has a very wide product portfolio,"" he commented. Samsung also aims to widen its appeal with two further accessories. It has a new pair of Â£219 wireless earbuds that monitor what the user is doing. Samsung's earbuds should automatically adapt their audio output according to what the user is doing If they detect the wearer is talking, they automatically turn down the volume of music and amplify the sounds of the nearby environment picked up by their microphones, allowing the owner to have a brief conversation without needing to take them out or manually adjust their settings. Samsung also is launching the Â£30 Galaxy SmartTag - a Bluetooth-enabled tracker that can be attached to belongings or pets. It will allow an app to show their location, so long as the tag is in range of the owner or anyone else's compatible Samsung device. The tracker will compete with similar products from the current market leader Tile. The SmartTag will challenge Tile, which already sells a range of Bluetooth trackers Apple is widely rumoured to be working on similar devices of its own. First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra smartphone.

"Siegfried and Roy were one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas Siegfried Fischbacher, one half of celebrated magic double act Siegfried and Roy, has died from pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas at the age of 81. The pair were among the biggest names in the world of magic and were known for working with lions and tigers. Paying tribute,David Copperfield called him,externala ""legend in magic"", andPenn Jillette said,externalSiegfried and Roy were ""pure showbiz and pure class"". Roy Horn died from Covid-19 complications last May. The pair ""invented the full length magic show headlining Vegas"", according to Jillette, who is known as part of the duo Penn and Teller.

Siegfried and Roy teamed up in their native Germany in the 1950s, and the highlight of their extravagant shows was their performances with white lions and white tigers. Horn was attacked by a 400lb white Bengal tiger named Montecore during a performance in Las Vegas in 2003, leaving him partially paralysed and using a wheelchair. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation and was later able to walk again, but the attack ended the duo's long-running Las Vegas residency. Roy Horn (left) had to use a wheelchair after the tiger attack Fischbacher and Horn, whose real name was Uwe Ludwig Horn, had met on a cruise ship and were later signed up by a liner company. After being spotted and signed to perform at a nightclub in Bremen, they went on to tour Europe and brought tigers into their act. But they shot to worldwide fame after launching their Las Vegas shows in the 1960s. Their unique brand of magic and artistry consistently attracted sell-out crowds. They performed an estimated 5,000 shows for 10 million fans in the city after 1990, when they began performing at the Mirage hotel-casino. They were also estimated to have grossed more than $1bn by 2001, which included their thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years. In 2004, their act became the basis for the animated comedy Father of the Pride, about the mischievous adventures of a family of white lions who perform with Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas. Horn's condition improved and by 2006 he was able to talk and walk with assistance from Fischbacher. In 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with a tiger (said to be Montecore, but this was disputed by some) at a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute in Las Vegas. Siegfried Fischbacher was devoted to his partner Roy They retired from showbusiness in 2010. After Horn's death last year, Fischbacher said: ""Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend. ""From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried."" Fischbacher recently had a 12-hour operation to remove a malignant tumour. He had been receiving care at home from two hospice workers in recent days.

The rule will take effect on 9 January but there will be an exemption for British and Irish nationals. They will need to followexisting quarantine procedures.,external Aban by visitors to the UK from South Africastarted on 24 December. The latest restriction brought in by the Department for Transport also affects travellers arriving from Eswatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho and Mozambique. It will apply from 04:00 GMT on Saturday to people who have travelled from or through any of the specified countries in the last 10 days. It is understood most flights from the affected countries arrive at airports in England, although it is expected the policy will be formally adopted by the other UK nations. The measures will be in place for an initial period of two weeks. Meanwhile, Botswana, and the islands of Seychelles and Mauritius, are being removed from theUK list of safe travel corridors,externalas there is a high frequency of travel between the islands and South Africa. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk?

"The rapid spread of coronavirus variants has put the world on alert and triggered a new lockdown in the UK. What are these variants and why are they causing concern? All viruses naturally mutate over time, and Sars-CoV-2 is no exception. Since the virus was first identified a year ago, thousands of mutations have arisen. The vast majority of mutations are ""passengers"" and will have little impact, says Dr Lucy van Dorp, an expert in the evolution of pathogens at University College London. ""They don't change the behaviour of the virus, they are just carried along."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Are mutations making coronavirus more infectious? But every once in a while, a virus strikes lucky by mutating in a way that helps it survive and reproduce. ""Viruses carrying these mutations can then increase in frequency due to natural selection, given the right epidemiological settings,"" Dr van Dorp says. This is what seems to be happening with the variant that has spread across the UK, known as 202012/01, and a similar, but different variant, recently identified in South Africa (501.V2). Hundreds of thousands of viral genomes have been analysed across the world There is no evidence so far that either causes more severe disease, but the worry is that health systems will be overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases. In a rapid risk assessment of these ""variants of concern"",,externalthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said they place increased pressure on health systems. ""Although there is no information that infections with these strains are more severe, due to increased transmissibility, the impact of Covid-19 disease in terms of hospitalisations and deaths is assessed as high, particularly for those in older age groups or with co-morbidities,"" the EU agency said. The variants have different origins but share a mutation in a gene that encodes the spike protein, which the virus uses to latch on to and enter human cells. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? UK has two cases of variant found in South Africa Scientists think this could be why they appear more infectious. ""The UK and South African virus variants have changes in the spike gene consistent with the possibility that they are more infectious,"" says Prof Lawrence Young at the University of Warwick. But as Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, points out, it's the combination of what the virus is doing and what we're doing that determines how fast it spreads. ""With the new variant, the situation changes more quickly as restrictions are relaxed and tightened, and there is less room for error in controlling the spread,"" he says. ""We don't have any evidence, however, that the new variant can fundamentally evade masks, social distancing, or the other interventions - we just need to apply them more strictly."" The spike protein (foreground) enables the virus to enter and infect human cells With vaccine roll-out underway, scientists are racing to understand the repercussions for vaccines, which are based on the spike protein sequence. There is particular concern about the South Africa variant, which has several changes in the spike (S) protein. Most experts think vaccines will still be effective, at least in the short term. Dr Julian W Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, says vaccines can be modified to be ""more close-fitting and effective against this variant in a few months"". ""Meanwhile, most of us believe that the existing vaccines are likely to work to some extent to reduce infection/ transmission rates and severe disease against both the UK and South African variants - as the various mutations have not altered the S protein shape that the current vaccine-induced antibodies will not bind at all."" Mink outbreaks are a ""spillover"" from the human pandemic Scientists are carrying out laboratory studies to find out more about the variants. And they are tracking every move of the virus as it hopscotches around the world. By taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the virus can be extracted and amplified before being ""read"" using a sequencer. The string of letters, or nucleotides, allows genomes and mutations to be compared. ""It is thanks to these efforts, and UK testing laboratories, that the UK variant has been flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern,"" Dr van Dorp says. Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, says that, through the efforts of scientists to sequence the virus, ""we've got a really good handle on variants that emerge"". In the short-term, only the harshest of lockdowns will reduce case numbers, he says. ""What lockdown does is reduce the number of people with the virus and reduce the amount of virus out there and that's a good thing."" But in the long term, Prof Hiscox suspects, we may face a scenario like flu, where new vaccines are developed and administered every year. ""The problem is, the more variants we get, the greater the chance the virus will be able to escape part of the vaccine - and this may reduce [its] efficacy,"" he says.

"The coronavirus growth rate is slowing in the UK and the number of infections is starting to level off in some areas, a top scientist has said. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a ""sign of plateauing"" in cases and hospital admissions. But he warned the overall death toll would exceed 100,000. On Wednesday, the UK sawits biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths. It has taken the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. There were also 47,525 new cases. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thenational lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"", but it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules. People in England are required to stay at homeand only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""much too early"" to say when the number of cases would come down. Patel: No new Covid rules 'today or tomorrow' Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Pharmacies in England start Covid vaccination Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge But he said: ""It looks like in London in particular and a couple of other regions in the South East and East of England, hospital admissions may even have plateaued. ""It has to be said this is not seen everywhere - both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas, but overall at a national level we are seeing the rate of growth slow."" Prof Ferguson added: ""I would hope the hospital admissions might plateauâ¦ sometime in the next week, but hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks."" He warned the overall death toll would be ""well over 100,000"", adding ""there's nothing we can do about that now"". Prof Ferguson added Covid restrictions could be in place for many months to come, adding the new variant's increased transmissibility would mean relaxation of the rules will be a ""gradual process to the autumn"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Thursday that the government will not be introducing tougher social distancing rules ""today or tomorrow"" and insisted that ministers are focusing on increasing enforcement of the current restrictions. Asked about speculation further measures could include a three-metre social distancing rule or a requirement to wear masks outside, she told ITV's This Morning: ""This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures."" Meanwhile, a major study led by Public Health England has shownmost people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the finding ""doesn't eliminate"" the risk of people catching Covid-19 again, and infecting others. She said: ""We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals."" Prof Hopkins said she hoped that after Easter, ""we will start to see reduced infection rates, as we did at that time last year"" and the number of people who have been vaccinated at a ""very high level"". The UK is continuing efforts to ramp up the rollout of the Covid vaccine, with the prime minister saying thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted on Thursday,externalto say that ""three million vaccines have now been administered"" in the UK. On Thursday, NHS England publisheda breakdown of vaccinations by age and region,externalfor the first time. Mr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesdaythat he was ""concerned"" about a new Covid variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil and said that the UK was taking steps to ensure it is not brought into the UK. A Downing Street spokesman said ministers met this morning to discuss ""urgent measures to reduce the potential spread to the UK of the Brazilian variant"". They could includea ban on flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, the Deputy Scottish First Minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast ""the virus is not accelerating as fast as it was"" in Scotland. He said ""there are some early signs of optimism"" but emphasised people should follow all guidance as the ""virus is still at a very strong level"".

"Two new fast-spreading subvariants of Omicron are causing fresh surges of Covid around the world. BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave. They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe. They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants. Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too. Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit. BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall. But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily. This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths. As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Extra Covid booster in spring for over-75s and high risk How many people have been vaccinated so far? Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested. Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. How many people have had boosters so far?

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason A ban on travellers to the UK from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde will begin on Friday due to a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules would come in from 04:00 GMT. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. On Thursday the UK reported a further 1,248 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The previous day had seen a record figure of 1,564.There were also another 48,682 daily Covid cases. The number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,918,252 - up by 278,943 from Wednesday. How worrying are the new Covid variants? New test rule for England arrivals pushed back Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? The new travel ban,externalapplies to people who have travelled from, or through, the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. Portugal, including the islands of Madeira and the Azores, is also banned, along with the central American nation of Panama and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. Mr Shapps said he ""can't provide an end date"" to the new rules. He said the current restrictions on global travel meant he didn't ""expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America and we're not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result"". Portugal had been included ""given its strong travel links with Brazil"", he said, but added that there would be an exemption for hauliers travelling from the country to allow the transportation of essential goods. He said suspending travel from that European country would act ""as another way to reduce the risk of importing infections"". Qatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba have also been removed from the UK's travel corridor lists, meaning anyone arriving from these countries after 04:00 GMT on Saturday will have to quarantine for 10 days. Jon Dent, 31, from Wolverhampton, travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could see their daughter Luiza, one, for the first time. They are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very concerned"" about the Brazilian variant of the virus. New variants of Covid-19 have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Several Central and South American nations had already restricted travel from the UK, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, while others such as Argentina and Uruguay have closed their borders to non-resident foreign nationals. The Department for Transport said under the ban no exemptions would apply, including those for employment, and people who live with someone who has travelled from one of the banned countries will have to self-isolate for 10 days. BBC News online health editor Michelle Roberts said there wasno sign that any of the new variants were more dangerous, with scientists confident that vaccines would work against them. Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said the new variant was ""of concern"" and its origin was ""undoubtedly"" from the Amazon region. He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern,"" he said, adding: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve."" By Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter, News Online Latin America editor Brazil has recorded the second highest number of Covid deaths in the world The Covid pandemic may have arrived in South America later than in Europe but it did so with a vengeance. In May, the World Health Organization warned that it had become the new epicentre of the pandemic with Brazil soon joining the top three countries with the most confirmed cases. But the travel ban is not about numbers; some of the countries on the list have had relatively few Covid cases, like Guyana with fewer than 7,000. This is about the new strain and how it could spread quickly through travel in the region. Brazil borders 10 countries and cross-border business is brisk. Panama, also on the list even though it is further to the north, is a major travel hub for flights from South America to Europe and the US. And tourism has not stopped either. On 25 December, Brazil suspended all flights from the UK over the new UK strain, but air travel from other countries continued, especially over Christmas - the main holiday season in the southern hemisphere. The travel ban comes after it was announced arequirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journeywill now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. The Scottish government said the delay meant it would also wait until Monday. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days. Mr Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday to allow British nationals to be able to get home, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people would be ""bewildered"" by the delay and would ""feel that we're exposed"".

Meanwhile, Covid-19 case rates have fallen in most regions of England, according to the latest data from Public Health England's weekly surveillance report. London continues to have the highest rate of any region but its rate of new cases stood at 864.9 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 January, down from 1,043.9 in the previous week. The North East, East Midlands, East, South East and Yorkshire & the Humber also recorded a week-on-week fall. However, the rate increased in the North West, South West and the West Midlands.

"The home secretary has said the government will not announce new Covid restrictions on Thursday or Friday, but did not rule out further measures being announced next week. Priti Patel told ITV her focus was on enforcing the current lockdown rules. It is thought ministers are considering measures like requiring masks outside or allowing people to exercise only with people from the same household. On Wednesday,the UK recorded 1,564 new deaths,the highest daily total so far. Mrs Patel emphasised the current stay-at-home rules, under which people are only allowed to go out for a limited number of reasons, including work, essential shopping and providing care to a vulnerable person. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Infections levelling off in some areas - scientist Asked whether further restrictions could include a three-metre social distancing rule, or the requirement to wear masks outside, the home secretary told ITV's This Morning: ""The plans are very much to enforce the rules. ""This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures."" But Ms Patel did not rule out new measures being announced next week, saying: ""We are not thinking about bringing in new measures today or tomorrow."" At a press conference on Monday,she said police would move more quickly to fine people who break the rules. Over the course of the pandemic, more than 30,000 such fines have been issued. A senior backbench Conservative MP has written to his colleagues to criticise the government's approach to coronavirus restrictions. Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, which is sceptical of lockdown measures, said that if the government did not change its strategy, ""inevitably the prime minister's leadership will be on the table: we strongly do not want that after all we have been through as a country"". He asked his colleagues to impress upon the party's chief whip the need for ""a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter"". However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why the current lockdown restrictions are ""weaker"" than those imposed in March last year, when deaths and hospitalisations were lower than they are now. He questioned why nurseries were open when primary schools were closed, and whether estate agents should be allowed to continue with house viewings. Rules have been further tightened in Scotland this week, withnew restrictions on click and collect and takeaway services. And in Wales, people areonly allowed to exercise outdoors with members of their household or support bubble., while inNorthern Ireland the rule of six still applies to meetings of people outdoors.

"Armie Hammer has starred in The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name US actor Armie Hammer has pulled out of a new film with Jennifer Lopez after what he described as ""vicious and spurious online attacks against me"". Hammer had been set to appear in the action comedy Shotgun Wedding. However, the star's role will now be re-cast after private messages he supposedly sent were circulated online. In a statement, Hammer dismissed the messages and said the subsequent abuse meant he could no longer spend months away from his children while filming. ""I'm not responding to these [false] claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic,"" the 34-year-old said, according toDeadline,externalandVariety,external. The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name actor added that film studio Lionsgate ""is supporting me in this and I'm grateful to them for that"". Hammer has two children aged six and three with TV host Elizabeth Chambers. The couple announced their divorce last summer.

"Travel from Brazil to the UK could be banned in response to the discovery of a new coronavirus variant. Ministers have met to discuss possible measures and a block on flights could also be extended to other South American countries in a bid to stop its spread. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""concerned"" about the new variant and ""extra measures"" were being taken. Arrivals from Brazil are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove chaired a meeting earlier to discuss whether measures should be put in place. New variants of Covid-19 have also been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa. Coronavirus variants: The science explained Infections levelling off in some areas - scientist Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' During a two-hour appearance in front of the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday Mr Johnson stopped short of promising a ban on travel from Brazil. ""We already have tough measures ... to protect this country from new infections coming in from abroad,"" he said. ""We are taking steps to do that in respect of the Brazilian variant."" This video can not be played Johnson: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see the import of this new variant"". Prof Susan Hopkins, who is Strategic Response Director for Covid-19 with Public Health England, told BBC Breakfast experts were looking at the Brazilian variant and needed to grow the virus in the UK in order to perform laboratory experiments. ""So we need to understand the biology of these [new strains], as well as understanding mutations,"" she said. ""We will be watching them all to make sure that they can't escape your immune response, which is the key thing that we're looking at the moment."" A travel ban was put in place on arrivals from South Africa on 24 December, which was later extended toseveral other nearby countries, following the discovery of a new variant. Luiz Amorim, a graphic designer in London, said he had travelled to Brazil to spend Christmas with his family and was now worried he may not be able to get home. ""My wife was also supposed to come but didn't in the end,"" he said. ""Now I am worried I won't be able to get back to her in London."" Mr Amorim said his workplace had been supportive but he may have to take leave if he was unable to return, with his original flight back having been cancelled.

"The Galaxy S21 Ultra has hardware built into it to make use of the firm's S Pen stylus Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S smartphone works with its stylus for the first time. The S Pen is an optional add-on for the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But the move will fuel speculation the firm will phase out its separate Note handset range. Samsung told the BBC it had yet to make a decision about this. The company's handset sales have declined more quickly than the wider market. One expert said a streamlined line-up might help address this. This video can not be played WATCH: First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra phone ""There's increasing logic for Samsung to converge the Galaxy S and Note platforms, because there's so little differentiation between the two kinds of devices now,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""That would align them with Apple, which also has one big phone launch event a year. ""My concern is that every time Samsung has announced its Note products in the past, it has planted a seed in consumers' minds that the Galaxy S products have become kind of the old ones."" The benefit of having a stylus is that it is easier to write, draw or annotate notes than using a finger. But to work it requires special hardware under the glass of the phone's display to pass power to the stylus and to track its tip. The Android-based Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8in (17.3cm) display, which is only slightly smaller than the top-end 6.9in Note. In years past, the Note phones were known as ""phablets"", and their size was the other key distinguishing factor with the S range. Unlike the Note series, the S21 Ultra requires a special case to stow away the pen Product manager Mark Notton said ""we haven't decided"", when asked whether Samsung planned to continue the Note family. ""It does not mean thatÂ SamsungÂ is not committed to the Note category, but is expanding the Note experience across device categories,""  the firm said in a follow-up statement. ""We will actively listen to consumers' feedback and reflect it in our continued product innovation."" The S21 Ultra will start at Â£1,149 when it goes on sale on 29 January. The S Pen costs an extra Â£35 on its own, or Â£85 when bundled with a case that stores it. That puts it in the ballpark of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's Â£1,179 starting price, which comes with a stylus that slots into its body. There are also two other lower-cost models in the new range, neither of which works with the S-Pen stylus: the 6.2in S21 and 6.7in S21+. All three models feature a redesigned camera module on their back. All the Galaxy S21 phones feature a redesigned camera module on their back But while the two lower-end models have three lenses - ultra-wide, wide and 3x-zoom telephoto - the S21 Ultra adds a further 10x-zoom telephoto lens, letting owners shoot action from even further away. The handsets also benefit from a new Director's View facility. It lets users film video while getting thumbnail previews superimposed on-screen of what it would look like if they switched to another lens. All three phones can film in 8K - double the maximum resolution of the competing iPhone 12 range's native video app. The Director's View mode lets users preview how the recorded shot will change in a video if they switch to a different lens while filming Other benefits over Apple's latest phones include: screens that can display up to 120 frames per second, to provide smoother visual effects wi-fi 6E wireless connectivity, allowing use of extra radio bandwith with a compatible router brighter screens - the S21 Ultra goes up to 1,500 nits, which should improve playback of HDR (high dynamic range) video However, the handsets may be more notable for following Apple in two regards. They have abandoned a slot for a microSD memory card. And they will be sold without either a charger - a decision over which Samsung hadmocked its rival.,external- or earphones. Samsung posted this ad in October on social media before deleting it ""We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have,"" the firm said. Samsung typically unveils its Galaxy range in late February, but has brought forward this year's launch to coincide with the CES tech show. ""SamsungÂ needs S21 to be a success given that S20 was launched in the middle of Covid first wave in Europe and didn't gain many fans,"" commented Marta Pinto, from research firm IDC. She added the earlier launch date could help it compete in the ""premium market"" with Apple, whose iPhones were released later than normal last year. The South Korean firm should also benefit from collapsing sales of Huawei's devices in the West, caused by US sanctions that prevent them offering the Google Play store and some of the search giant's other services. Samsung dedicated a segment of its Unpacked launch presentation to its partnership with Google But Mr Wood said Samsung was facing growing competition from other Chinese brands including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. ""Samsung's differentiator is going to be its ability to market its strong brand, and the fact it has a very wide product portfolio,"" he commented. Samsung also aims to widen its appeal with two further accessories. It has a new pair of Â£219 wireless earbuds that monitor what the user is doing. Samsung's earbuds should automatically adapt their audio output according to what the user is doing If they detect the wearer is talking, they automatically turn down the volume of music and amplify the sounds of the nearby environment picked up by their microphones, allowing the owner to have a brief conversation without needing to take them out or manually adjust their settings. Samsung also is launching the Â£30 Galaxy SmartTag - a Bluetooth-enabled tracker that can be attached to belongings or pets. It will allow an app to show their location, so long as the tag is in range of the owner or anyone else's compatible Samsung device. The tracker will compete with similar products from the current market leader Tile. The SmartTag will challenge Tile, which already sells a range of Bluetooth trackers Apple is widely rumoured to be working on similar devices of its own. First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra smartphone.

"Armie Hammer has starred in The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name US actor Armie Hammer has pulled out of a new film with Jennifer Lopez after what he described as ""vicious and spurious online attacks against me"". Hammer had been set to appear in the action comedy Shotgun Wedding. However, the star's role will now be re-cast after private messages he supposedly sent were circulated online. In a statement, Hammer dismissed the messages and said the subsequent abuse meant he could no longer spend months away from his children while filming. ""I'm not responding to these [false] claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic,"" the 34-year-old said, according toDeadline,externalandVariety,external. The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name actor added that film studio Lionsgate ""is supporting me in this and I'm grateful to them for that"". Hammer has two children aged six and three with TV host Elizabeth Chambers. The couple announced their divorce last summer. His name began trending over the weekend after explicit messages detailing disturbing sexual fantasies, which were purportedly sent by him, appeared online. A spokesman for Shotgun Wedding told the PA news agency that the film's producers accepted his decision. ""Given the imminent start date of Shotgun Wedding, Armie has requested to step away from the film and we support him in his decision,"" they said. Hammer played the Winklevoss twins in 2010's The Social Network and starred opposite TimothÃ©e Chalamet in 2017's acclaimed drama Call Me By Your Name.

"Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. The NHS England figures cover Covid-19 vaccinations given to people at hospital hubs and GP practices between 8 December 2020 and 10 January 2021. Among the over-80s alone, most first doses - 204,140 - were administered in north-east England and Yorkshire, while the lowest number (92,398) were given to this age group in London. Overall, more than one-third of people aged 80 and over in England have received at least one dose. Concern over number of London Covid vaccinations High Street chemists start vaccinations in England Your vaccine questions answered Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? The figures show that in the Midlands more vaccine doses had been administered to all people in the top priority groups - 387,647 - than in any other area of England. In London, a total of 199,986 first doses were given and in the East the figure was 186,291. These include care home residents, frontline heath and care staff, the over-80s and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from the Covid-19. The percentage of the whole population to have received a first dose so far ranged from 4.3% in the north-east and Yorkshire to 2.2% in London. Mr Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" that Londoners had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country. ""The situation in London is critical with rates of the virus extremely high, which is why it's so important that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the vaccine as soon as possible,"" he said. He said he would hold talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi to ensure more vaccines were delivered to reflect the level of need in the city. London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said vaccinating over a third of all over-80s was ""a great achievement"". But she said people must continue to follow the guidance that is in place to protect themselves and their loved ones. ""These data will help us to evaluate the protection from the vaccine and to effectively target the roll-out of the programme to help control the virus and save lives,"" she added.

"Travel from Brazil to the UK could be banned in response to the discovery of a new coronavirus variant. Ministers have met to discuss possible measures and a block on flights could also be extended to other South American countries in a bid to stop its spread. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""concerned"" about the new variant and ""extra measures"" were being taken. Arrivals from Brazil are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove chaired a meeting earlier to discuss whether measures should be put in place. New variants of Covid-19 have also been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa. Coronavirus variants: The science explained Infections levelling off in some areas - scientist Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' During a two-hour appearance in front of the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday Mr Johnson stopped short of promising a ban on travel from Brazil. ""We already have tough measures ... to protect this country from new infections coming in from abroad,"" he said. ""We are taking steps to do that in respect of the Brazilian variant."" This video can not be played Johnson: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see the import of this new variant"". Prof Susan Hopkins, who is Strategic Response Director for Covid-19 with Public Health England, told BBC Breakfast experts were looking at the Brazilian variant and needed to grow the virus in the UK in order to perform laboratory experiments. ""So we need to understand the biology of these [new strains], as well as understanding mutations,"" she said. ""We will be watching them all to make sure that they can't escape your immune response, which is the key thing that we're looking at the moment."" A travel ban was put in place on arrivals from South Africa on 24 December, which was later extended toseveral other nearby countries, following the discovery of a new variant. Luiz Amorim, a graphic designer in London, said he had travelled to Brazil to spend Christmas with his family and was now worried he may not be able to get home. ""My wife was also supposed to come but didn't in the end,"" he said. ""Now I am worried I won't be able to get back to her in London."" Mr Amorim said his workplace had been supportive but he may have to take leave if he was unable to return, with his original flight back having been cancelled. He has now booked another flight on 27 January and is ""watching the news closely to see what will happen"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The discussion comes after it was announced arequirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journeywill now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday ""to give international arrivals time to prepare"". Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, described the delay in introducing the new rules as ""truly shocking"". Scotland is taking the same approach to international travellers but will implement the policy on Friday, while Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government for delaying pre-departure testing for arrivals to England, describing the situation as a ""complete mess"". ""Priti Patel has talked tough about the borders but other countries have been doing testing for months and months,"" he said. Sir Keir said people were ""really worried"" about strains in other parts of the world, including Brazil, and people would be ""bewildered and they will feel that we're exposed"".

"This video can not be played James Howells says he wishes he had never thrown away the hard drive A man who threw away a laptop hard drive containing bitcoin he believes is now worth about Â£210m wants his council to let him search for it in landfill. James Howells had 8,000bitcoins, a virtual currency, on the hard drive,which he mistakenly threw away in 2013. He said he was willing to donate 25% of the value of the bitcoins to his home city of Newport in south Wales - about Â£52.5m - if he found the hard drive. Newport council said excavation was not possible under its licensing permit. Mr Howells said if he was to recover the hard drive, he would want the money to be put into a ""Covid relief fund"" for people in Newport to use ""no questions asked"". What is bitcoin? Man has two guesses to unlock bitcoin fortune PayPal allows bitcoin and crypto spending ""Imagine how great it would be to say 'I've given everyone in the city a few hundred pounds',"" he told the BBC. Mr Howells bought the bitcoins for almost nothing in 2009, but the hard drive ended up in a drawer after he spilled a drink on his laptop. He kept the hard drive in his office drawer and ""totally forgot about bitcoin all together"" - so when he had a clear out, he believed everything had been taken off it. When he threw the hard drive away in 2013, the value of the bitcoins was about $7.5m (Â£4.6m). But now they are worth almost 50 times more, with the cost of a single bitcoin currently just over Â£28,000 after a surge in value. This video can not be played James Howells: ""When I went up to the landfill site yesterday my first thought was 'I've got not chance'"" He said he has asked Newport council if he could search the landfill several times, but had not been granted permission. ""I offered the local authority 10% of the recovered funds in order to give me permission to search on their property and unfortunately they said no at the time,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""What actually happened after that was the value of bitcoin skyrocketed even further. In 2017 the value of my hard drive was approximately Â£125m, at which point I made them another offer of 10% and unfortunately that offer was refused as well. James Howells said he wants to donate a quarter of the money to the people of Newport ""I haven't actually made an offer to them today, but I'm willing to increase my offer to them to 25%. On today's valuation that would be Â£52.5m and I'd like to put that into a Covid relief fund for the citizens of Newport."" Mr Howells said searching for the discarded hard drive would ""not be as hard as you might think"" as he would employ a professional team - and knows when he threw it away so could use that to find a grid reference of where the hard drive is buried. He added investors had offered to cover the cost of excavating the landfill, in exchange for a large proportion of the recovered bitcoin. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Mr Howells said he wants to meet with the council to discuss what he said would be a ""win-win-win"" situation for him, the council and the city. But a spokeswoman for the council said: ""Newport City Council has been contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins. ""The first time was several months after Mr Howells first realised the hardware was missing. ""The council has told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licencing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area. ""The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds - without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order."" This story was updated on 9 January 2025 to clarify that Mr Howells had 8,000 bitcoins rather than 7,500 as we previously reported.

"Primark stores have been hit hard by lockdown Primark says it has no plans to sell its clothes online despite warning that lockdown store closures could cost it more than Â£1bn in lost sales. Some 305 of Primark's 389 global stores are shut - including all 190 UK outlets - but unlike rivals it has no online arm to fall back on. Customers have said they would welcome the retailer setting up an online shop. But Primark, which saw a 30% sales fall to Â£2bn in the 16 weeks to 2 January, says the cost would mean price rises. It contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. On Thursday, consumers called on Primark to embrace e-commerce with one tweeting: ""Online sales are thru the roof during the pandemic. You're missing out on a LOT of money."" Where can you still use click-and-collect? Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' 'Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' But the retailer tweeted back: ""We prefer to sell our products in our physical stores but thanks for the suggestion.""

Since March last year, non-essential shops in the UK and overseas have faced strict curbs and prolonged closures and all are currently shut in England. In a statement, Primark said,externalthat if all of its stores stayed closed until 27 February 2021, it expected to miss out on Â£1.05bn of sales - up from a previous estimate of Â£650m. The retailer said it would partially mitigate this by cutting its costs, but did not say if that would mean job losses. It added that it only expected to break even in the first half of the financial year, after seeing healthy operating profits of Â£441m last time around. In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. ""As a fast fashion retailer they are on a low margins anyway -  they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC. He said pure online players like Asos and Boohoo could make it work because they were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". Primark shops saw strong sales when they reopened after the first lockdown ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" Despite this Mr O'Brien said the retailer was still likely succeed, pointing to the surge in sales it saw when its shops reopened after the first lockdown. But Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. ""They have very loyal customers who love the brand, but they are crying out to be able to access it online. ""The longer they are not online, the more disruptive it is.

All our big supermarkets have now reported bumper Christmas trading, too, which is no real surprise given we can't go out to eat and so many of us are working from home. This growth has also been driven by an extraordinary rise in internet orders. While Primark is bracing itself to lose Â£1bn in business as a result of store closures, Tesco says it added Â£1bn of extra sales online this festive quarter. It's been very tough for many traditional non-food retailers, big and small, who've been unable to make up for all the lost sales from their High Street shops.

"The government has defended its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term - after criticism from teachers' unions and council leaders. Food will be provided for children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils say the government should provide food vouchers over half term. ""Vulnerable families will continue to receive meals,"" said a Department for Education (DFE) spokeswoman. ""Our guidance is clear: schools provide free school meals for eligible pupils during term time. ""Beyond that, there is wider government support in place to support families and children via the billions of pounds in welfare support we've made available,"" said the DFE spokeswoman. But the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, said ""the government should provide food vouchers to eligible families during February half-term as it did last summer"" - and that the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme should be used for other support. ""During the last full national lockdown, government recognised the significant extra pressures on low income families and extended free school meal provision into the school holidays,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board. ""Government was explicit that the Covid Winter Grant Scheme was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals, but was to enable councils to support low income households, particularly those at risk of food poverty as we moved towards economic recovery."" The row follows the DFE's publication ofguidelines on free meals,external, after an outcry over pictures of food packages to replace free school meals during the lockdown. The prime minister and other ministers criticised the quality of what was being sent out by some school food firms. Marcus Rashford has spear-headed a campaign for holiday food The DfE guidance says: ""Schools do not need to provide lunch parcels or vouchers during the February half term. ""There is wider government support in place to support families and children outside of term-time through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme."" The DFE insists that even though schools will not provide food parcels or vouchers during half term, children will still be supplied with food through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme. This aims to support those most in need with the cost of food, energy, water bills and other essentials. Councils are required to work out their own local approach to eligibility, using benefits data and their local knowledge to decide how to support vulnerable families. What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes Moving to this scheme for a replacement for school meals during half term, with the added pressure of a lockdown, has drawn criticism from head teachers and teachers. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned that switching schemes meant ""yet more disruption to free schools meals could lie ahead in half term"". He said using this scheme could cause an ""unnecessary logistical nightmare"", suggesting continuing with providing meals through schools would be more simple. Mr Courtney said: ""This week, Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson and Boris Johnson made public statements about how appalled they were by the quality of food parcels shared on Twitter,"" said Mr Courtney. But he said ministers should now ""hang their heads in shame"" for threatening more ""chaos and confusion"" over providing food. ""These are battles which should not have to be repeatedly fought,"" said Mr Courtney. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman accused the the government of ""badly thought out and last-minute schemes to help with holiday hunger"" which he said were ""leaving families and children anxious"". ""The government must urgently clarify for families how they will be helped during the upcoming half term holiday so they can be assured that they will not go hungry,"" said Mr Whiteman. Labour's Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""Time and time again this government has had to be shamed into providing food for hungry children over school holidays."" Food charities and anti-poverty campaigners, including footballer Marcus Rashford, have repeatedly clashed with the government over the issue of food for poor pupils during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly over school holidays. The footballer forced the government to back down in the summer over its plans not to offer free meals in the holidays to poor pupils, whose families were likely to be suffering with reduced incomes. But over the October half-term when the provision was withdrawn many local authorities continued to offer them from their own budgets. Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday?

"The home secretary has said the government will not announce new Covid restrictions on Thursday or Friday, but did not rule out further measures being announced next week. Priti Patel told ITV her focus was on enforcing the current lockdown rules. It is thought ministers are considering measures like requiring masks outside or allowing people to exercise only with people from the same household. On Wednesday,the UK recorded 1,564 new deaths,the highest daily total so far. Mrs Patel emphasised the current stay-at-home rules, under which people are only allowed to go out for a limited number of reasons, including work, essential shopping and providing care to a vulnerable person. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Infections levelling off in some areas - scientist Asked whether further restrictions could include a three-metre social distancing rule, or the requirement to wear masks outside, the home secretary told ITV's This Morning: ""The plans are very much to enforce the rules. ""This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures."" But Ms Patel did not rule out new measures being announced next week, saying: ""We are not thinking about bringing in new measures today or tomorrow."" At a press conference on Monday,she said police would move more quickly to fine people who break the rules. Over the course of the pandemic, more than 30,000 such fines have been issued. A senior backbench Conservative MP has written to his colleagues to criticise the government's approach to coronavirus restrictions. Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, which is sceptical of lockdown measures, said that if the government did not change its strategy, ""inevitably the prime minister's leadership will be on the table: we strongly do not want that after all we have been through as a country"". He asked his colleagues to impress upon the party's chief whip the need for ""a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored, with a guarantee that this strategy will not be used again next winter"". However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why the current lockdown restrictions are ""weaker"" than those imposed in March last year, when deaths and hospitalisations were lower than they are now. He questioned why nurseries were open when primary schools were closed, and whether estate agents should be allowed to continue with house viewings. Rules have been further tightened in Scotland this week, withnew restrictions on click and collect and takeaway services. And in Wales, people areonly allowed to exercise outdoors with members of their household or support bubble., while inNorthern Ireland the rule of six still applies to meetings of people outdoors.

"Coach and tour operators have seen an unexpected growth in bookings in the last fortnight. Industry figures call it growing ""vaccine confidence"" about 2021. Whilst there is no doubt that the pandemic continues to put huge pressure on lives and the NHS, this is a small amount of sunshine for the travel industry, which has had a tough year. TUI, the UK's largest tour operator, says 50% of bookings on their website are currently by over-50s. This was previously a smaller market for them. National Express's coach holiday businesses say bookings made by those 65 and over have increased by 185% in the last fortnight compared to last year. ""Since the announcement of the vaccine, it's given our customer base, predominantly those over 65, increased confidence to book and have that summer getaway in 2021"" says Jit Desai, head of holidays and travel at National Express. ""We launched the brochure for spring-summer 2021 just this weekend gone, and on Monday we took a week's worth of bookings in a day and that's continued so far,"" says Mr Desai. ""What the vaccine does is give certainty and confidence. ""That then allows the customer and ourselves the ability to plan ahead"". The pandemic has been devastating for the travel sector. Tens of thousands of jobs have gone in the UK. Millions of Britons cancelled breaks because the health situation was in flux across the world. But National Express now points to returning confidence to travel. ""Many we've spoken to have had the first jab. They know in 12 weeks they'll get a second jab. It gives them certainty that they can enjoy and look forward to their 2021 holiday. It is something to look forward to, to being with people, with friends, like minded and from the same generation."" Call the Midwife coach tours are popular Dawn and Ray - 75 and 78 years old - are from Hampshire and are due to have their first jab soon. They have just booked five UK holidays. ""We are raring to go once we've got that vaccine, we are really looking forward to it - both of us. We are going to Wales, Leicestershire, to York where there is a mystery tour - and to the Cotswolds'"", Dawn said. For Dawn and Ray, it's the ease of coach travel that's appealing, as well as the safety. She adds ""they've looked after us so well in the past, the coaches are clean, we'll all wear masks, we all look after each other."" At the moment, 90% of the bookings with National Expresses coach businesses are UK based, so it looks like another good year for the staycation. ""European bookings are lower because of the uncertainty on the continent,"" says Mr Desai. ""The UK wins because of the lack of need to quarantine. And uncertainty about the moves other governments might make whilst away also creates fear."" It's not just UK breaks that are selling. The UK's largest tour operator TUI, famous for its sun-drenched European beach holidays, says there has also been a change in the last fortnight. ""We're seeing a customer base or age group that wasn't booking before, that is starting to book,"" says Andrew Flintham the MD of TUI UK. ""The over 50s, we assume, is on the back to the vaccine news."" Whilst TUI UK boss acknowledges that ""the market is still depressed and it's not where we want it - we are seeing glimmers of hope."" Trips to towns in England are among those being booked There are also interesting changes emerging in the types of breaks holidaymakers plan to take and the months they're planning to travel. ""People are booking later into the summer, hedging their bets"" said Mr Flintham. ""More July and August and a lot of demand for September and October. ""People are booking longer holidays, we're seeing more people booking ten or eleven or 14 nights rather than seven. People are maybe catching up on what they've missed."" As TUI analysed its recent booking data, one trend they spotted is the emergence of large, multigenerational group bookings. ""It is family time we've all missed. We can't get away from our own families, but our broader families we can't see, and that's feeding into our choices"" Mr Flintham explains. After such a bad 10 months, and TUI cancelling all holidays until the middle of February at the earliest because of the new lockdown, how does the rest of the summer look?

"Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, a study led by Public Health England shows. Past infection was linked to around a 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. But experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. And officials stress people should follow the stay-at-home rules - whether or not they have had the virus. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, said theresults,externalwere encouraging, suggesting immunity lasted longer than some people feared, but protection was by no means absolute. It was particularly concerning some of those reinfected had high levels of the virus - even without symptoms - and were at risk of passing it on to others, she said. This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said immunity from having Covid-19 is ""not 100% protective"" ""This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others,"" she added. ""Now more than ever, it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives."" Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice? From June to November 2020, almost 21,000 healthcare workers across the UK were regularly tested to see whether they: currently had the coronavirus had had it previously Of those who had no antibodies to the virus, suggesting they may have never had it, 318 developed potential new infections within this timeframe. But among the 6,614 with antibodies, this figure was just 44 potential new infections. Researchers received various different pieces of evidence suggesting these people had become re-infected - including new symptoms more than 90 days after their first infection, new positive swab tests and blood tests. Some tests are still being run and researchers say their results will be updated as they come in. Scientists will continue to monitor the healthcare workers for 12 months to see how long immunity lasts. They will also look closely at cases with the new variant - which was not widespread at the time of this first analysis - and observe the immunity of participants who receive the vaccine. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Dr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, said the results were reassuring for healthcare workers. ""Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity,"" he added. ""We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine. ""So hopefully the results from this paper will reduce the anxiety of many healthcare-worker colleagues who have concerns about getting Covid-19 twice.""

"The government has defended its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term - after criticism from teachers' unions and council leaders. Food will be provided for children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils say the government should provide food vouchers over half term. ""Vulnerable families will continue to receive meals,"" said a Department for Education (DFE) spokeswoman. ""Our guidance is clear: schools provide free school meals for eligible pupils during term time. ""Beyond that, there is wider government support in place to support families and children via the billions of pounds in welfare support we've made available,"" said the DFE spokeswoman. But the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, said ""the government should provide food vouchers to eligible families during February half-term as it did last summer"" - and that the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme should be used for other support. ""During the last full national lockdown, government recognised the significant extra pressures on low income families and extended free school meal provision into the school holidays,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board. ""Government was explicit that the Covid Winter Grant Scheme was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals, but was to enable councils to support low income households, particularly those at risk of food poverty as we moved towards economic recovery."" The row follows the DFE's publication ofguidelines on free meals,external, after an outcry over pictures of food packages to replace free school meals during the lockdown. The prime minister and other ministers criticised the quality of what was being sent out by some school food firms. Marcus Rashford has spear-headed a campaign for holiday food The DfE guidance says: ""Schools do not need to provide lunch parcels or vouchers during the February half term. ""There is wider government support in place to support families and children outside of term-time through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme."" The DFE insists that even though schools will not provide food parcels or vouchers during half term, children will still be supplied with food through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme. This aims to support those most in need with the cost of food, energy, water bills and other essentials. Councils are required to work out their own local approach to eligibility, using benefits data and their local knowledge to decide how to support vulnerable families. What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes Moving to this scheme for a replacement for school meals during half term, with the added pressure of a lockdown, has drawn criticism from head teachers and teachers. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned that switching schemes meant ""yet more disruption to free schools meals could lie ahead in half term"". He said using this scheme could cause an ""unnecessary logistical nightmare"", suggesting continuing with providing meals through schools would be more simple. Mr Courtney said: ""This week, Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson and Boris Johnson made public statements about how appalled they were by the quality of food parcels shared on Twitter,"" said Mr Courtney. But he said ministers should now ""hang their heads in shame"" for threatening more ""chaos and confusion"" over providing food. ""These are battles which should not have to be repeatedly fought,"" said Mr Courtney. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman accused the the government of ""badly thought out and last-minute schemes to help with holiday hunger"" which he said were ""leaving families and children anxious"". ""The government must urgently clarify for families how they will be helped during the upcoming half term holiday so they can be assured that they will not go hungry,"" said Mr Whiteman. Labour's Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""Time and time again this government has had to be shamed into providing food for hungry children over school holidays."" Food charities and anti-poverty campaigners, including footballer Marcus Rashford, have repeatedly clashed with the government over the issue of food for poor pupils during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly over school holidays. The footballer forced the government to back down in the summer over its plans not to offer free meals in the holidays to poor pupils, whose families were likely to be suffering with reduced incomes. But over the October half-term when the provision was withdrawn many local authorities continued to offer them from their own budgets. Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday?

"Dom Bess' (centre) previous five-wicket haul came against South Africa in Port Elizabeth in January 2020 First Test, Galle (day one) Sri Lanka 135:Bess 5-30, Broad 3-20 England 127-2:Root 66*, Bairstow 47* England trail by 8 runs Scorecard Spinner Dom Bess took 5-30 as a woeful Sri Lanka batting display left England in control after the opening day of the first Test in Galle. The hosts were bowled out for 135 in only 46.1 overs despite winning the toss on a pitch that offered only a little spin. England closed on 127-2, with Joe Root unbeaten on 66, Jonny Bairstow 47 not out and their third-wicket stand worth 110. Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley fell to left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya for four and nine respectively. Sri Lanka's total was the lowest in a first innings in a Galle Test, and was a pitiful exhibition of indiscipline and poor strokes which demonstrated a clear lack of understanding of how to build a Test innings. England, who made five changes from their previous Test in August, were disciplined with the ball and tidy in the field, aside from a drop from debutant Dan Lawrence, with Stuart Broad superb in taking 3-20. Their reward was a strong position on their first day of overseas Test cricket since the coronavirus pandemic took hold, and their opening action of a year that includes home and away series against India, a likely two-Test series against world number one side New Zealand and a bid to regain the Ashes in Australia. The second day starts at 04:30 GMT on Friday. 'Right up there with the worst we've seen' - Sri Lanka collapse shocks pundits TMS podcast: England off to a flier With England's most recent Test being played five months ago, and Sri Lanka playing in South Africa over Christmas and the new year, there was concern that the tourists would not be as prepared as the hosts. Those fears soon disappeared. Broad, who had Lahiru Thirimanne caught at leg slip and Kusal Mendis, who has now made a duck in four successive Test innings, caught behind in the seventh over, showcased his experience and guile by turning to off-cutters almost immediately. Bess, playing his 11th Test, may have taken his second five-wicket haul in Tests but struggled to find a consistent line and length. Kusal Perera reverse swept Bess' second ball to Root at slip, while Niroshan Dickwella slapped a long hop to Sibley at point to fall for 12. After getting Dasun Shanaka in fortunate circumstances as a sweep rebounded off Bairstow at short leg into wicketkeeper Jos Buttler's hands, Bess produced a beautifully flighted delivery to bowl Dilruwan Perera between bat and pad for a duck. He rounded off the innings by bowling the reverse-sweeping Wanindu Hasaranga for 19 as the hosts lost their last five wickets for 30 runs. Stand-in captain Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews offered some fight with a stand of 56 for the fourth wicket, the former becoming the 12th Sri Lankan to reach 4,000 Tests runs and Mathews the fifth to 6,000. However, both fell tamely in the space of three balls as Broad - who had taken three wickets in 80 overs in Sri Lanka before this match - had Mathews slashing to slip, before Chandimal looped a simple catch to Sam Curran at cover to give Jack Leach his first Test wicket since November 2019. Quiz: Name England's Test players this century Why the Sri Lanka tour matters for the Ashes For England this two-Test tour, which was cut short in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, is a build-up to the four-Test series in India that follows. To stand any chance of beating Virat Kohli's side England must play spin well, and they will be concerned by the early inroads that Sri Lanka made. Opener Sibley, whom many feel is vulnerable against spin, edged to slip via his back pad as he attempted to work Embuldeniya to leg. Crawley, promoted to open given Rory Burns' absence to be at the birth of his first child, looked to take Embuldeniya over the top - a shot he played superbly last summer - but mistimed it to mid-off. However, Root, whose fifty was his 50th in Test cricket, will be buoyed by the way he and the recalled Bairstow nullified the spin threat as they shared England's highest partnership in Galle. It was a chanceless stand, although Root overturned an lbw decision on 20 with replays showing the ball would have gone over the stumps. Both he and Bairstow scored around the wicket, with Root playing the sweep to good effect, and Bairstow cutting and flicking through mid-wicket well. They will hope to build a substantial first-innings lead and turn the match into a three-innings game. England spinner Dom Bess on BBC Test Match Special:""We have put ourselves in a really good position. Rooty and Jonny batted really well because the wicket started to spin. ""I felt I was quite nervous. I hadn't bowled in a game since the Test matches last summer. ""I didn't feel I bowled as well as I know I can. That's cricket, isn't it? There might be days bowl exceptionally well and go 1-100."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""It was a fantastic day for England. ""The partnership with Root and Bairstow was exactly what was required by Sri Lanka. ""Mathews and Chandimal are experienced pros. They were playing nicely and then played two rash shots. It was so poor from Sri Lanka."" Sri Lanka batting coach Grant Flower:""I'm at a loss for words, I've never seen us bat that badly. They know these conditions well and it should have been a big advantage. ""England's batsmen showed us there's nothing wrong with the pitch. We batted terribly."" Former Sri Lanka all-rounder Russell Arnold:""It is not a minefield. It was very poor from Sri Lanka. England didn't have to work hard at all. ""It is very, very disappointing. It surprised me and I expected a lot more."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. Nobody had immunity at the start of the pandemic - and knowing more about immunity is crucial for understanding what happens next. Our immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as theinnate immune responseand includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus. Instead you need theadaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it - and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? This takes time - studies suggestit takes about 10 days,externalto start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop thestrongest immune response,external. If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. It's not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. Understanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, buta recent study foundpeople testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells. ""They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,"" said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give lifelong immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts. But a recent studyled by Public Health England (PHE) shows most people who have had the virus are protected from catching it again for at least five months (the duration of the analysis so far). Some are reinfected, however, and, even if asymptomatic, can then harbour high levels of the virus in their noses and mouths, which can be passed on to others. PHE will continue to monitor the people in this study, who are all healthcare workers, to see how long immunity lasts. Other clues may come from studies involving other coronaviruses. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients couldbe re-infected within a year,external. Research at King's College London,externalalso suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study. But even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have beenfound in people 90 years,externalafter that pandemic. If the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. It is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)have been found 17 years later.,external Immunity could affect vaccine research Maybe. The jury is still out on the field of ""cross-reactivity"" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. Laboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against the new coronavirus. How common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown. Therewere early reports,externalof people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. PHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different. Experts say re-infection isn't surprising, but it's likely to be rare, and larger studies are needed to understand why this might happen. This is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization isnervous about countries using immunity passports,externalas a way out of lockdown. The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in Chinashowed 30% had very low levels,externalof these neutralising antibodies. That is why the World Health Organization says ""that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery"". Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. Everyone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others. And people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says. People who have already had Covid-19 should still have a vaccine when offered one, officials say. Dr Julian Tang, at the University of Leicester, says:""Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity. ""We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine."" PHE scientists will also monitor the immunity of the participants in itsSiren study,externalwho go on to have vaccines. It matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to.

However, customers will still be able to collect John Lewis orders from its Waitrose stores. Face coverings are compulsory across the UK when in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres, unless you are exempt. Several supermarkets including Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have saidthey will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face maskswho are not  medically exempt. You do not have to wear a face covering if you are a child, if you cannot wear one because of a physical or mental illness or disability, or if its use will cause severe distress. Official guidance makes it clear thatyou do not have to show any written evidence for why you are exempt,external. The government does not provide exemption cards or badges. Ifyou are self-isolatingbecause you have coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has tested positive, oryou are in quarantine after travelling, you must not go shopping. Who needs to wear a face covering while shopping? Pubs, bars and restaurants across most of the UK are currently closed, although they can offer takeaway food and drink with certain restrictions. Alcohol cannot be sold via click-and-collect, but can be ordered for delivery. InScotland, from Saturday 16 January, premises offering takeaways can no longer allow customers indoors, and must operate from a hatch or doorway. Can you still go to the pub?

"Vaccines have transformed the pandemic, but there is still a huge need for drugs which can treat Covid. Immunity from vaccines can wane, and access is still a major problem around the world. Also, new variants emphasise the possible need for a back-up. There are now many drugs that target the virus or our body in different ways: anti-inflammatory drugs that stop our immune system overreacting with deadly consequences anti-viral drugs that make it harder for the coronavirus to replicate inside the body antibody therapies that mimic our own immune system to attack the virus These are all needed at different stages of the infection. They range from dirt cheap to spectacularly expensive, and some are more resilient to new variants than others. When you catch Covid, your body releases a flood of chemicals to warn that you're under attack. This chemical alarm is called inflammation, and is vital for rallying your immune system to boot out Covid. But if you don't get rid of the virus quickly, then inflammation can spiral out of control and eventually damage vital organs such as your lungs. It's this excessive inflammation that kills. An anti-inflammatory steroid that already existed before Covid -dexamethasone- was the first drug proved to save the lives of people with Covid. It's given to seriously ill patients with breathing troubles - it cuts the risk of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a third for those on ventilators. It is also so cheap that it has become the go-to drug around the world - with everywhere from Brazil to China using it. Other anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to work, including the steroid hydrocortisone andbaricitinib, which is normally used in rheumatoid arthritis. There are more advanced and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs such astocilizumab and sarilumab. Tocilizumab has been widely used in hospitals in China, India and Australia. These are also effective, but up to 100 times as expensive as dexamethasone. This has restricted their use - although they are still cheaper than an intensive care bed. Anti-inflammatories work best later on in the disease, but an asthma drug called budesonide has been shown to help vulnerable people with early Covid symptoms recover more quickly at home. An anti-viral directly targets the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself inside our bodies. Such a drug keeps levels of the virus in the body low, so there is less of it for your immune system to deal with. Paxlovid is a pill taken twice a day for five days- according to its maker, Pfizer, it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adults Molnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself- the manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are best taken soon after symptoms appear. Pfizer expects to make 80 million courses of Paxlovid by the end of 2022 and has said it will allow generic makers in 95 low-income nations to produce and distribute it at cost price. Merck is allowing Indian generic drug firms to turn out molnupiravir cheaply for 100 low and middle-income countries. Another anti-viral,remdesivir, is given through a drip and cuts recovery time from Covid. Drug treatments are thought to have great potential for poorer countries such as Sudan, where vaccination is less available The third approach is to give people an infusion of antibodies that can attack the virus. These stick to the surface of the coronavirus and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system. The body makes its own antibodies when it is attacked by coronavirus. The most effective of these have been studied in the lab, grown and given to patients. This is known asmonoclonal antibody therapy. Vulnerable NHS patients to be offered new drug These therapies are often reserved for seriously ill patients who are struggling to make their own antibodies. Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche,reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death Sotrovimab, made by GSK,reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults A different monoclonal antibody treatment calledEvushield,external, made by AstraZeneca, is recommended for some vulnerable people to hopefully prevent disease before they show any signs of being infected. This is known as prophylactic therapy. Anti-inflammatories should work against all variants because they target our own bodies, rather than the virus itself. There is more concern about whether monoclonal antibodies would work with new variants, as they rely on being a close match for the virus. If a new variant is heavily mutated then it theoretically makes the drugs weaker. However, GSK says it has tested its therapy against the Omicron variant and it remains effective in laboratory studies. Anti-virals are expected to hold up against the variants seen so far. None of the mutations seen in Omicron should affect the ability of the drugs to work. However, if the drugs are used widely then there is the potential for drug resistance to emerge. A number of drugs have been heralded as potential therapies for Covid - sometimes with no sign that they actually make any difference. Ivermectin has been controversially promoted for use in many parts of the world, despite no evidence that it works. Taking antibodies from survivors' blood - known as convalescent plasma therapy - has been touted, but has not reduced deaths. There was also speculation that drugs used to treat malaria and HIV might work, but this has come to nothing. FollowJameson Twitter,external BOOSTER:Who can get the fourth jab and how do you book it?

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Exactly one week after security forces with guns drawn defended the House of Representatives against an angry mob, legislators gathered in the same chamber to impeach the president that mob supported. It marked the first time in the 231-year history of the United States that a president has been impeached twice in his term. For a president who likes to boast about the historic successes of his presidency, it is an ignominious ending to his time in office. The single article of impeachment accuses the president of inciting the riot that broke out at the US Capitol after he spoke to a crowd of thousands at a pro-Trump rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. It will now be forwarded to the US Senate, where the 100-member body will once again sit as a jury presided over by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. The outcome of that trial, which will not begin until after Joe Biden's inauguration, is very much in doubt. At this point, however, the political implications for the House's action can begin to be assessed. As it happened: Trump impeachment Just over a year ago, the House of Representatives impeached Trump the first time without a single Republican vote. This time around, 10 members of his own party broke ranks to support the resolution - and more condemned his words and actions on the day of the capitol riot. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, was the most notable defection. ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she wrote in a statement that was frequently quoted by Democrats during the impeachment debate. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? Already there is word that some Republicans in the Senate are open to voting to convict the president of the charges. The New York Times reported on Tuesday night that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was ""pleased"" that Trump was on the verge of being impeached and hoped that the process would allow the party to make a clean break with a president. He has since said he will reserve judgement until the trial is concluded - but such reports from the senator's usually tight-lipped office do not materialise out of thin air. Battle lines within the party, even tentative ones, are being drawn. This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? The split in the House on Wednesday sets up a choice for Republicans in the days ahead. On one hand is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique brand of heat and rhetoric. In the hours after last week's riot, Democrats grappled with how best to respond to - and punish - the president for instigating an attack that, in their view, not only threatened US democracy but also put their lives at risk. In the end, they decided making Trump a twice-impeached president, despite coming in the final week of his presidency, was their most effective move. Democrats on Wednesday were not just impeaching Donald J Trump, however. They were indicting Trumpism as a whole. The impeachment article specifically referenced the months that Trump spent attacking and undermining November's general election. And during debate in the House of Representatives, they attacked Trump's behaviour over the course of his presidency and went after Republicans in Congress who echoed the president's rhetoric. 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol There may be Republicans who want to move on from Trump and Trumpism, but it's clear at least some Democrats in Congress will try to tie the president - and last week's riot - around the neck of the entire Republican Party. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate course of history over the past few months. Donald Trump, instead of vociferously challenging his election defeat, quietly conceded in November. The Republicans would probably have won at least one of the run-off elections in Georgia and would still control the Senate. Trump, instead of facing a very real threat from Republicans eager to bury him, would be a kingmaker for the party. Another presidential run in 2024 would be a very real possibility. Instead, Trump is on the ropes. He's been silenced from social media, including his beloved Twitter account. Even if he is not prohibited from running for office by a Senate conviction, his power and influence within the Republican Party has been dented. What happens to impeached presidents? Public opinion polling, as well as his vocal defenders in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, suggest the president still has a significant well of support within his party. But the past weeks will embolden his adversaries, who sense an opportunity to deliver a lasting knockout to the president while he's down. This video can not be played Republican pollster: 'Three quarters of Trump voters still believe he won' He's at greater risk now than ever before. For five years, Trump has been proving critics and prognosticators who penned his political epitaph wrong. He's survived scandals and controversies that would take down most other politicians. This time, at long last, could be different. Upon taking the oath of office, President-elect Biden will have to contend with a pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 4,000 Americans a day and an economy that is once again worsening. Now he'll have to do so while a Senate grapples with the impeachment trial of his predecessor. Republicans warned on Wednesday that impeachment would further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal. It would, they say, make Biden's promise to unify the nation all the harder. That may end up being the case, although Democrats have been quick to counter that talk of healing rings hollow after Republicans waged a lengthy campaign to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's election. The impeachment trial, however, presents some very real practical challenges for Biden in the early days of his presidency. A Senate preoccupied with the process of passing judgement on Trump is one that will be unable to focus on enacting Biden's ambitious first-100-day agenda. It is also one that may not be able to quickly confirm Biden's administration appointees, limiting his ability to successfully manage the sprawling apparatus of the federal government. Biden has asked whether the Senate could conduct a part-time trial of Trump, working on confirmations and legislation when it is not sitting as a jury for the ex-president. A guide to the inauguration on 20 January There's no guarantees that Republicans or the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian will go along with that plan, however. The first 100 days are a pivotal time for any new president - a moment when his or her political influence is at its highest. At least some of Biden's power will be drained away by this particular fight. Did Trump's words incite the riot? A day that shook America.

"The co-founder for Cyberpunk 2077's developer has released a new video explaining what went wrong with the game. CD Projekt's Marcin IwiÅski admitted they ""underestimated the task"" of adapting the game for consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Gamers reported glitches including choppy frame rates and screen tearing. Marcin says he's ""deeply sorry for this and this video is me publicly owning up"". The game was arguably the most anticipated release of 2020 but the launch just before Christmas was a disaster. The problems led to Sony and Microsoftremoving the gamefrom online stores and gamers were offered refunds. Cyberpunk 2077 is a set in the fictional Night City - a dystopian future where pollution and crime are rampant and social inequality is the norm. In the video, Marcin explains issues originated from Cyperpunk's ""huge"" scope, particularly the high number ""of custom objects, interacting systems, and mechanics"", making it a complex game.

So despite working well for high-end PCs, it couldn't be adjusted to older generation consoles such as the PS4 and Xbox One, making in-game streaming difficult. ""We hit the ground running on PC. While not perfect, it's a version of Cyberpunk we're very proud of."" Cyberpunk 2077: How did the release go so wrong? Cyberpunk 2077 makers apologise for game glitches Marcin adds that testing did not ""show a big part of the issues"" that gamers experienced. ""As we got closer to the final release, we saw significant improvements each and every day."" He also blames the coronavirus pandemic for creating issues for CD Projekt as they tried to improve performance after launch. ""A lot of the dynamics we normally take for granted got lost over video calls or email. And we took that hit too."" Looks good right? But this wasn't what the game looked like for a lot of console gamers Marcin added the ""incredibly hard working and talented"" development team should not be blamed for problems, saying the final decision came down to him and the board. ""Believe me, we never ever intended for anything like this to happen. I assure you that we will do our best to regain your trust"". As part of that, he says they intend to fix the problems and improve the game across platforms. ""Our ultimate goal is to fix the bugs and crashes,"" he says, with updates to the game expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.

"Tesco says it has seen some disruption to food supplies in Northern Ireland since trading arrangements with the EU changed on 1 January. ""We see this as a challenge at the moment, but not a crisis,"" boss Ken Murphy said. But he said the retailer was working closely with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to ""smooth the flow"". Since 31 December, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has stayed in the EU's single market for goods. Mr Murphy said certain foodstuffs had faced supply chain disruption going into both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""Ready meals have been the most affected as they have an eight-day shelf life so any wait is more likely to have an impact,"" he said. ""Some processed meat and some citrus fruit has also been impacted, but it is important to stress that our availability in the Republic and Northern Ireland is strong and is very strong in the mainland UK. Last week, all the major grocers wrote to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove asking him to take urgent action. Supermarkets call for action on NI food supplies Supply problems for supermarkets being 'overcome' But Tesco said its ""comprehensive preparations and... strong relationships with suppliers"" had allowed it to maintain strong levels of availability during the Brexit transition period. Mr Murphy said he was confident Tesco would have the right measures in place to supply Northern Ireland after end of a three month grace period on certain rules and regulations with the EU on 31 March. He also said there had also been ""teething problems"" with supply flows from continental Europe to Great Britain. ""Inevitably there are bedding-in issues, teething issues, that you would expect with any new process that's been set up at relatively short notice,"" he said. ""We're working our way through those and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product."" Under new trading arrangements, food products entering Northern Ireland from Britain need to be professionally certified and are subject to new checks and controls at ports. Marks & Spencer has temporarily reduced its range of food products in Northern Ireland A three month ""grace period"" means that supermarkets currently don't need to comply with all the EU's usual certification requirements until 1 April - but there has still been disruption. M&S has temporarily reduced its range of food products and Sainsbury's has been sourcing Spar-branded products from an NI wholesaler. This week the bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Iceland, Co-Op and Marks & Spencer warned that trade into Northern Ireland would become ""unworkable"" if further new certification requirements were introduced in April . The government said a new dedicated team has already been set up and will be working with supermarkets, the food industry and the Northern Ireland Executive to develop ways to streamline the movement of goods. Tesco's comments came as the supermarket giant reported record sales for the Christmas period after customers looked to ""treat themselves"" amid tough Covid restrictions across most of the UK. UK like-for-like sales were up 8.1% in the six weeks to 9 January, as the supermarket saw a surge in demand for goods in its Tesco Finest range. Big grocers have benefited at a time when most non-essential shops and restaurants are closed, prompting consumers to spend more on their weekly shop. But they have faced criticism too. Last month, Tesco said it wouldrepay Â£585m of business rates reliefafter it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders during the crisis. Most big grocers followed suit. Tesco was later criticised for keeping its shops open on Boxing Daydespite union calls to give staff the day off. In its results the grocer said it had given all frontline staff a 10% bonus over Christmas. It also said it had shielded vulnerable staff and taken on nearly 35,000 additional temporary staff for the season.

"More than 100,000 Covid-19 vaccinations had been issued in Northern Ireland by Tuesday evening, Robin Swann has said. The health minister said, of that figure, 91,419 people had received their first vaccine dose. He added that 95% of care home residents had received their first dose and about 20% of those aged over 80 have received their first dose. It comes as leading GP said the goal to begin a mass vaccine rollout by summer is ""achievable"" but hinges on supply. The Department of Health published itsplan to deliver vaccines in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. Dr Alan Stout said thetimelinewas ""very sensible"" but was ""almost 100%"" dependent on getting enough of the vaccine. At Wednesday's health briefing, Mr Swann said the programme had made a ""strong start"" but there was more to do. He also said he has decided to issue tighter visiting guidelines for hospitals. Health Minister gives Covid briefing ""I have ensured visiting will be permitted to hospices and care homes, but visits to general medical wards will no longer be permitted from this Friday"", he said. The minister added that the measure would be kept under constant review. Mr Swann also confirmed a new rapid test for Covid-19, which can return results in 12 minutes, would be used in emergency departments. He said a pilot programme has been carried out using the LumiraDX nasal swab, which will enable health staff to ""very quickly identify patients who do not have Covid-19"". Mr Swann at Wednesday's briefing He also repeated that the current lockdown restrictions were working and had helped to reduce NI's rate of infection, but warned the executive would still have ""difficult decisions"" to take in relation to decisions about whether to extend some restrictions in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, a further 19 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. A further 1,145 new cases of the virus were also reported. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned there was ""no doubt"" that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of coronavirus are rising in Northern Ireland. Speaking at Stormont's executive briefing, Dr Michael McBride said that the new variant was making the job to contain it ""twice as difficult"". The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence it is more dangerous. Thefirst confirmed case of the new strain was detected in Northern Ireland on 23 December, but officials had said levels in Northern Ireland remained lower than in other areas of the UK. Dr McBride said there would now be situations where the variant could spread, where previously it may not have. ""We need to be extremely cautious in the weeks ahead,"" he warned, adding that the virus would not ""magically disappear"" on 6 February, when the current lockdown is due to end. Stormont ministers have to review the regulations on or before 22 January, with that scheduled for next Thursday. Dr McBride said Northern Ireland had some distance to go before restrictions are lifted Dr Stout, the chair of NI's GP committee, said practices needed another 22,000 doses to finish vaccinating people aged over 80. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, he said he was ""very confident"" the next doses would come through shortly.

""This is such a good news story that everybody wants the vaccine and everybody wants to give it."" The plan is for the vaccine to be given to the general population in summer 2021. GP clinics should have received their first delivery of the vaccine by Tuesday. Responding to reports in The Daily Telegraph thatGPs administering the vaccine in England had been asked to ""slow down"" to let other regions ""catch-up"",external, Dr Stout said Northern Ireland had taken a different approach to how it rolled out vaccines to GPs. He said vaccines were shared among all practices in Northern Ireland. ""We just don't have the full amount of vaccine in practice to give. We could have given all of the vaccine that a certain number of practices needed to start with but there were issues with inequality and discrimination ... so that's why an amount has gone to every single practice, so at least they have some.""

"Passengers will need to provide a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before departure Passengers arriving into NI from outside the UK and Republic of Ireland will soon have to produce a negative Covid-19 test before departure. First Minister Arlene Foster confirmed the executive had agreed the plan on Thursday. People arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days. The move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland. Passengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday. Negative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa. Speaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the ""very real"" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still ""no room for complacency"". She said she still believed there needed to be an ""two-island approach"" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a ""matter of urgency"". Mrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated. PSNI Chief Constable (centre) Simon Byrne attended Stormont's press briefing on Thursday with the first and deputy first ministers PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. He told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect ""firm and swift enforcement"". ""We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules."" On Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. There have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. Mrs Foster said she found it ""incredible and frankly unbelievable"" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. On Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising. Mr Swann said that meant more ""difficult decisions"" on lockdown restrictions could be required. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January. The first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required. Ministers have expressed concerns about keeping non-essential parts of businesses open Ministers have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers ""gaming"" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses. A meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon. Passengers can have Covid-19 test at airport Negative Covid test required for Ireland arrivals Elsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month. Dr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.

Mr Swann was asked if his department was ""putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket"". He said it was ""not the entirety of the answer"", adding: ""It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in. ""And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place. ""We may actually have to introduce more."" On Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination. She said that would be an ""incredible achievement"" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations. At present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations. PFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a ""difficult position"". The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers. ""I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,"" Mr Lindsay toldBBC Radio Foyle.

"Halima Aden, the first hijab-wearing supermodel, quit the fashion industry in November saying it was incompatible with her Muslim religion. Here, in an exclusive interview, she tells BBC Global Religion reporter Sodaba Haidare the full story - how she became a model, and how she reached the decision to walk away. Halima, 23, is in St Cloud, Minnesota, where she grew up surrounded by other Somalis. She's wearing ordinary clothes and no makeup, cheerfully petting her dog, Coco. ""I'm Halima from Kakuma,"" she says, referring to the refugee camp in Kenya, where she was born. Others have described her as a trailblazing hijab-wearing supermodel or as the first hijabi model to feature on the cover of Vogue magazine - but she left all that behind two months ago, saying the fashion industry clashed with her Muslim faith. ""It's the most comfortable I've ever felt in an interview,"" she laughs. ""Because I didn't spend 10 hours getting ready, in an outfit I couldn't keep."" As a hijab-wearing model, Halima was selective about her clothing. At the start of her career, she would take a suitcase filled with her own hijabs, long dresses and skirts to every shoot. She wore her own plain black hijab for her first campaign for Rihanna's Fenty Beauty. However she was dressed, keeping her hijab on for every shoot was non-negotiable. It was so important to her that in 2017 when she signed with IMG, one of the biggest modelling agencies in the world, she added a clause to her contract making IMG agree that she would never have to remove it. Her hijab meant the world to her. Halima modelling for Max Mara in February 2017 ""There are girls who wanted to die for a modelling contract,"" she says, ""but I was ready to walk away if it wasn't accepted."" This was despite the fact that at that stage no-one had heard of her - that she was ""a nobody"". But as time went on she had less control over the clothes she wore, and agreed to head coverings she would have ruled out at the start. ""I eventually drifted away and got into the confusing grey area of letting the team on-set style my hijab."" In the last year of her career her hijab got smaller and smaller, sometimes accentuating her neck and chest. And sometimes instead of the hijab, she wrapped jeans, or other clothes and fabrics, around her head. On the runway for Tommy Hilfiger London Spring 2020 Another clause of Halima's contract guaranteed her a blocked-out box, allowing her to get dressed in the privacy of her own space. But she soon realised that other hijab-wearing models, who had followed her into the industry, were not being treated with the same respect. She would see them being told to find a bathroom to change in. ""That rubbed me the wrong way and I was like, 'OMG, these girls are following in my footsteps, and I have opened the door to the lion's mouth.'"" She had expected her successors to be her equals, and this intensified her protective feelings towards them. ""A lot of them are so young, it can be a creepy industry. Even the parties that we attended, I would always find myself in big sister mode having to grab one of the hijab-wearing models because she'd be surrounded by a group of men following and flocking [round] her. I was like,  'This doesn't look right, she's a child.' I would pull her out and ask her who she was with."" Part of this sense of responsibility and community comes from Halima's Somali background. As a child in Kakuma refugee camp, in north-western Kenya, she was taught by her mother to work hard and to help others. And this continued after they moved to Minnesota, when Halima was seven, becoming part of the largest Somali community in the US. So there was a problem when Halima became her high school's first hijab-wearing homecoming queen (an honour bestowed on the school's most popular students). She knew her mum, whose focus was on good grades, would disapprove. ""I was so embarrassed, because when you get nominated, the kids come to your house and I said, 'Don't do that - my mum will have the shoe ready and you wouldn't know what you've gotten yourselves into!'"" Her fears were justified. Halima's mum broke the homecoming crown. ""You're focusing way too much on friends and beauty pageants,"" she said. But Halima still took part in Miss Minnesota USA in 2016. She was the first hijab-wearing contestant and became a semi-finalist. Competing in the Miss Minnesota pageant in 2016 And then, to her mother's dismay, Halima chose to pursue a career in modelling - a  career her mother felt was in conflict with who Halima was as a person: black, Muslim, refugee. Even when she started walking on some of the world's major runways for Yeezy and Max Mara, or became a Miss USA judge, her mother still encouraged her to ""get a proper job"". It was the humanitarian side of Halima's career that had gone some way to convincing her mother that it was worth it. As a refugee who had walked 12 days from Somalia to Kenya for a better life, she knew the value of helping those in need. ""She said, 'There's no way you'll do modelling if it doesn't have a giving-back component.' In my first meeting with IMG I told them to take me to Unicef,"" Halima says. IMG supported her in this and in 2018 Halima became a Unicef ambassador. As she had spent her childhood in a refugee camp, her work focused on children's rights. ""My mum never viewed me as a model or cover girl. She viewed me as a beacon of hope for young girls and would always remind me to be a good role model for them."" Halima wanted to raise awareness about displaced children, and to show the children that if she could make it out of the refugee camp, they could hope to one day do the same. But Unicef didn't live up to her expectations. In 2018, not long after becoming a Unicef ambassador, she visited the Kakuma camp to give a Ted Talk. ""I met with the kids and asked them, 'Are things still being done the way they were, do you still have to dance and sing in front of newcomers?' They said, 'Yes, but this time we're not doing it for other celebrities they'd bring to the camp, this time we're doing it for you.'"" Halima was guilt-stricken and upset. She says she still remembers when she and other children sang and danced for visiting celebrities. ""The UN workers prepped me for what was to come: I had my first headshot, thanks to those organisations."" Sudanese refugees dancing at Kakuma refugee camp It seemed to her that the organisation focused more on its brand than on children's education. ""I could spell 'Unicef' when I couldn't spell my own name. I was marking X,"" she says. ""Minnesota gave me my first book, my first pencil, my first backpack. Not Unicef."" She had assumed all of that had changed since she left. In November, when she video-called the kids in Kakuma for World Children's Day, she decided she couldn't carry on. It was hard to see them in winter in the middle of a global pandemic. ""After speaking to the kids, I had a breakthrough,"" she says. ""I just decided I'm done with the NGO world using me for 'my beautiful story of courage and hope'"" Unicef USA told the BBC: ""We are grateful for [Halima's] three-and-a-half years of partnership and support. Her remarkable story of resilience and hope has guided her vision for a world that upholds the rights of every child. It has been a privilege for Unicef to work with Halima and we wish her all the best in her future endeavours."" Halima's doubts about the modelling side of her career had also been multiplying. As demand for her in the fashion industry grew, she spent less time with her family and would be away from home on Muslim religious festivals. ""In the first year of my career I was able to make it home for Eid and Ramadan but in the last three years, I was travelling. I was sometimes on six to seven flights a week. It just didn't pause,"" she says. Halima Aden watching a model wearing clothes designed by Sherri Hill In September 2019, she was featured on the cover of King Kong magazine, wearing bright red and green eye shadow and a large piece of jewellery on her face. It resembled a mask and covered everything but her nose and mouth. ""The style and makeup were horrendous. I looked like a white man's fetishised version of me,"" she says. And to her horror, she found a picture of a nude man in the same issue. ""Why would the magazine think it was acceptable to have a hijab-wearing Muslim woman when a naked man is on the next page?"" she asks. It went against everything she believed in.

King Kong told the BBC: ""The artists, photographers and contributors with whom we work express themselves in ways which may both appeal to some and seem provocative to others, but the stories they produce always respect the subject and the model. ""We are sorry that Halima now regrets the work she did with us, and that there were images in the issue that she personally did not like, but were in no way connected to her own feature."" Halima says that when she spotted her photograph on the cover of magazines at airports, as she travelled between shoots, she would often barely recognise herself. ""I had zero excitement because I couldn't seemyself. Do you know how mentally damaging that can be to be to somebody? When I'm supposed to feel happy and grateful and I'm supposed to relate, because that's me, that's my own picture, but I was so far removed. ""My career was seemingly on top, but I was mentally not happy."" And there were those other problems - her hijab rule getting stretched to breaking point, and the way other hijab-wearing models were being treated. The coronavirus pandemic put everything in perspective. With Covid-19 halting fashion shoots and runway shows, she returned home to St Cloud to spend time with her mother, to whom she remains incredibly close. ""I was having anxiety thinking of 2021 because I loved staying at home with my family and seeing friends again,"" she says. Fashion rip-offs: Independent designers 'copied' by High Street Makeup's big Palm Oil secret The beauty guru with no arms or legs All this explains why, in November, she decided to give up both modelling and her role with Unicef. ""I'm grateful for this new chance that Covid gave me. We're all reflecting about our career paths and asking, 'Does it bring me genuine happiness, does it bring me joy?'"" she says. Her mother's prayers had finally been granted. She was so elated she even agreed to do a photoshoot with her daughter, just for fun. ""When I was a model, my mum turned down every shoot, she wouldn't even do mother-daughter campaigns. I wanted to give her a chance to see me in my creative zone,"" says Halima excitedly. ""She really is my number one inspiration and I'm so grateful God picked me to be her daughter. She's truly a remarkable and resilient woman."" Halima with her mother, sister Fadumo (left) and cousin Rahma The photoshoot is not the only thing Halima is excited about. She has just finished executive-producing a film inspired by the true story of a refugee fleeing war and violence in Afghanistan. I Am You is due to be released on Apple TV in March. ""We're anxiously waiting to see if we've been nominated for an Oscar!"" she says. Quitting Unicef doesn't mean Halima has given up doing charity work. ""I'm not going to stop volunteering,"" she says. ""I don't think the world needs me as a model or celebrity, it needs me as Halima from Kakuma - somebody who understands the true value of a penny and the true value of community."" But first she is going to take a break. ""You know, I've never been on a proper vacation. I'm putting my mental health and my family at the top. I'm thriving, not just surviving. I'm getting my mental health checked, I'm getting therapy time.""

"This video can not be played Residents of an asylum seeker camp in Pembrokeshire says life is 'very bad' Asylum seekers housed in a military training camp have claimed the ""very bad"" conditions are making them feel increasingly desperate. The Home Office decided to house up to 250 asylum seekers at the site in Penally, Pembrokeshire, from September. But some housed at the camp claim the conditions are unsafe and putting them at risk of coronavirus. Plaid Cymru has called for an urgent inspection, but the Home Office said it was safe and ""Covid-compliant"". On Thursday afternoon, the independent chief inspector for borders and immigration David Bolt said he hoped an inspection can begin ""within a few weeks"" and was awaiting further details he requested from the Home Office. Protests and counter-protests have taken place at the camp, with concerns conditions breach human rights. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the facility was""unsuitable"" for vulnerable people who have ""fled terror and suffering"". Now, asylum seekers have spoken to the BBC about their experiences of living in the camp during the pandemic, with some claiming the site does not abide by Covid-19 rules. Photos taken inside the camp show the living conditions in one of the rooms One man, who wishes to remain anonymous, arrived at the camp on 1 October. He said he had pain from ""old injuries"" obtained in Syria, but had to wait ""four days"" to see a doctor. He also has concerns about hygiene facilities at the camp. ""There is no observance of the Covid safety laws,"" he said, claiming ""six men"" share a small bedroom, dozens eat in the same room, and some staff preparing food do not wear face masks. Video footage and photographs of the camp, seen by BBC Wales, show bathroom floors covered with water, every toilet in one bathroom blocked, beds in communal rooms less than 2m (6ft) apart and a bathroom where all the soap dispensers are empty. The Home Office said medical need determined GP appointments, social distancing was required, and soap was replenished at the site. The man said the camp's conditions had left him in a ""bad psychological state"" and others had attempted self-harm: ""Should I try to hurt myself to get out of here?"" He said he and other residents were able to leave the camp as long as they are back by 22:00 GMT, but said he was reluctant to go out due to the ""humiliation, abuse and racism"" he has experienced. The site has attracted protests in recent months While some have welcomed the refugees, posting welcome notes outside the gates, the camp hasbeen described as a target for ""hard-right extremist"" protesters. The Home Office said that, where someone claims their mental health is suffering, it would consider if their needs can be met at the site. Homophobic attacks for welcoming asylum seekers 'Human rights ignored' at asylum seeker camp Another resident, from Eritrea, north-east Africa, said life in the camp was stressful, and people were being ""treated like prisoners"". ""For the Eritrean community in this camp, the most difficult thing is we escaped from our country from indefinite military service and illegal imprisonment,"" he said. ""So we feel like we are imprisoned in a military camp. It is all coming back to us."" One resident said it was impossible to maintain social distancing in a room with six people The man said he had been told to be careful and to abide to Covid rules, but there was ""no protection"" as he was sleeping in a room with five others. ""Most of the bathrooms - they are broken,"" he said. ""They are filled with tissues, masks, everything you can find, they are blocked, they don't work."" He said he had not been offered a coronavirus test since arriving about three months ago. The Home Office said residents had often entered the UK some time ago, and had been mainly placed in the camp after being in the south-east of England and around London. It added that coronavirus tests were only necessary in line with Welsh Government guidance. It added that Clearsprings Ready Homes, which manage the camp, took immediate steps to repair damage. Some have welcomed the asylum seekers in the community But Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, has called for an ""urgent"" and ""transparent"" inspection of the site. In a letter to the UK's Independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Bolt, the MP said: ""We are now not only in the middle of winter, but cases of Covid-19 in Wales are rising at an alarming rate. ""I am extremely worried that the conditions at the old military barracks are wholly unsuitable to deal with the cold weather and to facilitate effective social distancing. ""This shows a clear disregard for the health and wellbeing of those being kept in the camp."" About 40 men took part in the protest outside the camp in November over claims their human rights were being breached She told BBC Radio Wales: ""If we aspire to be a nation of sanctuary, surely we should be looking at how people, while they are with us, are integrated into our communities and given all the services that they need, rather than putting them in a convenient enclosed space in a tiny community which is ill equipped itself to deal with this... Let alone far right protests outside and all the pressure that's put on the local population. ""We need to make sure that this doesn't set a precedent into the future."" Mr Bolt told Ms Saville Roberts he had ""received assurances"" from the Home Office that the Penally camp had an independent Covid-19 audit on 4 November. In a letter, he said he hoped an inspection could be held ""within a few weeks"". He said he was keen to understand how the Home Office ""was assuring itself"" individuals who were particularly vulnerable, including torture victims, potential victims of modern slavery, and those with complex health and other needs, were being identified and action taken to safeguard them. He said: ""While on site I would expect the only restrictions to be those relating to Covid-19 and that inspectors would be free to examine the premises and facilities, observe daily life and interview staff and service users, and I would look to the Home Office to ensure that whoever is responsible for managing the site understands that they must cooperate with the inspection team."" In December, the Welsh Labour Government deputy minister Jane Hutt called on the Home Secretary Priti Patel to close the camp, describing the conditions as ""unsafe"" and ""inhumane"". Tom Nunn, a solicitor representing some of the residents at camp, said the Home Office had said the camp should only be used as short-term accommodation for single, asylum-seeking males with no known vulnerabilities. But he said 20 clients had been transferred away from the camp due to being vulnerable, and feared a serious incident would happen if things did not change. ""The majority of them have been detained and/or tortured in their country of origin, many have been exploited on their journey to the UK and a large number have fairly severe mental health problems,"" he said. ""It should not be the case that the only effective way of being transferred out is through making submissions through lawyers, and we are concerned about a large number of individuals who for a myriad of reasons may be unable to obtain this representation."" The UK's Minister for Immigration Compliance, Chris Philp, said: ""We provide asylum seekers in Penally with safe, Covid-compliant and weather-proof accommodation along with free, nutritious meals, all paid for by the taxpayer. ""We take the welfare of those in our care extremely seriously and asylum seekers can contact the 24/7 helpline run by Migrant Help if they have any issues. ""We are fixing our asylum system to make it firm and fair. We will be bringing forward legislation which will stop abuse of the system while ensuring it is compassionate towards those who need our help, welcoming people through safe and legal routes.""

Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.

The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more. A team from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO)has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to begin its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Fabian Leendertz is a professor in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms at Germanyâs public health institute and will be working with the team in China. He toldBBC World Newsthat these steps are very positive. This video can not be played What is the starting point for WHOâs Wuhan Covid probe? The government says food over the February half term would be provided for children who usually get free school meals by local councils, under theCovid Winter Grant Scheme. But Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, says the government has ""shifted the goal posts"". He told Radio 4's PM that the governmentâs own guidance
on the Covid Winter Grant Scheme explicitly said it ""was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals"". ""The goalposts have just shifted on it, because we
were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Employers ""have a duty"" to support staff who suffer domestic abuse but few have adequate policies in place, the government says. It said bosses were in a unique position to help but a ""lack of awareness and stigma"" held them back. Calls to domestic abuse services have surged in the pandemic as couples spend more time at home. Business Minister Paul Scully said employers could be a ""bridge between a worker and the support they need"". ""It was once taboo to talk about mental health, but now most workplaces have well-established policies in place. We want to see the same happen for domestic abuse, but more quickly and more effectively,"" he said in an open letter to employers. Domestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge Managers and colleagues are often the only other people outside the home that victims talk to each day and so ""uniquely placed"" to spot signs of abuse, he said. These include becoming more withdrawn than usual, sudden drops in performance, mentions of controlling or coercive behaviour in partners, or physical signs such as bruising. Employers did not have to become ""specialists"" in handling domestic abuse, Mr Scully said, but could do more to help, including: Ensuring staff can spot the signs of a colleague facing domestic abuse so they can respond appropriately and sympathetically Communicating that they are there to help, and promoting information about support services Fostering a more open work environment where workers feel able to share problems And offering practical support such as space and privacy to make calls and arrangements or access to financial help. Firms already taking action include Vodafone, which offers specialist training to HR and line managers and support for victims including counselling and additional paid leave. In August, law firm Linklaters strengthened its policies and now offers people who need to flee their home but can't stay with others three nights' accommodation in a hotel. It also offers the option of paid leave, plus one-off payments of Â£5,000 to help victims trying to become financially independent. Domestic violence charity Refuge said it saw an 80% increase in calls to its helpline during the first national lockdown, a trend the government believes has continued. And in November, 43% of respondents to a survey by charity Surviving Economic Abuse showed an abuser had interfered with someone's ability to work or study from home during the crisis. Examples included hiding phones or computers, removing wi-fi connections, and phoning an employer claiming a breach of lockdown rules, in an apparent effort to get them sacked. Domestic abuse isn't a new problem, nor does today's call to businesses apply only during a pandemic. But coronavirus has highlighted new and existing risks. For many victims and survivors, work is a place of respite. Being based at home, or on furlough, can reduce communication with team members, and prevent face-to-face chats with colleagues. I've heard of employers finding simple yet effective ways of supporting staff during the pandemic. For example, finding a plausible reason for an employee whose remote communications were being overlooked, to go into the office as a one-off, so they could talk freely and hand over an ID document for safe keeping. Of course, not every business can afford to offer emergency accommodation or financial support to those in urgent need.  But the focus of today's letter is on awareness, using free support and removing stigma. The charity Surviving Economic Abuse wants the government to go further, and put paid leave for domestic abuse victims into law. Elizabeth Filkin, who chairs the Employer's Initiative on Domestic Abuse, argues there are real benefits in supporting staff - including around productivity, loyalty and reputation. Employment lawyer Sarah Chilton, a partner at CM Murray, told the BBC that all employers have a duty to protect their staff's health and safety while working from home. That includes if they are being subjected to domestic abuse. ""Where an employee is required to work at home during, for example, the pandemic, the employer should take account of any risk to that person's physical and mental health and safety in the environment in which they work."" Angela Ogilvie, global director of HR at Linklaters, said training was vital to spot signs of abuse, especially now. ""Victims may avoid calls or videos for example. They may become quiet, anxious or tearful, secretive about their home life. ""And it's being conscious of how you start those conversations because they may be overheard, so you may have to switch your conversation to email or text."" Mr Scully said the government would consult on ways to help domestic abuse victims at work, for instance by making it easier to request flexible working. The government's Domestic Abuse Bill also continues to make its way through parliament. It will bring into law a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes coercive or controlling behaviour as well as emotional and economic abuse.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over last week's deadly storming of Congress. The House of Representatives accused Mr Trump of encouraging violence with his false claims of election fraud. He now faces trial in the upper chamber, the Senate, but not before he leaves office next Wednesday. Senators can vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. In a video released after the vote,externalin the House on Wednesday, Mr Trump called on his followers to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment. ""Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence,"" he said, striking a sombre and conciliatory tone. 'Symbolic but necessaryâ: US voters react What happens to impeached presidents? Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots The FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president. This video can not be played Trump: 'Violence and vandalism have no place in our country' Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. He urged them to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard, but also to ""fight like hell"" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen. Following Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter. The building was placed on lockdown and five people died in the melee. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted"". It says he then repeated these claims and ""wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol"", leading to the violence and loss of life. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government."" Last week, 139 Republicans voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump was charged with inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?The House of Representatives has impeached him, moving the case to the Senate for a trial. But a trial will not be carried out before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January So what does it mean?A trial can happen after his term ends, and senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again For two hours on Wednesday, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote in the same chamber where they hid under chairs and donned gas masks as rioters tried to force their way inside last week. National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. Ten of Mr Trump's Republican party joined Democrats to impeach him by 232-197. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on the House floor: ""The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."" Democratic congressman Julian Castro called Mr Trump ""the most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office"". This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? Most Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity. ""Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. ""That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters."" Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, accused Democrats of recklessly dividing the country to pursue a political vendetta. ""This is about getting the president of the United States. It's always been about getting the president, no matter what. It's an obsession."" Among members of the president's party who voted to impeach him was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney. The Wyoming representative, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said of the riot that ""there has never been a greater betrayal by a president"". Donald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice. A year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration. Impeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead. The party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot Read more from Anthony The impeachment article will head to the Senate, which will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority is needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. If Mr Trump is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers could hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024. But the trial will not come during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: ""Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week."" He said it would best serve the interests of the nation if Congress focused on a safe and orderly transition of power for the incoming Biden administration. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell also said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote. Mindful that his first days in office could become mired in the impeachment drama, Mr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the ""other urgent business of this nation"", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme. However, a Republican congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced she would file articles of impeachment against Mr Biden, accusing him of abuse of power, the day after his inauguration. No US president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings in Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. So was Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Vitamin D supplements are recommended by public health officials during the lockdown There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D can help fight coronavirus. The Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition and the health watchdog theNational Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have done a rapid review of the evidence,external. With more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some may have been deprived of vitamin D. Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun. The NHS says,externalpeople should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors. Free winter Vitamin D for vulnerable in England Scottish,externalandWelsh,externalgovernments andNorthern Ireland's Public Health Agency,externalissued similar advice during lockdown. Before the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March. Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if: you are not often outdoors you live in a care home you usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when outside People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement. There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) peoplehave a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults. There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections. Some studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help,externalwhen we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent. TheScientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN),externalsays studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this. A review of research by NICE,externalsuggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus. But experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible. Some researchers have suggested thatvitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes,externalif someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making ithard to draw conclusions,external. Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed. No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run. If you choose to take vitamin D supplements: Children aged one to 10 should not have more than 50 micrograms a day Infants (under 12 months) should not have more than 25 micrograms a day Adults should not have more than 100 micrograms a day, with the recommended amount 10 micrograms a day A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health UK LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency. Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet. The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants. Vitamin drops are available for babies. Some cereals are fortified with vitamin D Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic. It can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D. Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun. Cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage. The advice is: breastfed babies from birth to one year old should be given a daily supplement of 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin D to make sure they get enough formula-fed babies should not be given a supplement until they are having less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day, because formula contains vitamin D children aged one to four should be given a daily supplement of 10 micrograms The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women.  A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies.

"Vaccines have transformed the pandemic, but there is still a huge need for drugs which can treat Covid. Immunity from vaccines can wane, and access is still a major problem around the world. Also, new variants emphasise the possible need for a back-up. There are now many drugs that target the virus or our body in different ways: anti-inflammatory drugs that stop our immune system overreacting with deadly consequences anti-viral drugs that make it harder for the coronavirus to replicate inside the body antibody therapies that mimic our own immune system to attack the virus These are all needed at different stages of the infection. They range from dirt cheap to spectacularly expensive, and some are more resilient to new variants than others. When you catch Covid, your body releases a flood of chemicals to warn that you're under attack. This chemical alarm is called inflammation, and is vital for rallying your immune system to boot out Covid. But if you don't get rid of the virus quickly, then inflammation can spiral out of control and eventually damage vital organs such as your lungs. It's this excessive inflammation that kills. An anti-inflammatory steroid that already existed before Covid -dexamethasone- was the first drug proved to save the lives of people with Covid. It's given to seriously ill patients with breathing troubles - it cuts the risk of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a third for those on ventilators. It is also so cheap that it has become the go-to drug around the world - with everywhere from Brazil to China using it. Other anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to work, including the steroid hydrocortisone andbaricitinib, which is normally used in rheumatoid arthritis. There are more advanced and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs such astocilizumab and sarilumab. Tocilizumab has been widely used in hospitals in China, India and Australia. These are also effective, but up to 100 times as expensive as dexamethasone. This has restricted their use - although they are still cheaper than an intensive care bed. Anti-inflammatories work best later on in the disease, but an asthma drug called budesonide has been shown to help vulnerable people with early Covid symptoms recover more quickly at home. An anti-viral directly targets the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself inside our bodies. Such a drug keeps levels of the virus in the body low, so there is less of it for your immune system to deal with. Paxlovid is a pill taken twice a day for five days- according to its maker, Pfizer, it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adults Molnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself- the manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are best taken soon after symptoms appear. Pfizer expects to make 80 million courses of Paxlovid by the end of 2022 and has said it will allow generic makers in 95 low-income nations to produce and distribute it at cost price. Merck is allowing Indian generic drug firms to turn out molnupiravir cheaply for 100 low and middle-income countries. Another anti-viral,remdesivir, is given through a drip and cuts recovery time from Covid. Drug treatments are thought to have great potential for poorer countries such as Sudan, where vaccination is less available The third approach is to give people an infusion of antibodies that can attack the virus. These stick to the surface of the coronavirus and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system. The body makes its own antibodies when it is attacked by coronavirus. The most effective of these have been studied in the lab, grown and given to patients. This is known asmonoclonal antibody therapy. Vulnerable NHS patients to be offered new drug These therapies are often reserved for seriously ill patients who are struggling to make their own antibodies. Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche,reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death Sotrovimab, made by GSK,reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults A different monoclonal antibody treatment calledEvushield,external, made by AstraZeneca, is recommended for some vulnerable people to hopefully prevent disease before they show any signs of being infected. This is known as prophylactic therapy. Anti-inflammatories should work against all variants because they target our own bodies, rather than the virus itself. There is more concern about whether monoclonal antibodies would work with new variants, as they rely on being a close match for the virus. If a new variant is heavily mutated then it theoretically makes the drugs weaker. However, GSK says it has tested its therapy against the Omicron variant and it remains effective in laboratory studies. Anti-virals are expected to hold up against the variants seen so far. None of the mutations seen in Omicron should affect the ability of the drugs to work. However, if the drugs are used widely then there is the potential for drug resistance to emerge. A number of drugs have been heralded as potential therapies for Covid - sometimes with no sign that they actually make any difference. Ivermectin has been controversially promoted for use in many parts of the world, despite no evidence that it works. Taking antibodies from survivors' blood - known as convalescent plasma therapy - has been touted, but has not reduced deaths. There was also speculation that drugs used to treat malaria and HIV might work, but this has come to nothing. FollowJameson Twitter,external BOOSTER:Who can get the fourth jab and how do you book it?

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. You can read the full storyhere. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The German economy shrank by 5% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll, according to official figures. The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more. A team from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO)has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to begin its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Fabian Leendertz is a professor in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms at Germanyâs public health institute and will be working with the team in China. He toldBBC World Newsthat these steps are very positive. This video can not be played What is the starting point for WHOâs Wuhan Covid probe? The government says food over the February half term would be provided for children who usually get free school meals by local councils, under theCovid Winter Grant Scheme. But Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, says the government has ""shifted the goal posts"". He told Radio 4's PM that the governmentâs own guidance
on the Covid Winter Grant Scheme explicitly said it ""was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals"". ""The goalposts have just shifted on it, because we
were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.

"Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, a study led by Public Health England shows. Past infection was linked to around a 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. But experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. And officials stress people should follow the stay-at-home rules - whether or not they have had the virus. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, said theresults,externalwere encouraging, suggesting immunity lasted longer than some people feared, but protection was by no means absolute. It was particularly concerning some of those reinfected had high levels of the virus - even without symptoms - and were at risk of passing it on to others, she said. This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said immunity from having Covid-19 is ""not 100% protective"" ""This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others,"" she added. ""Now more than ever, it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives."" Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice? From June to November 2020, almost 21,000 healthcare workers across the UK were regularly tested to see whether they: currently had the coronavirus had had it previously Of those who had no antibodies to the virus, suggesting they may have never had it, 318 developed potential new infections within this timeframe. But among the 6,614 with antibodies, this figure was just 44 potential new infections. Researchers received various different pieces of evidence suggesting these people had become re-infected - including new symptoms more than 90 days after their first infection, new positive swab tests and blood tests. Some tests are still being run and researchers say their results will be updated as they come in. Scientists will continue to monitor the healthcare workers for 12 months to see how long immunity lasts. They will also look closely at cases with the new variant - which was not widespread at the time of this first analysis - and observe the immunity of participants who receive the vaccine. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Dr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, said the results were reassuring for healthcare workers. ""Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity,"" he added. ""We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine. ""So hopefully the results from this paper will reduce the anxiety of many healthcare-worker colleagues who have concerns about getting Covid-19 twice.""

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.

The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more. A team from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO)has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to begin its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.

on the Covid Winter Grant Scheme explicitly said it ""was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals"". ""The goalposts have just shifted on it, because we
were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Six pharmacies will be vaccinating people invited by letter to make an appointment online Some High Street pharmacies in England will start vaccinating people from priority groups on Thursday, with 200 providing jabs in the next two weeks. Six chemists in Halifax, Macclesfield, Widnes, Guildford, Edgware and Telford are the first to offer appointments to those invited by letter. But pharmacists say many more sites should be allowed to give the jab, not just the largest ones. More than 2.6 million people in the UK have now received their first dose. Across the UK, the target is to vaccinate 15 million peoplein the top four priority groups,external- care home residents and workers, NHS frontline staff, the over-70s and the extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February. The vaccines - made by either Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech - are being administered at hospitals, care homes, GP surgeries and vaccination centres. It comes as the UK saw its highest number of daily reported coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began, with the government announcing a further 1,564 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test. On Wednesday evening,the Scottish government published,externalits detailed 16-page plan for rolling out the vaccine, including details of how many vaccines it expects to receive every week until the end of May. Your vaccine questions answered When will you be eligible? Vaccine rumours debunked The first pharmacy sites in England to deliver a vaccine have been chosen because they are capable of delivering large numbers of vaccines quickly while allowing space for social distancing. They are: Boots, Halifax Andrews Pharmacy, Macclesfield Appleton Village Pharmacy, Widnes Superdrug Pharmacy, Guildford Cullimore Chemist, Edgware Woodside Pharmacy, Telford People will be invited by letter to make an appointment at one of the pharmacies, or a vaccination centre, through theNHS Covid-19 vaccination booking service,external. Anyone who doesn't want to travel to these sites can still be vaccinated by their local GP or hospital service, but they may have to wait longer. Up to 70 more pharmacies will be taking bookings for appointments for next week, with 200 in total offering slots over the next fortnight, according to NHS England. Vaccines are currently being offered at more than 1,000 sites, including : 200 hospitals 800 GP-led services seven mass vaccination centres, one in each English region An Asda supermarket in Birminghamwill also host a vaccination centre,with pharmacy staff giving jabs in the store's former clothing section from 25 January. But the National Pharmacy Association says the rules on which pharmacies qualify to deliver Covid vaccines should be relaxed to allow more to take part. How people awaiting vaccines will queue and socially distance in the Halifax store of Boots At present, pharmacies have to be able to deliver 1,000 vaccines a week, have enough fridge space to store all the doses, and be able to open seven days a week. Andrew Lane, of the National Pharmacy Association, said now that the Oxford vaccine had been approved, community pharmacies could store and administer it in the same way as they deliver the flu jab. The Oxford vaccine only needs to be stored at fridge temperature, as opposed to the freezer temperatures of -70C required by Pfizer. ""We're here, we're trained, we will deliver,"" said Mr Lane, who represents Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. NHS England has said that as more supplies of vaccine become available, more community pharmacists will be able to play a role in the programme. The government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said staff across the NHS had ""pulled out all the stops to help ramp up vaccinations"" and were working day and night to keep people safe. Prof Claire Anderson, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's English Pharmacy Board, said pharmacy teams in hospital, primary care and the community were ""working flat out to support the nation's health"". She said she looked forward to the vaccination programme being expanded through pharmacies to benefit patients. Boris Johnsonsaid on Wednesdaythat vaccinations would also start being offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week ""as soon as possible"" - but supply of doses was currently the limiting factor. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters It comes as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising numbers of patients being admitted with Covid. A studypublished today has shownthe impact of packed intensive care units on death rates, finding that patients in England's busiest ICUs in 2020 were 20% more likely to die. Meanwhile, a government committee is meeting later to discuss whether to stop flights from Brazil coming to the UK because of concern about a new variant of the virus believed to have emerged there. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. The strain is one of a small number of new variants which have been spreading, including ones first spotted in the UK and South Africa. Scientists are racing to understand what it means for the vaccines - but most experts think vaccines will still be effective.

"Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter boss Jack Dorsey has said banning US President Donald Trump was the right thing to do. However, he expressed sadness at what he described as the ""extraordinary and untenable circumstances"" surrounding Mr Trump's permanent suspension. He also said the ban was in part a failure of Twitter's, which hadn't done enough to foster ""healthy conversation"" across its platforms. Twitter has been praised and criticised for freezing Mr Trump's account. How 'big tech' is taking Trumpism offline Airbnb cancels DC bookings ahead of inauguration German leader Angela Merkel and Mexican President Andres Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador - neither an ally of the outgoing US president - spoke out against the tech titan's move. In a long Twitter thread, Twitter's chief said he did not celebrate or feel pride in the ban - which came after the Capitol riot last week. Allow Twitter content?

He reiterated that removing the president from Twitter was made after ""a clear warning"" to Mr Trump. ""We made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter,"" Mr Dorsey said. He also accepted that the move would have consequences for an open and free internet. ""Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation.

This video can not be played Police place US Capitol Building on lockdown after Trump supporters breached security lines He also addressed criticism that just a handful of tech bosses can make decisions on who does and doesn't have a voice on the internet - and on accusations of censorship. ""A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same,"" said Mr Dorsey. The decision to remove users, posts and tweets has been criticised by some for violating First Amendment - free speech - rights. However, big tech firms generally argue that as they are private companies, and not state actors, this law does not apply when they moderate their platforms. Facebook and YouTube have taken steps to silence the president, while Amazon shut down Parler, an app widely used by his supporters. Now Snapchat has also announced that Mr Trump will be permanently banned from its platform too. It had already announced an indefinite suspension, but has now decided that ""in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence"" to permanently terminate his account. On Monday, the German chancellor's spokesperson said she found the social media ban ""problematic"". And the Mexican president said: ""I don't like anybody being censored."" Incoming US President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants companies like Facebook and Twitter to do more to take down hate speech and fake news. He has previously said he wants to repeal Section 230, a law protecting social media companies from being sued for the things people post. It's not clear how Mr Biden intends to regulate Big Tech, though it's likely to be a legislative focus of his.

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. You can read the full storyhere. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The German economy shrank by 5% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll, according to official figures. The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more. A team from theWorld Health Organisation (WHO)has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to begin its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Fabian Leendertz is a professor in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms at Germanyâs public health institute and will be working with the team in China. He toldBBC World Newsthat these steps are very positive. This video can not be played What is the starting point for WHOâs Wuhan Covid probe? The government says food over the February half term would be provided for children who usually get free school meals by local councils, under theCovid Winter Grant Scheme. But Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, says the government has ""shifted the goal posts"". He told Radio 4's PM that the governmentâs own guidance
on the Covid Winter Grant Scheme explicitly said it ""was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals"". ""The goalposts have just shifted on it, because we
were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere.

Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.

The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more.

Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.  Tom EspinerBusiness reporter Chairman Charlie Mullins said the firm was ""not putting anyone under any pressure"" but that new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Pimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins saidit was ""a no-brainer"" that workers should get the jab. If they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said. Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Employers ""have a duty"" to support staff who suffer domestic abuse but few have adequate policies in place, the government says. It said bosses were in a unique position to help but a ""lack of awareness and stigma"" held them back. Calls to domestic abuse services have surged in the pandemic as couples spend more time at home. Business Minister Paul Scully said employers could be a ""bridge between a worker and the support they need"". ""It was once taboo to talk about mental health, but now most workplaces have well-established policies in place. We want to see the same happen for domestic abuse, but more quickly and more effectively,"" he said in an open letter to employers. Domestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge Managers and colleagues are often the only other people outside the home that victims talk to each day and so ""uniquely placed"" to spot signs of abuse, he said. These include becoming more withdrawn than usual, sudden drops in performance, mentions of controlling or coercive behaviour in partners, or physical signs such as bruising. Employers did not have to become ""specialists"" in handling domestic abuse, Mr Scully said, but could do more to help, including: Ensuring staff can spot the signs of a colleague facing domestic abuse so they can respond appropriately and sympathetically Communicating that they are there to help, and promoting information about support services Fostering a more open work environment where workers feel able to share problems And offering practical support such as space and privacy to make calls and arrangements or access to financial help. Firms already taking action include Vodafone, which offers specialist training to HR and line managers and support for victims including counselling and additional paid leave. In August, law firm Linklaters strengthened its policies and now offers people who need to flee their home but can't stay with others three nights' accommodation in a hotel. It also offers the option of paid leave, plus one-off payments of Â£5,000 to help victims trying to become financially independent. Domestic violence charity Refuge said it saw an 80% increase in calls to its helpline during the first national lockdown, a trend the government believes has continued. And in November, 43% of respondents to a survey by charity Surviving Economic Abuse showed an abuser had interfered with someone's ability to work or study from home during the crisis. Examples included hiding phones or computers, removing wi-fi connections, and phoning an employer claiming a breach of lockdown rules, in an apparent effort to get them sacked. Domestic abuse isn't a new problem, nor does today's call to businesses apply only during a pandemic. But coronavirus has highlighted new and existing risks. For many victims and survivors, work is a place of respite. Being based at home, or on furlough, can reduce communication with team members, and prevent face-to-face chats with colleagues. I've heard of employers finding simple yet effective ways of supporting staff during the pandemic. For example, finding a plausible reason for an employee whose remote communications were being overlooked, to go into the office as a one-off, so they could talk freely and hand over an ID document for safe keeping. Of course, not every business can afford to offer emergency accommodation or financial support to those in urgent need.  But the focus of today's letter is on awareness, using free support and removing stigma. The charity Surviving Economic Abuse wants the government to go further, and put paid leave for domestic abuse victims into law. Elizabeth Filkin, who chairs the Employer's Initiative on Domestic Abuse, argues there are real benefits in supporting staff - including around productivity, loyalty and reputation. Employment lawyer Sarah Chilton, a partner at CM Murray, told the BBC that all employers have a duty to protect their staff's health and safety while working from home. That includes if they are being subjected to domestic abuse. ""Where an employee is required to work at home during, for example, the pandemic, the employer should take account of any risk to that person's physical and mental health and safety in the environment in which they work."" Angela Ogilvie, global director of HR at Linklaters, said training was vital to spot signs of abuse, especially now. ""Victims may avoid calls or videos for example. They may become quiet, anxious or tearful, secretive about their home life. ""And it's being conscious of how you start those conversations because they may be overheard, so you may have to switch your conversation to email or text."" Mr Scully said the government would consult on ways to help domestic abuse victims at work, for instance by making it easier to request flexible working. The government's Domestic Abuse Bill also continues to make its way through parliament. It will bring into law a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes coercive or controlling behaviour as well as emotional and economic abuse.

Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.

Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.

The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week. Another row began after the government confirmed food will be provided to children in February half term by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools. But councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the grant being used for other support. The letter,externalstates in the first lockdown between March and August, 2.3 million children
experienced food insecurity and during the 2020 summer holidays 850,000 children reported that they
or their families visited a food bank. It urges the prime minister to make sure eligibility for free school meals is equal across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It asks Boris Johnson to look at how to end stigma around free school meals and to give low-income families choice and dignity. The letter also calls for the quality of the food to be monitored and for the cost to be transparent. It says: ""Consider what we have learned
from Covid-19 and its impact on children in low-income
families and the implications of this for school food policy for the
next 5 years, as the country recovers."" Read more The Scottish government has removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after concerns were raised that it contained sensitive information. The document had details about supplies of the vaccine and timescales for when people might be given it. But it has been deleted after the UK government said some of the data should not have been published. The concerns centred on details of how many doses of the vaccine the UK is due to receive. The PA news agency quoted a UK government source as saying: ""The reason we didn't want to publish these figures was because everyone in the world wants these vaccines. ""If other countries see how much we are getting, they are likely to put pressure on the drug firms to give them some of our allocation."" Read more.

were told it wasnât for free school meals and now weâre being told it is. Local
authorities are going to have to reassess their plans,"" he says. ""Food poverty doesnât
just happen at lunchtime and I think one of the key things is that providing an
equivalent of free school meals during the holidays is important but it doesnât
solve food poverty on its own.â By this point in the day we would normally expect to have heard the UK's daily coronavirus figures - on new cases, deaths, hospital admissions and vaccinations. However, the latest update has been delayed due to an ""issue with the processing of deaths data"",the government dashboard says.,external Public Health England has therefore published data,externalon the new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK itself - today's figure is 48,682. That's up on yesterday's figure of 47,525. The seven-day average for daily new cases was, as of yesterday, 53,539. Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London This video can not be played Tube drivers  in London are becoming increasingly concerned at the number of people using the network during the current lockdown. I was sent footage of a busy platform at Canning Town station, in east London, this morning (see above). Transport for London (TfL) says today's overcrowding was because of trains being cancelled due to staff absence, and that incidents like this are not common. But overcrowding incidents during the pandemic have happened before, including earlier this week, and east London is the busiest part of the Tube network first thing with many construction workers who live there needing to travel - legitimately - to sites in central London. TfL is trying to encourage construction companies to stagger their starts. The Tube is running at 20% pre-pandemic passenger levels, but as the government continues to allow building sites to stay open, pinch points remain a big issue. Commuters tell me the Jubilee line was horrendous this morning and action is needed to stop it being repeated. The RMT union for transport workers adds that its members are being put at risk and there should be better crowd management at pinch points.

Employment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business - saying people who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim. The UK is aiming to vaccinate15 million people from priority groups by mid-Februaryas part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19. France has just imposed a 6pm nationwide virus curfew. Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference that the curfew will remain in place for at least 15 days. Most of France was subject to an 8pm curfew imposed in mid-December. From Monday, travellers arriving in France from non-European Union destinations will have to present a negative Covid test less than 72 hours old, the PM also announced. Those returning must self-isolate for seven days. Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than in any other area, official figures show. This compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""hugely concerned"" the capital had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country, despite having ""extremely high"" rates of the virus. However, the prime minister's official spokesman said every area had received ""a fair share"". In total, more than 2.9 million Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England up to yesterday, of which around 2.4 million were first doses, according to provisional NHS England data. Earlier this afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the figure had passed three million. Read more. A new coronavirus variant discovered in four people who had travelled from Brazil's Amazon region to Japan is ""of concern"", a Brazilian expert say. Felipe Naveca, the lead investigator for
the new variant at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said that its origin ""undoubtedly was in Amazon state"". He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that it had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations. ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" The Amazon region is currently seeing a new surge in cases Naveca said that there was not yet any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective on the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question."" As for stopping its spread, Naveca's advice is simple: ""We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve,"" he said, urging people to wear masks and wash their hands. Frontline workers living with 'long Covid' should have access to a compensation scheme if they are unable to return to work, an MP says. Opening a general debate in the Commons on long Covid, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said 300,000 people were believed to already be living with the condition in the UK. New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Exactly one week after security forces with guns drawn defended the House of Representatives against an angry mob, legislators gathered in the same chamber to impeach the president that mob supported. It marked the first time in the 231-year history of the United States that a president has been impeached twice in his term. For a president who likes to boast about the historic successes of his presidency, it is an ignominious ending to his time in office. The single article of impeachment accuses the president of inciting the riot that broke out at the US Capitol after he spoke to a crowd of thousands at a pro-Trump rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. It will now be forwarded to the US Senate, where the 100-member body will once again sit as a jury presided over by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. The outcome of that trial, which will not begin until after Joe Biden's inauguration, is very much in doubt. At this point, however, the political implications for the House's action can begin to be assessed. As it happened: Trump impeachment Just over a year ago, the House of Representatives impeached Trump the first time without a single Republican vote. This time around, 10 members of his own party broke ranks to support the resolution - and more condemned his words and actions on the day of the capitol riot. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, was the most notable defection. ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she wrote in a statement that was frequently quoted by Democrats during the impeachment debate. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? Already there is word that some Republicans in the Senate are open to voting to convict the president of the charges. The New York Times reported on Tuesday night that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was ""pleased"" that Trump was on the verge of being impeached and hoped that the process would allow the party to make a clean break with a president. He has since said he will reserve judgement until the trial is concluded - but such reports from the senator's usually tight-lipped office do not materialise out of thin air. Battle lines within the party, even tentative ones, are being drawn. This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? The split in the House on Wednesday sets up a choice for Republicans in the days ahead. On one hand is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique brand of heat and rhetoric. In the hours after last week's riot, Democrats grappled with how best to respond to - and punish - the president for instigating an attack that, in their view, not only threatened US democracy but also put their lives at risk. In the end, they decided making Trump a twice-impeached president, despite coming in the final week of his presidency, was their most effective move. Democrats on Wednesday were not just impeaching Donald J Trump, however. They were indicting Trumpism as a whole. The impeachment article specifically referenced the months that Trump spent attacking and undermining November's general election. And during debate in the House of Representatives, they attacked Trump's behaviour over the course of his presidency and went after Republicans in Congress who echoed the president's rhetoric. 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol There may be Republicans who want to move on from Trump and Trumpism, but it's clear at least some Democrats in Congress will try to tie the president - and last week's riot - around the neck of the entire Republican Party. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate course of history over the past few months. Donald Trump, instead of vociferously challenging his election defeat, quietly conceded in November. The Republicans would probably have won at least one of the run-off elections in Georgia and would still control the Senate. Trump, instead of facing a very real threat from Republicans eager to bury him, would be a kingmaker for the party. Another presidential run in 2024 would be a very real possibility. Instead, Trump is on the ropes. He's been silenced from social media, including his beloved Twitter account. Even if he is not prohibited from running for office by a Senate conviction, his power and influence within the Republican Party has been dented. What happens to impeached presidents? Public opinion polling, as well as his vocal defenders in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, suggest the president still has a significant well of support within his party. But the past weeks will embolden his adversaries, who sense an opportunity to deliver a lasting knockout to the president while he's down. This video can not be played Republican pollster: 'Three quarters of Trump voters still believe he won' He's at greater risk now than ever before. For five years, Trump has been proving critics and prognosticators who penned his political epitaph wrong. He's survived scandals and controversies that would take down most other politicians. This time, at long last, could be different. Upon taking the oath of office, President-elect Biden will have to contend with a pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 4,000 Americans a day and an economy that is once again worsening. Now he'll have to do so while a Senate grapples with the impeachment trial of his predecessor. Republicans warned on Wednesday that impeachment would further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal. It would, they say, make Biden's promise to unify the nation all the harder. That may end up being the case, although Democrats have been quick to counter that talk of healing rings hollow after Republicans waged a lengthy campaign to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's election. The impeachment trial, however, presents some very real practical challenges for Biden in the early days of his presidency. A Senate preoccupied with the process of passing judgement on Trump is one that will be unable to focus on enacting Biden's ambitious first-100-day agenda. It is also one that may not be able to quickly confirm Biden's administration appointees, limiting his ability to successfully manage the sprawling apparatus of the federal government. Biden has asked whether the Senate could conduct a part-time trial of Trump, working on confirmations and legislation when it is not sitting as a jury for the ex-president. A guide to the inauguration on 20 January There's no guarantees that Republicans or the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian will go along with that plan, however. The first 100 days are a pivotal time for any new president - a moment when his or her political influence is at its highest. At least some of Biden's power will be drained away by this particular fight. Did Trump's words incite the riot? A day that shook America.

"President Donald Trump has just become the only US president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. He was impeached on Wednesday for ""incitement of insurrection"" following last week's riot at the US Capitol. However,a recent poll suggests that a majority of Republicans still support President Trump,externaland don't hold him responsible for the violence. We've been hearing from lawmakers - but what do Americans think? We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in. Belinda is an attorney anddevotedTrump supporter of Native American and African American ancestry. She says this second impeachment vote is wrong and misconstrues the facts of what happened last week in favour of political expediency. This is unprecedented. There is no justification, no legal or constitutional basis for this impeachment. He did not even receive due process. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. I hope the American people will stand up against this outrage. It's indicative of what would happen in a communist country where we have no free speech rights. Those who broke in should be charged appropriately for whatever laws they violated. But why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? His rallies have always been peaceful and most of the people on Wednesday were middle-aged and elderly, with children and grandchildren. Individuals who violated the law should definitely be prosecuted but I don't see how you can blame someone for a speech and someone else's criminal activity. It can't be selective enforcement of the law. Did Trump's words at rally incite a riot? Melissa is a Filipino American small business owner with two children who had told us the country could not afford four more years of Donald Trump. She says the behaviour he displayed last Wednesday was undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. [Republican Congresswoman] Liz Cheney said that, if not for the president, last week would not have happened and she's right. If not for him continually fighting the election results, if not for him repeatedly sending the false message the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about an 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Even three months ago, before all the lawsuits and everything else he was saying, I was not shocked by his behaviour. It's all completely predictable because it's just within his character. So the argument by politicians that impeachment could divide us more, I don't see that as the goal of impeachment. It can't help but I don't think it will have any impact on deterring violence. There needs to be some kind of statement that the president is not allowed to attack another branch of government. It's a chance for the Republican Party to rid itself of Trump's stranglehold on them. Gabriel is a regional coordinator for the New York Young Republicans and is an outspoken 'Latino for Trump'. He condemns the violence of last Wednesday but says the reaction has been unfair and worries about where the party will go from here. I do not think that Donald Trump should be impeached. I was in DC at the rally on 6 January - I did not go near the Capitol and went back to my hotel room - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. This is just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. I fear that people will become reactionary and elected officials will use impeachment in the future not as a last resort to uphold our republic but as a tool to remove whoever they don't agree with. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history and it was not a coup. It's important to dictate that violence is not the answer. The day was supposed to be different. January 6 did something to the Republican Party. The actions of the few will discourage many of the new voters that Trump brought in and made his base. Williams is a first-generation Mexican American college student in Atlanta who has been extremely concerned about what he has seen in his country over the past four years. He says the events of the past week justify today's vote in the House. I believe he should have been impeached. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condemn white supremacy and other threats. That affects us internally within the United States as well as abroad. It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Impeachment failed once, but now he has set the precedent that a president can be impeached more than once. In processing the past week, all I could do at first was to ignore it and joke about the situation. It's deeply saddening to me. Republicans defend - and some attack - Trump.

"The coronavirus growth rate is slowing in the UK and the number of infections is starting to level off in some areas, a top scientist has said. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a ""sign of plateauing"" in cases and hospital admissions. But he warned the overall death toll would exceed 100,000. On Wednesday, the UK sawits biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths. It has taken the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. There were also 47,525 new cases. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thenational lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"", but it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules. People in England are required to stay at homeand only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""much too early"" to say when the number of cases would come down. Patel: No new Covid rules 'today or tomorrow' Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Pharmacies in England start Covid vaccination Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge But he said: ""It looks like in London in particular and a couple of other regions in the South East and East of England, hospital admissions may even have plateaued. ""It has to be said this is not seen everywhere - both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas, but overall at a national level we are seeing the rate of growth slow."" Prof Ferguson added: ""I would hope the hospital admissions might plateauâ¦ sometime in the next week, but hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks."" He warned the overall death toll would be ""well over 100,000"", adding ""there's nothing we can do about that now"". Prof Ferguson added Covid restrictions could be in place for many months to come, adding the new variant's increased transmissibility would mean relaxation of the rules will be a ""gradual process to the autumn"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Thursday that the government will not be introducing tougher social distancing rules ""today or tomorrow"" and insisted that ministers are focusing on increasing enforcement of the current restrictions. Asked about speculation further measures could include a three-metre social distancing rule or a requirement to wear masks outside, she told ITV's This Morning: ""This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures."" Meanwhile, a major study led by Public Health England has shownmost people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the finding ""doesn't eliminate"" the risk of people catching Covid-19 again, and infecting others. She said: ""We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals."" Prof Hopkins said she hoped that after Easter, ""we will start to see reduced infection rates, as we did at that time last year"" and the number of people who have been vaccinated at a ""very high level"". The UK is continuing efforts to ramp up the rollout of the Covid vaccine, with the prime minister saying thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted on Thursday,externalto say that ""three million vaccines have now been administered"" in the UK. On Thursday, NHS England publisheda breakdown of vaccinations by age and region,externalfor the first time.

"The coronavirus growth rate is slowing in the UK and the number of infections is starting to level off in some areas, a top scientist has said. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a ""sign of plateauing"" in cases and hospital admissions. But he warned the overall death toll would exceed 100,000. On Wednesday, the UK sawits biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths. It has taken the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. There were also 47,525 new cases. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thenational lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"", but it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules. People in England are required to stay at homeand only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""much too early"" to say when the number of cases would come down. Patel: No new Covid rules 'today or tomorrow' Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Pharmacies in England start Covid vaccination Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge But he said: ""It looks like in London in particular and a couple of other regions in the South East and East of England, hospital admissions may even have plateaued. ""It has to be said this is not seen everywhere - both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas, but overall at a national level we are seeing the rate of growth slow."" Prof Ferguson added: ""I would hope the hospital admissions might plateauâ¦ sometime in the next week, but hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks."" He warned the overall death toll would be ""well over 100,000"", adding ""there's nothing we can do about that now"". Prof Ferguson added Covid restrictions could be in place for many months to come, adding the new variant's increased transmissibility would mean relaxation of the rules will be a ""gradual process to the autumn"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Thursday that the government will not be introducing tougher social distancing rules ""today or tomorrow"" and insisted that ministers are focusing on increasing enforcement of the current restrictions. Asked about speculation further measures could include a three-metre social distancing rule or a requirement to wear masks outside, she told ITV's This Morning: ""This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures."" Meanwhile, a major study led by Public Health England has shownmost people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the finding ""doesn't eliminate"" the risk of people catching Covid-19 again, and infecting others. She said: ""We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals."" Prof Hopkins said she hoped that after Easter, ""we will start to see reduced infection rates, as we did at that time last year"" and the number of people who have been vaccinated at a ""very high level"". The UK is continuing efforts to ramp up the rollout of the Covid vaccine, with the prime minister saying thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted on Thursday,externalto say that ""three million vaccines have now been administered"" in the UK. On Thursday, NHS England publisheda breakdown of vaccinations by age and region,externalfor the first time. Mr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesdaythat he was ""concerned"" about a new Covid variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil and said that the UK was taking steps to ensure it is not brought into the UK. A Downing Street spokesman said ministers met this morning to discuss ""urgent measures to reduce the potential spread to the UK of the Brazilian variant"". They could includea ban on flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, the Deputy Scottish First Minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast ""the virus is not accelerating as fast as it was"" in Scotland. He said ""there are some early signs of optimism"" but emphasised people should follow all guidance as the ""virus is still at a very strong level"".

"Lucy Edwards, pictured with dog Olga, became BBC Radio 1's first blind presenter when she guested in 2019 A blind social media star said she could be waiting for years for a new guide dog because of delays connected with the Covid-19 pandemic. Lucy Edwards creates videos onliving with sight loss, which have been watched millions of times. The 25-year-old has used a guide dog since she was 17 and said she had lost her independence since her latest dog was retired four months ago. She said it was like losing her ""eyesight all over again"". ""It has really knocked my confidence that in a pandemic I don't have my dog any more,"" Ms Edwards, from Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, said. ""I don't feel comfortable going outside on my own."" Lucy Edwards says she struggles to socially distance using her cane alone, as she does not know where people are around her She now relies on her cane and her sighted partner, but added she found it difficult to socially distance with just a cane and felt ""scared"" without the support of her dog Olga. The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said the pandemic meant it had been forced to stop dog training for five months last year. It said 52 dogs had been trained and become qualified in the Midlands in 2020, compared with 125 in 2019, and added the monthly figures showed a big impact in April. While general dog training iscontinuing during the third England lockdown,external, with social distancing measures in place, some orientation and other work has stopped, along with puppy training classes. West Bromwich marathon runner Dave Heeley,who was appointed an OBE in the New Year Honours, has been waiting for a dog for more than two years. ""The dog is your best friend, your dog is your mobility and I don't feel that from a stick,"" he said. Dave Heeley has been waiting two years for a dog The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said over the past two years it had matched 80% of people with a guide dog within 16 months. The charity currently has about 5,000 guide dogs working in the UK and within the next few years said it was targeting 1,000 new guide dog partnerships a year.

"There are two hand prints above the back of the pig Archaeologists have discovered the world's oldest known animal cave painting in Indonesia - a wild pig - believed to be drawn 45,500 years ago. Painted using dark red ochre pigment, the life-sized picture of the Sulawesi warty pig appears to be part of a narrative scene. The picture was found in the Leang Tedongnge cave in a remote valley on the island of Sulawesi. It provides the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. ""The people who made it were fully modern, they were just like us, they had all of the capacity and the tools to do any painting that they liked,"" said Maxime Aubert, the co-author of the reportpublished in Science Advances journal,external. Animal painting found in cave is 44,000 years old A dating specialist, Mr Aubert had identified a calcite deposit that had formed on top of the painting, and used Uranium-series isotope dating to determine that the deposit was 45,500 years old. There are countless limestone caves in the area - many still to be explored This makes the artwork at least that old. ""But it could be much older because the dating that we're using only dates the calcite on top of it,"" he added. The report says that the painting, which measures 136cm by 54cm (53in by 21in), depicts a pig with horn-like facial warts characteristic of adult males of the species. There are two hand prints above the back of the pig, which also appears to be facing two other pigs that are only partially preserved. High contrast images: The two other warty pigs in the scene are only partially preserved Co-author Adam Brumm said: ""The pig appears to be observing a fight or social interaction between two other warty pigs."" To make the hand prints, the artists would have had to place their hands on a surface before spitting pigment over it, the researchers said. The team hopes to be able to extract DNA samples from the residual saliva as well. The painting may be the world's oldest art depicting a figure, but it is not the oldest human-produced art. In South Africa,a hashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years agois believed to be the oldest known drawing. This video can not be played Cave paintings as old as those found in Europe have been found in Indonesia, raising new questions about early mankind and the development of art in prehistoric times. Jonathan Amos, Science Correspondent Sulawesi is in a key location. It's the largest island in a group that scientists often refer to as Wallacea after the great 19/20th Century naturalist Alfred Wallace. The group sits on a dividing line, either side of which you find very different animals and plants. But Wallacea's significance also is that it must have been a stepping stone for modern humans as they made their way to Australia. We know they were on that landmass some 65,000 years ago, so it's reasonable to assume they were also on Sulawesi at the same time or even earlier. This raises the tantalising prospect of there being figurative art out there, either on Sulawesi or the immediate islands, that's older still than 45,500 years old. The limestone hills about an hour's drive from Makassar have innumerable nooks and crannies, just like the cave at Leang Tedongnge. Stand by for more discoveries.

"People needing to travel by rail during lockdown are being urged to double-check train times, as services are being reduced. Services in England are being cut from 87% of normal levels to 72%, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said. It said the number of trains would reflect the drop in passengers, and provide better value for money for taxpayers who are subsidising services. Peak services will be prioritised to help key workers, it added. While some timetables have already changed, others will be altered in the next few weeks. Since the early days of the pandemic, the government has spent billions of pounds covering the fall in ticket revenues for rail companies, owing to low passenger numbers. Cutting some services will save public money, the government said. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""It is critical that our railways continue to deliver reliable services for key workers and people who cannot reasonably work from home, and that they respond quickly to changes in demand."" Rail usage has slumped, with passenger journeys falling more than 90% to 35 million journeys for the three-month period to June,according to the Office of Rail and Road,external. The figures recovered a little to 134 million for the three months to September - the latest published. With fewer passengers, the government argues, it makes sense to run fewer services. Not least because right now, the government are footing much of the bill; since the start of the pandemic, the government has spent more than Â£4bn covering the fall in ticket revenues because of low passenger numbers. The cuts aren't as deep as they were in March - then services were running around 55% of pre-pandemic levels - which is partly because the train companies want to make sure it doesn't take as long getting the services back up again when they are needed. Longer term, rail companies are nervous about how quickly passengers, particularly commuters, will return, but for now the message is still firmly ""stay at home"". ""Train timetables must still meet the needs of those who have to travel, said Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith. ""Many key workers rely on the first and last services of the day so it's important that these are maintained. Providing enough capacity for those who are travelling to properly social distance remains vital."" Although timetables were restored when restrictions were eased over the summer, rail franchising has since been scrapped and replaced with a model which means the taxpayer is currently liable for the losses on the railways. In September, the bill had run to more than Â£3.5bn - and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support is still needed. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority. You can read the full storyhere. Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The German economy shrank by 5% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll, according to official figures. The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week.

Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People needing to travel by rail during lockdown are being urged to double-check train times, as services are being reduced. Services in England are being cut from 87% of normal levels to 72%, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said. It said the number of trains would reflect the drop in passengers, and provide better value for money for taxpayers who are subsidising services. Peak services will be prioritised to help key workers, it added. While some timetables have already changed, others will be altered in the next few weeks. Since the early days of the pandemic, the government has spent billions of pounds covering the fall in ticket revenues for rail companies, owing to low passenger numbers. Cutting some services will save public money, the government said. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""It is critical that our railways continue to deliver reliable services for key workers and people who cannot reasonably work from home, and that they respond quickly to changes in demand."" Rail usage has slumped, with passenger journeys falling more than 90% to 35 million journeys for the three-month period to June,according to the Office of Rail and Road,external. The figures recovered a little to 134 million for the three months to September - the latest published. With fewer passengers, the government argues, it makes sense to run fewer services. Not least because right now, the government are footing much of the bill; since the start of the pandemic, the government has spent more than Â£4bn covering the fall in ticket revenues because of low passenger numbers. The cuts aren't as deep as they were in March - then services were running around 55% of pre-pandemic levels - which is partly because the train companies want to make sure it doesn't take as long getting the services back up again when they are needed. Longer term, rail companies are nervous about how quickly passengers, particularly commuters, will return, but for now the message is still firmly ""stay at home"". ""Train timetables must still meet the needs of those who have to travel, said Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith. ""Many key workers rely on the first and last services of the day so it's important that these are maintained. Providing enough capacity for those who are travelling to properly social distance remains vital."" Although timetables were restored when restrictions were eased over the summer, rail franchising has since been scrapped and replaced with a model which means the taxpayer is currently liable for the losses on the railways. In September, the bill had run to more than Â£3.5bn - and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support is still needed. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Covid-19 patients in England's busiest intensive care units in 2020 were 20% more likely to die,University College London research has found,external. The increased risk was equivalent to gaining a decade in age. By the end of 2020, one in three hospital trusts in England was running at higher than 85% capacity. Eleven trusts were completely full on 30 December, and the total number of people in intensive care with Covid has continued to rise since then. The link between full ICUs and higher death rates was already known, but this study is the first to measure its effect during the pandemic. Tighter lockdown restrictions are needed to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, says study author Dr Bilal Mateen. Researchers looked at more than 4,000 patients who were admitted to intensive care units in 114 hospital trusts in England between April and June last year. They found the risk of dying was almost a fifth higher in ICUs where more than 85% of beds were occupied, than in those running at between 45% and 85% capacity. That meant a 60-year-old being treated in one of these units had the same risk of dying as a 70-year-old on a quieter ward. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine sets 85% as the maximum safe level of bed occupancy. However, the team found there was no tipping point after which deaths rose - instead, survival rates fell consistently as bed-occupancy increased. This suggests ""a lot of harm is occurring before you get to 85%"". Patients admitted to ICUs that were less than 45% full were 25% less likely to die than average. UK reports record 1,564 daily Covid deaths 'How long can we keep going like this? About a week' Usually if a very sick patient's heart stops, everyone on the ward will rush to help them, Dr Mateen explained. But when there are too many patients, staff's time is inevitably split, so ""it makes sense that the quality of patient care would be sacrificed"", he said. While extra beds and equipment can, and have, been provided through the Nightingale hospitals and the private sector, finding enough qualified staff has been an issue. ""You can't just create an ICU nurse who knows how to operate a mechanical ventilator overnight,"" Dr Mateen told the BBC. These are highly-skilled roles that take years of training and sometimes decades of experience, he added. Instead, a ""robust vaccination programme"" and tighter lockdown restrictions are needed to bring down cases and hospitalisations, he believes. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? Co-author Prof Christina Pagel at UCL added: ""This paper highlights for the first time that putting such strain on ICUs during pandemic peaks does, sadly, mean that that chances of someone dying in intensive care are higher. ""Our work underlines the urgency of both vaccinating vulnerable groups as soon as possible and reducing Covid transmission in the community to relieve pressure on intensive care."" It's difficult to say for sure that fuller ICUs are actually causing more deaths - it's possible that as they get fuller, only the sickest patients are admitted. But Dr Mateen says there was no evidence of rationing - of sick patients being turned away. Even pre-Covid, data suggests larger ICUs had lower death rates - with a 25% increase in bed numbers linked to a corresponding 25% fall in mortality. And the findings are supported by a wealth of evidence from before the pandemic and from around the world.

"Travel from most of South America to the UK is to be banned from tomorrow after the discovery of a new variant in Brazil A total of 4.46 million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November - the highest since records began The government defends its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term, after criticism from a teaching union During the February half term local councils will provide free meals under the government's Covid Winter Grant Scheme The World Health Organization team arrives in Wuhan as China announces its first death in eight months amid a surge in Covid-19 cases Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, says Public Health England Globally, there have been more than 92 million registered Covid cases and almost two million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Suzanne Leigh That's it for now. Today's live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Penny Spiller, Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus updates. We're going to wrap up the live page soon so here's a brief recap of some of today's coronavirus headlines. A ban on travellers to the UK from South Americahas left one family fearing it could leave them stranded abroad for months. The restriction comes into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday amid fears of a new Covid variant identified in Brazil. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days. However many flights have now been cancelled. Jon Den travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could meet their one-year-old daughter Luiza for the first time. The couple, who live in Wolverhampton, are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. ""We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot,"" the 31-year-old says. ""Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? ""My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. ""I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. ""We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" More over-80s have been vaccinated in the North East and Yorkshire than any other area in England, official figures show. These two places have delivered the first dose of vaccine to 46% of over-80s, compared with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England. London Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses. But London has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions. In total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. About 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.

The country's national statistics office said thatmost sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"",externalby the health emergency. Although a sharp decline, many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. It was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%, although that is still less than 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Read more here. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Experts are ""deeply concerned"" that the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""huge impact"" on children's physical activity levels. New figures from Sport England show 65.1% of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year - a decrease of almost 2% compared with the previous 12 months. Almost a third of children (2.3 million) were classed as ""inactive"" as a result of lockdown restrictions, not even doing 30 minutes per day, up by 2.5%. TheActive Lives,externalsurvey showed the pandemic has also heightened existing participation inequalities, with a 9% drop in activity levels by children and young people from a black background. Children from the most affluent families remain the most active. In terms of gender disparities, there was a notable fall in activity among boys, who suffered from the stopping of team sport, while girls retained roughly their same activity levels, adaptingâ¯well to alternative activities such as online fitness classes andâ¯walking.â¯â¯ England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford has joined celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge and written to the prime minister calling for an urgent review of free school meals. The letter has also been signed by
actress Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall along with more than 40 charities and other organisations. The row over free school meals resurfaced when photos were posted on social media of food parcels widely denounced as inadequate. The parcels will be replaced by food vouchers from next week.

New research ""suggests more than half of people who are hospitalised experience ongoing symptoms six months later and the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 10 people who contract Covid at all will still have symptoms three months later,"" she says. The Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Group has already recommended that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected. But Ms Moran called for it to go further. She says: ""This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specific to those living with long Covid who are unable to work."" We've got an explainer on long Covidhere. Joe Biden, here receiving his second dose of the vaccine, wants to speed up the vaccination roll-out US President-elect Joe Biden is due to set out his
plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic â something he said would be his
number one priority upon taking office. Having set a goal of administering 100 million
vaccine shots in his first 100 days, it is thought Mr Biden will initially seek
to expand current vaccination and virus testing capacity to double the current
pace of inoculations. He has also signalled that he may seek to increase
direct payments to individuals, as well as provide aid to small businesses, more
funding for local and state governments, extend some benefits that are due to
expire, and work to reopen schools. Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National
Economic Council, told a Reuters conference this week that the âpresident-elect
feels that we need to move aggressively on both rescue and recoveryâ. Mr Biden has warned that his full agenda could cost
trillions of dollars and is said to be hoping he can get bipartisan support in Congress
for his bill. The US has the highest case and death toll from
Covid-19 in the world, with more than 23 million cases and nearly 385,000
deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. A mother who gave birth 10 days after discovering she was pregnant says she mistook her growing baby bump for lockdown weight gain. Samantha Hicks says she put baby Julia's kicks down to ""not being well"". ""My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant,"" she says. Samantha, from Portishead in Somerset, says her pregnancy was missed even when she was in Southmead Hospital in Bristol with Covid-19 in November. It was only when husband Joe felt Julia kicking against his hand on New Year's Day that she took a pregnancy test that proved positive. Ten days later, Mrs Hicks' contractions began and Julia arrived weighing 7lbs 8oz (3.4kg). You can read all about her surprise arrival and see another cute picturehere. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic. Experts' concerns currently focus on a small number of new variants of coronavirus: There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of them cause more serious illness. The current vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists are confident that they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Even in the worst case scenario, the vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. I've put together aguide of everything you need to knowabout the new variants and what is being done to fight them. Â© 2025 BBC.

"It was initially believed that Covid-19 originated at a market in Wuhan A World Health Organization (WHO) team has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to start its investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. The long-awaited probe comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing. A group of 10 scientists is set to interview people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak. Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in central China in late 2019. The team's arrival on Thursday morning coincides with a resurgence of new coronavirus cases in the north of the country, while life in Wuhan is relatively back to normal. They will undergo two weeks of quarantine before beginning their research, which will rely upon samples and evidence provided by Chinese officials. Team leader Peter Ben Embarek told AFP news agency just before the trip that it ""could be a very long journey before we get a full understanding of what happened"".

"This video can not be played Dr Heather Payne says school drop off and pick-ups created 'social mixing opportunities' in the pandemic. The decision to keep schools closed has hit both pupils and parents across Wales. Most children will now be out of the classroom andlearning from homeuntil at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases. The Welsh Government's decisions on coronavirus are assisted by itsTechnical Advisory Cell,external(TAC), a group of experts who assess all the latest scientific advice on the virus. So what exactly is the official scientific advice when it comes to schools? Dr Heather Payne, a consultant paediatrician and a member of TAC, describes her role as helping to get together the ""best advice"" to inform ministers making decisions. Here she answers some questions. Dr Heather Payne says the new variant meant that schools needed to close ""I think the most important thing is that the overall rates of coronavirus infection were going up. We know now that was due to thisnew variant,"" explained Dr Payne. ""It is coronavirus but it's much more infectious than the original one that we were dealing with last year. That in itself led to changing our advice around the operation of schools."" ""Now it might be tempting to think that children are spreading it in schools,"" she said. ""But when we break down the data we find that actually schools are safe, secure environments for children."" However, Dr Payne acknowledged that keeping schools open had meant there were more opportunities for ""social mixing,"" which may help the virus spread, such as walking to and from school, or attending after-school activities. ""Unfortunately, the advice had to change to moderating the amount of time that people spent in school because it was clear that it was associated with greater rates of infection,"" she said. Most children will learn from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Dr Payne said, despite efforts, scientists were still unable to say for certain where in school environments coronavirus might be passed on. ""I think the problem is that we really don't know, we've asked this question to some of the best scientists in the country,"" she said. ""Even the head of the Office of National Statistics agrees that we just don't have the evidence of where, during the school day, from leaving the house in the morning to getting back in the evening, transmission really takes place."" However, Dr Payne said some areas were riskier than others. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""We know that it's more likely when people are moving around and coming within close contact with each other so that they can have a face-to-face conversation,"" she explained. ""Communal areas, so in the corridors, or just being in large groups in the school. ""We have said that it should be strongly advised that people wear face coverings during that period [between lessons] so that reduces the risk in what are likely to be higher risk areas."" Dr Payne said teachers had also been urged to open classroom windows towards the end of lessons ""so that fresh air can come in and wherever possible."" Dr Payne said advice was for teachers to open classroom windows ""so that fresh air can come in"" ""We are looking at all possibilities,"" explained Dr Payne. ""We have to go back and look at everything."" She said scientists would consider whether schools needed any other measures to be brought in before re-opening, and were continuing to look at issues including Covid testing and face coverings. Schools currently have the choice on whether or not they want to take up testing for pupils when they return. Those that opt in to the roll-out will be given online training for staff. In secondary schools, pupils and staff are currently advised to wear face coverings in all areas outside the classroom. On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government was reviewing its guidance on schools to see how it could ""make those environments even more secure."" She said it was looking at how to reinforce messages on ""safe behaviours"" for things like walking to school, where children might consider sharing ""mobile phones and cans of fizzy drink."" Despite looking at this range of measures, Dr Payne said one of the biggest factors determining when it might be safe to re-open schools was simply whether enough people were sticking to basic rules outside, like social distancing and not mixing with other households. Children under 11 did not previously have to social distance within bubbles - but schools are now largely closed ""There is some really important research that does show that children can have a wide range of symptoms in coronavirus,"" explained Dr Payne, who is also the Welsh Government's consultant paediatrician. However, she said any child would also have one of the two main symptoms of coronavirus alongside anything else. ""They will have one of the core symptoms, the cough, or the fever. What we've always said is that children present in all sorts of different ways."" Dr Payne said it was more common for children to have a fever with coronavirus, but if there was any doubt, people should look to get a test. ""If you're worried about your child, you should get helpful medical advice from the usual routes, so don't suffer in silence,"" she said. ""Don't sit on a child with a temperature, always take advice."" Young children had been allowed to mix with friends during the summer ""Nurseries are a vital part of supporting both children and the economy and allowing people to work,"" said Dr Payne. ""They have not had to restrict their operations, partly because of the intelligence that we're getting. The evidence is that we are not seeing very many cases in nurseries. If that changes as we monitor it, then it's possible that advice might have to change. ""You have to be conscious of any downside of actions to restrict the spread of infection. ""This is the balance that has been arrived at, for the moment."" Q&A: What is the latest Covid advice for children?

"Six pharmacies will be vaccinating people invited by letter to make an appointment online Some High Street pharmacies in England will start vaccinating people from priority groups on Thursday, with 200 providing jabs in the next two weeks. Six chemists in Halifax, Macclesfield, Widnes, Guildford, Edgware and Telford are the first to offer appointments to those invited by letter. But pharmacists say many more sites should be allowed to give the jab, not just the largest ones. More than 2.6 million people in the UK have now received their first dose. Across the UK, the target is to vaccinate 15 million peoplein the top four priority groups,external- care home residents and workers, NHS frontline staff, the over-70s and the extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February. The vaccines - made by either Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech - are being administered at hospitals, care homes, GP surgeries and vaccination centres. It comes as the UK saw its highest number of daily reported coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began, with the government announcing a further 1,564 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test. On Wednesday evening,the Scottish government published,externalits detailed 16-page plan for rolling out the vaccine, including details of how many vaccines it expects to receive every week until the end of May. Your vaccine questions answered When will you be eligible? Vaccine rumours debunked The first pharmacy sites in England to deliver a vaccine have been chosen because they are capable of delivering large numbers of vaccines quickly while allowing space for social distancing. They are: Boots, Halifax Andrews Pharmacy, Macclesfield Appleton Village Pharmacy, Widnes Superdrug Pharmacy, Guildford Cullimore Chemist, Edgware Woodside Pharmacy, Telford People will be invited by letter to make an appointment at one of the pharmacies, or a vaccination centre, through theNHS Covid-19 vaccination booking service,external. Anyone who doesn't want to travel to these sites can still be vaccinated by their local GP or hospital service, but they may have to wait longer. Up to 70 more pharmacies will be taking bookings for appointments for next week, with 200 in total offering slots over the next fortnight, according to NHS England. Vaccines are currently being offered at more than 1,000 sites, including : 200 hospitals 800 GP-led services seven mass vaccination centres, one in each English region An Asda supermarket in Birminghamwill also host a vaccination centre,with pharmacy staff giving jabs in the store's former clothing section from 25 January. But the National Pharmacy Association says the rules on which pharmacies qualify to deliver Covid vaccines should be relaxed to allow more to take part. How people awaiting vaccines will queue and socially distance in the Halifax store of Boots At present, pharmacies have to be able to deliver 1,000 vaccines a week, have enough fridge space to store all the doses, and be able to open seven days a week. Andrew Lane, of the National Pharmacy Association, said now that the Oxford vaccine had been approved, community pharmacies could store and administer it in the same way as they deliver the flu jab. The Oxford vaccine only needs to be stored at fridge temperature, as opposed to the freezer temperatures of -70C required by Pfizer. ""We're here, we're trained, we will deliver,"" said Mr Lane, who represents Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. NHS England has said that as more supplies of vaccine become available, more community pharmacists will be able to play a role in the programme. The government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said staff across the NHS had ""pulled out all the stops to help ramp up vaccinations"" and were working day and night to keep people safe. Prof Claire Anderson, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's English Pharmacy Board, said pharmacy teams in hospital, primary care and the community were ""working flat out to support the nation's health"". She said she looked forward to the vaccination programme being expanded through pharmacies to benefit patients. Boris Johnsonsaid on Wednesdaythat vaccinations would also start being offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week ""as soon as possible"" - but supply of doses was currently the limiting factor.

"Most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, a study led by Public Health England shows. Past infection was linked to around a 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. But experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. And officials stress people should follow the stay-at-home rules - whether or not they have had the virus. Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, said theresults,externalwere encouraging, suggesting immunity lasted longer than some people feared, but protection was by no means absolute. It was particularly concerning some of those reinfected had high levels of the virus - even without symptoms - and were at risk of passing it on to others, she said. This video can not be played Prof Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said immunity from having Covid-19 is ""not 100% protective"" ""This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others,"" she added. ""Now more than ever, it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives."" Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice? From June to November 2020, almost 21,000 healthcare workers across the UK were regularly tested to see whether they: currently had the coronavirus had had it previously Of those who had no antibodies to the virus, suggesting they may have never had it, 318 developed potential new infections within this timeframe. But among the 6,614 with antibodies, this figure was just 44 potential new infections. Researchers received various different pieces of evidence suggesting these people had become re-infected - including new symptoms more than 90 days after their first infection, new positive swab tests and blood tests. Some tests are still being run and researchers say their results will be updated as they come in. Scientists will continue to monitor the healthcare workers for 12 months to see how long immunity lasts. They will also look closely at cases with the new variant - which was not widespread at the time of this first analysis - and observe the immunity of participants who receive the vaccine. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Dr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, said the results were reassuring for healthcare workers. ""Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity,"" he added. ""We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine. ""So hopefully the results from this paper will reduce the anxiety of many healthcare-worker colleagues who have concerns about getting Covid-19 twice.""

"Top Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou has been sent bullets in the mail while under house arrest in Vancouver, according to court testimony. It was one of several alleged death threats revealed on Wednesday by the company providing her security. Ms Meng was detained in 2018 on charges relating to allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's dealings in Iran. Her case has created a rift between China and Canada, with Beijing repeatedly calling for her release. The chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the US, where she is facing charges of bank fraud and potentially causing HSBC to break US sanctions. Days after she was released on bail, she was placed under house arrest in Vancouver. She has been fighting against her extradition to the US, which wants her to stand trial. The hours that led to Meng Wanzhou's arrest Top Huawei executive suffers US extradition blow Possible deal for arrested Huawei finance chief The threats were revealed at the British Columbia Supreme Court by Doug Maynard, chief operating officer of security firm Lions Gate Risk Management. He said Ms Meng received ""five or six"" threatening letters at her residence in June and July 2020 and that the letters were ""easily identifiable by markings on the outside"". He added that ""sometimes there were bullets inside the envelopes"". The role of the Vancouver police and any investigations is unclear. Ms Meng has been in court pushing for conditions of her bail to be loosened, including dropping the daytime security detail that constantly follows her. She is permitted to leave home between 6am and 11pm and pays for a round-the-clock security detail. She also wears a GPS tracking anklet as stipulated by her bail conditions. The government has also granted family members of Ms Meng permission to travel to Canada, sparking controversy. Conservative MP Raquel Dancho said the exception was an ""insult to the millions of Canadians who were told by this government not to visit loved ones"" over the holidays. Allow Twitter content?

She called the move disappointing, noting that Beijing detained two Canadians soon after Ms Meng's arrest in December 2018 and has held them in prison ever since, subjecting them to interrogations. Ms Meng's defence lawyer has argued that Canada is effectively being asked ""to enforce US sanctions"". Huawei has been one of the main targets of the Trump administration's attack on Chinese companies that it deems are security threats and pass data to the government. The US has placed harsh restrictions on Huawei and has banned its 5G equipment from its networks. It also added 38 names linked to Huawei to a trade blacklist. This week Huawei came under firefor technology that identifies people who appear to be of Uighur origin among images of pedestrians. Huawei had previously said none of its technology was designed to identify ethnic groups.

"A provisional 270 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been secured by the African Union (AU) for distribution across the continent. All of the doses will be used this year, promises current AU head South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. This is on top of 600 million doses already promised but is still not enough to vaccinate the whole region. There are fears that poorer countries globally will wait far longer than richer nations to be inoculated. Although infection numbers and death rates are comparatively lower across most of Africa, cases are spiking again in some areas. Anew variant of Covid-19 in South Africais causing particular alarm and makes up most of the new cases. ""As a result of our own efforts we have so far secured a commitment of a provisional amount of 270 million vaccines from three major suppliers: Pfizer, AstraZeneca (through Serum Institute of India) and Johnson & Johnson,"" President Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. At least 50 million of the doses will be available ""for the crucial period of April to June 2021,"" he said. Will any countries get left out in vaccine race? Live tracker: Covid in Africa The places worried they won't get vaccines In addition, the region is expecting around 600 million doses from the global Covax effort which aims to provide vaccines to lower-income countries. But officials are still waiting for details and are now ""happy we have alternative solutions,"" Nicaise Ndembi, senior science adviser for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Preventiontold the AP news agency,external. This video can not be played Covid vaccines in Africa: What you need to know Mr Ramaphosa said officials are worried that the doses from the Covax effort released in the first half of 2021 will only be enough to inoculate health care workers. With a population of 1.3 billion people and each person requiring two vaccine jabs, Africa would need around 2.6 billion doses to eventually vaccinate everyone. ""These endeavours aim to supplement the Covax efforts, and to ensure that as many dosages of vaccine as possible become available throughout Africa as soon as possible,"" he explained. Africa has recorded more than three million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 75,000 deaths. By contrast, the US has reported close to 23 million infections and more than 383,000 fatalities. There has been a global rush to buy vaccines, with richer countries accused of buying up most of the supply. As many had feared, Africa appears to be at the back of the queue to get Covid-19 vaccines. The announcement of 270 million doses by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - who is also the current chair of the African Union - is good news. This is in addition to those secured by the Covax facility, which is led by the World Health Organisation and the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. The facility has secured 600 million doses - enough to vaccinate only a fifth of the continent. But it may be a while before any of them get to the continent. The announcements are agreements to supply vaccines. There is still the actual procurement process that needs to happen. Negotiations are ongoing. Wealthier nations had a head start. They already acquired the bulk of the early doses being produced through advance purchase deals with manufacturers. The race is on to meet that demand. Africa, on the other hand, still faces funding deficits. There are questions also about the continent's readiness to receive the vaccines. Ultra-cold refrigeration is needed for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Countries are working on building their cold chains. But even this is marred by a shortage of funds. So, the continent can only wait. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Employers ""have a duty"" to support staff who suffer domestic abuse but few have adequate policies in place, the government says. It said bosses were in a unique position to help but a ""lack of awareness and stigma"" held them back. Calls to domestic abuse services have surged in the pandemic as couples spend more time at home. Business Minister Paul Scully said employers could be a ""bridge between a worker and the support they need"". ""It was once taboo to talk about mental health, but now most workplaces have well-established policies in place. We want to see the same happen for domestic abuse, but more quickly and more effectively,"" he said in an open letter to employers. Domestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge Managers and colleagues are often the only other people outside the home that victims talk to each day and so ""uniquely placed"" to spot signs of abuse, he said. These include becoming more withdrawn than usual, sudden drops in performance, mentions of controlling or coercive behaviour in partners, or physical signs such as bruising. Employers did not have to become ""specialists"" in handling domestic abuse, Mr Scully said, but could do more to help, including: Ensuring staff can spot the signs of a colleague facing domestic abuse so they can respond appropriately and sympathetically Communicating that they are there to help, and promoting information about support services Fostering a more open work environment where workers feel able to share problems And offering practical support such as space and privacy to make calls and arrangements or access to financial help. Firms already taking action include Vodafone, which offers specialist training to HR and line managers and support for victims including counselling and additional paid leave. In August, law firm Linklaters strengthened its policies and now offers people who need to flee their home but can't stay with others three nights' accommodation in a hotel. It also offers the option of paid leave, plus one-off payments of Â£5,000 to help victims trying to become financially independent. Domestic violence charity Refuge said it saw an 80% increase in calls to its helpline during the first national lockdown, a trend the government believes has continued. And in November, 43% of respondents to a survey by charity Surviving Economic Abuse showed an abuser had interfered with someone's ability to work or study from home during the crisis. Examples included hiding phones or computers, removing wi-fi connections, and phoning an employer claiming a breach of lockdown rules, in an apparent effort to get them sacked. Domestic abuse isn't a new problem, nor does today's call to businesses apply only during a pandemic. But coronavirus has highlighted new and existing risks. For many victims and survivors, work is a place of respite. Being based at home, or on furlough, can reduce communication with team members, and prevent face-to-face chats with colleagues. I've heard of employers finding simple yet effective ways of supporting staff during the pandemic. For example, finding a plausible reason for an employee whose remote communications were being overlooked, to go into the office as a one-off, so they could talk freely and hand over an ID document for safe keeping. Of course, not every business can afford to offer emergency accommodation or financial support to those in urgent need.  But the focus of today's letter is on awareness, using free support and removing stigma. The charity Surviving Economic Abuse wants the government to go further, and put paid leave for domestic abuse victims into law. Elizabeth Filkin, who chairs the Employer's Initiative on Domestic Abuse, argues there are real benefits in supporting staff - including around productivity, loyalty and reputation. Employment lawyer Sarah Chilton, a partner at CM Murray, told the BBC that all employers have a duty to protect their staff's health and safety while working from home. That includes if they are being subjected to domestic abuse. ""Where an employee is required to work at home during, for example, the pandemic, the employer should take account of any risk to that person's physical and mental health and safety in the environment in which they work."" Angela Ogilvie, global director of HR at Linklaters, said training was vital to spot signs of abuse, especially now. ""Victims may avoid calls or videos for example. They may become quiet, anxious or tearful, secretive about their home life. ""And it's being conscious of how you start those conversations because they may be overheard, so you may have to switch your conversation to email or text."" Mr Scully said the government would consult on ways to help domestic abuse victims at work, for instance by making it easier to request flexible working. The government's Domestic Abuse Bill also continues to make its way through parliament. It will bring into law a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes coercive or controlling behaviour as well as emotional and economic abuse.

"There are two hand prints above the back of the pig Archaeologists have discovered the world's oldest known animal cave painting in Indonesia - a wild pig - believed to be drawn 45,500 years ago. Painted using dark red ochre pigment, the life-sized picture of the Sulawesi warty pig appears to be part of a narrative scene. The picture was found in the Leang Tedongnge cave in a remote valley on the island of Sulawesi. It provides the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. ""The people who made it were fully modern, they were just like us, they had all of the capacity and the tools to do any painting that they liked,"" said Maxime Aubert, the co-author of the reportpublished in Science Advances journal,external. Animal painting found in cave is 44,000 years old A dating specialist, Mr Aubert had identified a calcite deposit that had formed on top of the painting, and used Uranium-series isotope dating to determine that the deposit was 45,500 years old. There are countless limestone caves in the area - many still to be explored This makes the artwork at least that old. ""But it could be much older because the dating that we're using only dates the calcite on top of it,"" he added. The report says that the painting, which measures 136cm by 54cm (53in by 21in), depicts a pig with horn-like facial warts characteristic of adult males of the species. There are two hand prints above the back of the pig, which also appears to be facing two other pigs that are only partially preserved. High contrast images: The two other warty pigs in the scene are only partially preserved Co-author Adam Brumm said: ""The pig appears to be observing a fight or social interaction between two other warty pigs."" To make the hand prints, the artists would have had to place their hands on a surface before spitting pigment over it, the researchers said. The team hopes to be able to extract DNA samples from the residual saliva as well. The painting may be the world's oldest art depicting a figure, but it is not the oldest human-produced art. In South Africa,a hashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years agois believed to be the oldest known drawing. This video can not be played Cave paintings as old as those found in Europe have been found in Indonesia, raising new questions about early mankind and the development of art in prehistoric times. Jonathan Amos, Science Correspondent Sulawesi is in a key location. It's the largest island in a group that scientists often refer to as Wallacea after the great 19/20th Century naturalist Alfred Wallace. The group sits on a dividing line, either side of which you find very different animals and plants. But Wallacea's significance also is that it must have been a stepping stone for modern humans as they made their way to Australia. We know they were on that landmass some 65,000 years ago, so it's reasonable to assume they were also on Sulawesi at the same time or even earlier. This raises the tantalising prospect of there being figurative art out there, either on Sulawesi or the immediate islands, that's older still than 45,500 years old. The limestone hills about an hour's drive from Makassar have innumerable nooks and crannies, just like the cave at Leang Tedongnge. Stand by for more discoveries. The expectation is that even older paintings will be discovered Animal painting found in cave is 44,000 years old 40,000-year old cave art discovered.

"It was not always possible to maintain social distance in the voter queues The internet is blocked and security has been stepped up in Uganda as counting gets under way after polls closed in a hotly contested election. A 38-year-old singer is challenging Yoweri Museveni, 76, in one of the world's youngest countries. Robert Kyagulanyi, known by his stage name Bobi Wine, says he represents the younger generation, while Mr Museveni says he is standing for stability. Dozens of people have been killed in the run-up to the election. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The pop star, the president and a Covid crackdown Why 35 years in power isn't enough for this man The 'ghetto president' aiming for the real thing Polls closed at 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) but remain open for those still queuing at the time. Some voters have stayed to watch the count Some polling stations did not open for close to two hours and voters in the queue had grown angry and had started shouting at the polling gate officials as the cause of the delay was not clear, the BBC's Patience Atuhaire reports from the capital, Kampala. As vote counting began, lorries carrying soldiers drove through the city and police and local defence units were also seen patrolling, she says. Twenty-six people from a coalition of civil society groups have been arrested for allegedly manning an illegal vote-tallying centre at a hotel in the capital. Ahead of the vote, the electoral commission banned the setting up of alternative polling centres. Earlier, the police said they intended to deploy officers on rooftops of Kampala during the election period, saying that opposition activists commanded protests from high-rise building in November, when more than 50 people were killed after Bobi Wine was arrested. Dressed in military fatigues, Mr Museveni gave a stark warning during a televised speech on Tuesday evening: ""If you try to disturb peace, you will have yourself to blame. The security forces, following the law, are ready to deal with any troublemaker."" Results are not expected before Saturday. As well as being unable to get online, people are even having trouble sending text messages. Earlier in the week the authorities ordered the blocking of social media, messaging apps and certain sites for virtual private networks (VPNs) which people use to get around social media blocks. The Ugandan authorities appear to have ordered internet providers to shut down the whole internet at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on the eve of the election,according to a letter shared by journalist Samira Sawlani,external. In the letter, which we have not verified, the Uganda Communications Commission orders internet providers to ""implement a temporary suspension of the operation of all your internet gateways and associated access points"". While it said the order was temporary, the letter did not state when the suspension should end. The internet access advocacy group Access Now has urged telecoms providers to challenge the order, saying they should be ""enablers of human rights, not gatekeepers,external"". Which African states have shut down the internet? By Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala Coronavirus guidelines on social distancing and handwashing are proving hard to implement but here in Kibuli, which sits in the shadow of downtown Kampala, everyone queuing up is wearing facemasks. This video can not be played Ugandan voters: We want peace There are reports that a new biometric system to verify people's identities is not working in some areas. The electoral commission's spokesperson would not confirm whether this was because the internet has been cut off. There are questions about how results from around the country will be transmitted to the national tally centre in Kampala without the internet. The electoral commission told the BBC it has systems in place to do this but didn't explain further. How bad was the violence during the campaign? Violence has been at an unprecedented level. Armed police have been patrolling the streets of Kampala Security forces cracked down on gatherings ahead of the election and dozens have been killed. The government says the ban on gatherings was to prevent the spread of coronavirus while the opposition say it was a smokescreen for repression. Bobi Wine and others out of the 10 opposition candidates have been arrested on several occasions. It depends who you ask. The government has previously said the election would be free and fair. But the US cast doubt over the electoral process and withdrew its election observers after most of its accreditation requests were denied. In response, Mr Museveni's spokesmanDon Wanyama tweeted,externalthat there were observers from the African Union and East African Community. ""I don't remember when Uganda last sent election observers to the US,"" he added. Bobi Wine has called on voters to remain at polling stations on Thursday and use their mobile phone cameras to record the tallying process in an effort to prevent vote rigging. Mr Museveni is standing for a sixth elected term in office, as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM). He came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986 and has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer. But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and side-lining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire. Why 35 years in power isn't enough for this man Bobi Wine is widely thought to be the strongest of the 10 opposition candidates in the presidential race. The 38-year-old reggae star is known by his supporters as the ghetto president. His party, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party campaigns for basic needs like improving access to healthcare, education, clean water and justice. Over the last two decades Bobi Wine's musical output has been filled with songs about these issues and they have inspired a fervent following.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Exactly one week after security forces with guns drawn defended the House of Representatives against an angry mob, legislators gathered in the same chamber to impeach the president that mob supported. It marked the first time in the 231-year history of the United States that a president has been impeached twice in his term. For a president who likes to boast about the historic successes of his presidency, it is an ignominious ending to his time in office. The single article of impeachment accuses the president of inciting the riot that broke out at the US Capitol after he spoke to a crowd of thousands at a pro-Trump rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. It will now be forwarded to the US Senate, where the 100-member body will once again sit as a jury presided over by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. The outcome of that trial, which will not begin until after Joe Biden's inauguration, is very much in doubt. At this point, however, the political implications for the House's action can begin to be assessed. As it happened: Trump impeachment Just over a year ago, the House of Representatives impeached Trump the first time without a single Republican vote. This time around, 10 members of his own party broke ranks to support the resolution - and more condemned his words and actions on the day of the capitol riot. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, was the most notable defection. ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she wrote in a statement that was frequently quoted by Democrats during the impeachment debate. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? Already there is word that some Republicans in the Senate are open to voting to convict the president of the charges. The New York Times reported on Tuesday night that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was ""pleased"" that Trump was on the verge of being impeached and hoped that the process would allow the party to make a clean break with a president. He has since said he will reserve judgement until the trial is concluded - but such reports from the senator's usually tight-lipped office do not materialise out of thin air. Battle lines within the party, even tentative ones, are being drawn. This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? The split in the House on Wednesday sets up a choice for Republicans in the days ahead. On one hand is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique brand of heat and rhetoric. In the hours after last week's riot, Democrats grappled with how best to respond to - and punish - the president for instigating an attack that, in their view, not only threatened US democracy but also put their lives at risk. In the end, they decided making Trump a twice-impeached president, despite coming in the final week of his presidency, was their most effective move. Democrats on Wednesday were not just impeaching Donald J Trump, however. They were indicting Trumpism as a whole. The impeachment article specifically referenced the months that Trump spent attacking and undermining November's general election. And during debate in the House of Representatives, they attacked Trump's behaviour over the course of his presidency and went after Republicans in Congress who echoed the president's rhetoric. 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol There may be Republicans who want to move on from Trump and Trumpism, but it's clear at least some Democrats in Congress will try to tie the president - and last week's riot - around the neck of the entire Republican Party. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate course of history over the past few months. Donald Trump, instead of vociferously challenging his election defeat, quietly conceded in November. The Republicans would probably have won at least one of the run-off elections in Georgia and would still control the Senate. Trump, instead of facing a very real threat from Republicans eager to bury him, would be a kingmaker for the party. Another presidential run in 2024 would be a very real possibility. Instead, Trump is on the ropes. He's been silenced from social media, including his beloved Twitter account. Even if he is not prohibited from running for office by a Senate conviction, his power and influence within the Republican Party has been dented. What happens to impeached presidents? Public opinion polling, as well as his vocal defenders in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, suggest the president still has a significant well of support within his party. But the past weeks will embolden his adversaries, who sense an opportunity to deliver a lasting knockout to the president while he's down. This video can not be played Republican pollster: 'Three quarters of Trump voters still believe he won' He's at greater risk now than ever before. For five years, Trump has been proving critics and prognosticators who penned his political epitaph wrong. He's survived scandals and controversies that would take down most other politicians. This time, at long last, could be different. Upon taking the oath of office, President-elect Biden will have to contend with a pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 4,000 Americans a day and an economy that is once again worsening. Now he'll have to do so while a Senate grapples with the impeachment trial of his predecessor. Republicans warned on Wednesday that impeachment would further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal. It would, they say, make Biden's promise to unify the nation all the harder. That may end up being the case, although Democrats have been quick to counter that talk of healing rings hollow after Republicans waged a lengthy campaign to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's election. The impeachment trial, however, presents some very real practical challenges for Biden in the early days of his presidency. A Senate preoccupied with the process of passing judgement on Trump is one that will be unable to focus on enacting Biden's ambitious first-100-day agenda. It is also one that may not be able to quickly confirm Biden's administration appointees, limiting his ability to successfully manage the sprawling apparatus of the federal government. Biden has asked whether the Senate could conduct a part-time trial of Trump, working on confirmations and legislation when it is not sitting as a jury for the ex-president. A guide to the inauguration on 20 January There's no guarantees that Republicans or the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian will go along with that plan, however. The first 100 days are a pivotal time for any new president - a moment when his or her political influence is at its highest. At least some of Biden's power will be drained away by this particular fight. Did Trump's words incite the riot? A day that shook America.

"The government must review its strategy to end rough sleeping in England by 2024 after coronavirus showed it to be ""out of step"", a watchdog warned. A National Audit Office report praised the 'Everyone In' scheme, which housed about 33,000 people in the crisis. But the plan highlighted issues with the current strategy - with thousands more needing help than expected. The government said it was ""regularly taking into account the lessons learned"" from the pandemic. All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' Five times more sleep rough than official figures UK 'faces period of destitution', warns Casey Boris Johnson made the pledge to end rough sleeping by the end of this Parliament shortly before he won the general election in 2019. At the time, a snapshot figure taken by the government one evening showed 4,266 people were sleeping on the streets in England. But it did not include people in night shelters or assessment centres, and could have missed people sleeping hidden from view. Research by the BBC carried out in February 2020 showed more than 28,000 people across the UK had been recorded as sleeping rough in the previous 12 months - and in England, councils were seeing figures five times higher than the snapshot. The 'Everyone In' scheme, launched in March 2020, aimed to provide emergency shelter for all rough sleepers during the first wave of the pandemic. Funding was ended two months later to the anger of many charities, but the government said it had made a number of more targeted funding pledges to tackle the issue since. The National Audit Office (NAO) carried out an investigation into the housing of rough sleepers in the pandemic and praised the ""considerable achievement"" of 'Everyone In'. The head of the watchdog, Gareth Davies, said the government ""acted swiftly to house rough sleepers and keep transmission rates low during the first wave"". But the NAO investigation found between the end of March and November 2020, 33,139 people were given accommodation through the scheme - a number almost eight times greater than the annual snapshot of rough sleepers. Examples included Bristol City Council which reported it accommodated 400 people in March, despite its most recent snapshot count being 98 rough sleepers. And the London Borough of Southwark had 25 known rough sleepers in March 2020, but within hours of 'Everyone In' launching, it had taken 200 people into hotels, with nearly 1,000 accommodated by November. This video can not be played How the UK's homeless are coping during the coronavirus pandemic The government pledged to carry out a review of its strategy to end rough sleeping early in 2020, but the plans took a back seat as the crisis unfolded. The NAO said there was ""an ongoing need for a review of the strategy as it is out of step with the government's target"", adding there were now ""important lessons from Everyone In to consider"". Mr Davies said the scale of the rough sleeping population in England has now been made clear, and it ""far exceeds"" previous government estimates. ""Understanding the size of this population, and who needs specialist support, is essential to achieve its ambition to end rough sleeping"", he added. The report also highlighted the large number of people remaining in emergency accommodation unable to move on as they have no recourse to public funds - a condition put into the residence permit of some immigrants meaning they cannot access benefits. The NAO also called on the government to ""keep under close review"" its more targeted response to the current coronavirus resurgence, whether it will ""protect vulnerable individuals as decisively"" as 'Everyone in'. A spokesman from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they were pleased the NAO recognised its achievements with 'Everyone In'. He added: ""By November, we had supported around 33,000 people, with nearly 10,000 in emergency accommodation and more than 23,000 in longer-term accommodation. ""We recently announced an additional Â£10m to help accommodate rough sleepers and ensure they are registered with a GP to receive the vaccine, and we will invest Â£750m next year as part of our commitment to end rough sleeping."" Asked whether the review into the ending rough sleeping strategy would take place, the spokesman said: ""Our ambition to end rough sleeping within this parliament still stands, and we are regularly taking into account the lessons learned from our ongoing pandemic response, including 'Everyone In'.""

"A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. And the prime minister warned there was a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care capacity being ""overtopped"". Speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"". He appealed to the public to follow lockdown rules, which require people in England to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A further 47,525 new caseshave also been recorded.,external Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected three or so weeks ago, around Christmas time. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this being reported. Today's figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays in reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 1,000 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There have been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnsonsaid lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions in England, asking why they were weaker in this lockdown compared with March. During the first lockdown, nurseries were closed to most children and it was not permitted to exercise with someone from another household. ""We keep things under constant review,"" Mr Johnson replied. ""If there is any need to toughen up restrictions - which I don't rule out - we will of course come to this House."" He stressed that it was early days, but said: ""The lockdown measures we have in place combined with tier four measures that we were using are starting to show signs of some effect."" PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Deputy chief medical officer gives out Covid jabs Later, asked by the Commons Liaison Committee whether schools could reopen after February half-term, Mr Johnson said: ""It is far, far too early for us to say [early signs of progress mean] we can go into any kind of relaxation in the middle of February, we've got to work very hard to achieve that."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson took questions from MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee The prime minister also said on Wednesday thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. The number of people in the UK who have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,639,309 - up by 207,661 from the day before. Commenting on the latest daily figures, PHE's Dr Doyle said: ""With each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus."" She added: ""It is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus."" The vast majority of the deaths reported on Tuesday happened over the past week. However, at least 100 were in 2020, with one death dating back to May. The previous highest daily death toll was on Friday,when 1,325 people were reported to have died. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. When all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate are counted, plus deaths known to have occurred more recently, the number of deaths involving Covid in the UK is more than 100,000. Another method is to count excess deaths - all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year. This video can not be played Johnson: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see the import of this new variant"". Meanwhile, the prime minister has said he is ""concerned"" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it is not yet clear how effective existing vaccines will be against the latest new variant. The UK is taking steps to make sure it is not brought into the country, Mr Johnson said. A government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. And from Monday,anyone arriving into the UK from any countrywill have to present a negative Covid test. The new rule had been due to come into force this week but the government said it was being put back to give travellers more time to prepare. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"President Donald Trump has just become the only US president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. He was impeached on Wednesday for ""incitement of insurrection"" following last week's riot at the US Capitol. However,a recent poll suggests that a majority of Republicans still support President Trump,externaland don't hold him responsible for the violence. We've been hearing from lawmakers - but what do Americans think? We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in. Belinda is an attorney anddevotedTrump supporter of Native American and African American ancestry. She says this second impeachment vote is wrong and misconstrues the facts of what happened last week in favour of political expediency. This is unprecedented. There is no justification, no legal or constitutional basis for this impeachment. He did not even receive due process. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. I hope the American people will stand up against this outrage. It's indicative of what would happen in a communist country where we have no free speech rights. Those who broke in should be charged appropriately for whatever laws they violated. But why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? His rallies have always been peaceful and most of the people on Wednesday were middle-aged and elderly, with children and grandchildren. Individuals who violated the law should definitely be prosecuted but I don't see how you can blame someone for a speech and someone else's criminal activity. It can't be selective enforcement of the law. Did Trump's words at rally incite a riot? Melissa is a Filipino American small business owner with two children who had told us the country could not afford four more years of Donald Trump. She says the behaviour he displayed last Wednesday was undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. [Republican Congresswoman] Liz Cheney said that, if not for the president, last week would not have happened and she's right. If not for him continually fighting the election results, if not for him repeatedly sending the false message the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about an 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Even three months ago, before all the lawsuits and everything else he was saying, I was not shocked by his behaviour. It's all completely predictable because it's just within his character. So the argument by politicians that impeachment could divide us more, I don't see that as the goal of impeachment. It can't help but I don't think it will have any impact on deterring violence. There needs to be some kind of statement that the president is not allowed to attack another branch of government. It's a chance for the Republican Party to rid itself of Trump's stranglehold on them. Gabriel is a regional coordinator for the New York Young Republicans and is an outspoken 'Latino for Trump'. He condemns the violence of last Wednesday but says the reaction has been unfair and worries about where the party will go from here. I do not think that Donald Trump should be impeached. I was in DC at the rally on 6 January - I did not go near the Capitol and went back to my hotel room - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. This is just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. I fear that people will become reactionary and elected officials will use impeachment in the future not as a last resort to uphold our republic but as a tool to remove whoever they don't agree with. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history and it was not a coup. It's important to dictate that violence is not the answer. The day was supposed to be different. January 6 did something to the Republican Party. The actions of the few will discourage many of the new voters that Trump brought in and made his base. Williams is a first-generation Mexican American college student in Atlanta who has been extremely concerned about what he has seen in his country over the past four years. He says the events of the past week justify today's vote in the House. I believe he should have been impeached. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condemn white supremacy and other threats. That affects us internally within the United States as well as abroad. It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Impeachment failed once, but now he has set the precedent that a president can be impeached more than once. In processing the past week, all I could do at first was to ignore it and joke about the situation. It's deeply saddening to me. Republicans defend - and some attack - Trump.

"Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will now be required for everyone travelling to England from 04:00 GMT on Monday. The rules had been due to come into force on Friday, but the government said people needed time ""to prepare"". Those arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. Anyone arriving from places not on the UK's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. The Scottish government is planning to impose the same rules and has had to defer them coming into effect as a result of changes in England. ""This meant Scotland was also obliged to delay implementation as we need sight of their final regulations in order to properly draft and approve the relevant Scottish regulations,"" a spokeswoman said. It is expected the requirement will come into force in Scotland at 04:00 GMT on Monday as well. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce plans for pre-arrival testing in the coming days. Who needs a negative test to travel to the UK? Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Announcing the deferral on Twitter,Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said:,external""To give international arrivals time to prepare, passengers will be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test before departure to England from Monday 18 January at 4am."" He also reminded travellers to fill out thePassenger Locator Form,external- used in track and trace - and added that those without proof of a negative test faced a fine of Â£500. Problems with testing availability and capacity mean some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda until 04:00 GMT on 21 January. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently. Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. The government has said all forms of PCR test will be accepted, as will other forms of test with ""97% specificity, 80% sensitivity"".

"Six pharmacies will be vaccinating people invited by letter to make an appointment online Some High Street pharmacies in England will start vaccinating people from priority groups on Thursday, with 200 providing jabs in the next two weeks. Six chemists in Halifax, Macclesfield, Widnes, Guildford, Edgware and Telford are the first to offer appointments to those invited by letter. But pharmacists say many more sites should be allowed to give the jab, not just the largest ones. More than 2.6 million people in the UK have now received their first dose. Across the UK, the target is to vaccinate 15 million peoplein the top four priority groups,external- care home residents and workers, NHS frontline staff, the over-70s and the extremely clinically vulnerable - by mid-February. The vaccines - made by either Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech - are being administered at hospitals, care homes, GP surgeries and vaccination centres. It comes as the UK saw its highest number of daily reported coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began, with the government announcing a further 1,564 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test. On Wednesday evening,the Scottish government published,externalits detailed 16-page plan for rolling out the vaccine, including details of how many vaccines it expects to receive every week until the end of May. Your vaccine questions answered When will you be eligible? Vaccine rumours debunked The first pharmacy sites in England to deliver a vaccine have been chosen because they are capable of delivering large numbers of vaccines quickly while allowing space for social distancing. They are: Boots, Halifax Andrews Pharmacy, Macclesfield Appleton Village Pharmacy, Widnes Superdrug Pharmacy, Guildford Cullimore Chemist, Edgware Woodside Pharmacy, Telford People will be invited by letter to make an appointment at one of the pharmacies, or a vaccination centre, through theNHS Covid-19 vaccination booking service,external. Anyone who doesn't want to travel to these sites can still be vaccinated by their local GP or hospital service, but they may have to wait longer. Up to 70 more pharmacies will be taking bookings for appointments for next week, with 200 in total offering slots over the next fortnight, according to NHS England. Vaccines are currently being offered at more than 1,000 sites, including : 200 hospitals 800 GP-led services seven mass vaccination centres, one in each English region An Asda supermarket in Birminghamwill also host a vaccination centre,with pharmacy staff giving jabs in the store's former clothing section from 25 January. But the National Pharmacy Association says the rules on which pharmacies qualify to deliver Covid vaccines should be relaxed to allow more to take part. How people awaiting vaccines will queue and socially distance in the Halifax store of Boots At present, pharmacies have to be able to deliver 1,000 vaccines a week, have enough fridge space to store all the doses, and be able to open seven days a week. Andrew Lane, of the National Pharmacy Association, said now that the Oxford vaccine had been approved, community pharmacies could store and administer it in the same way as they deliver the flu jab. The Oxford vaccine only needs to be stored at fridge temperature, as opposed to the freezer temperatures of -70C required by Pfizer. ""We're here, we're trained, we will deliver,"" said Mr Lane, who represents Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. NHS England has said that as more supplies of vaccine become available, more community pharmacists will be able to play a role in the programme. The government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said staff across the NHS had ""pulled out all the stops to help ramp up vaccinations"" and were working day and night to keep people safe. Prof Claire Anderson, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's English Pharmacy Board, said pharmacy teams in hospital, primary care and the community were ""working flat out to support the nation's health"". She said she looked forward to the vaccination programme being expanded through pharmacies to benefit patients. Boris Johnsonsaid on Wednesdaythat vaccinations would also start being offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week ""as soon as possible"" - but supply of doses was currently the limiting factor.

It comes as the UK saw its highest number of daily reported coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began, with the government announcing a further 1,564 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test. On Wednesday evening,the Scottish government published,externalits detailed 16-page plan for rolling out the vaccine, including details of how many vaccines it expects to receive every week until the end of May. Your vaccine questions answered When will you be eligible? Vaccine rumours debunked The first pharmacy sites in England to deliver a vaccine have been chosen because they are capable of delivering large numbers of vaccines quickly while allowing space for social distancing. They are: Boots, Halifax Andrews Pharmacy, Macclesfield Appleton Village Pharmacy, Widnes Superdrug Pharmacy, Guildford Cullimore Chemist, Edgware Woodside Pharmacy, Telford People will be invited by letter to make an appointment at one of the pharmacies, or a vaccination centre, through theNHS Covid-19 vaccination booking service,external. Anyone who doesn't want to travel to these sites can still be vaccinated by their local GP or hospital service, but they may have to wait longer. Up to 70 more pharmacies will be taking bookings for appointments for next week, with 200 in total offering slots over the next fortnight, according to NHS England. Vaccines are currently being offered at more than 1,000 sites, including : 200 hospitals 800 GP-led services seven mass vaccination centres, one in each English region An Asda supermarket in Birminghamwill also host a vaccination centre,with pharmacy staff giving jabs in the store's former clothing section from 25 January. But the National Pharmacy Association says the rules on which pharmacies qualify to deliver Covid vaccines should be relaxed to allow more to take part. How people awaiting vaccines will queue and socially distance in the Halifax store of Boots At present, pharmacies have to be able to deliver 1,000 vaccines a week, have enough fridge space to store all the doses, and be able to open seven days a week. Andrew Lane, of the National Pharmacy Association, said now that the Oxford vaccine had been approved, community pharmacies could store and administer it in the same way as they deliver the flu jab. The Oxford vaccine only needs to be stored at fridge temperature, as opposed to the freezer temperatures of -70C required by Pfizer. ""We're here, we're trained, we will deliver,"" said Mr Lane, who represents Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. NHS England has said that as more supplies of vaccine become available, more community pharmacists will be able to play a role in the programme. The government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said staff across the NHS had ""pulled out all the stops to help ramp up vaccinations"" and were working day and night to keep people safe. Prof Claire Anderson, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's English Pharmacy Board, said pharmacy teams in hospital, primary care and the community were ""working flat out to support the nation's health"". She said she looked forward to the vaccination programme being expanded through pharmacies to benefit patients. Boris Johnsonsaid on Wednesdaythat vaccinations would also start being offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week ""as soon as possible"" - but supply of doses was currently the limiting factor.

"Donald Trump has been impeached for ""inciting"" the deadly riot at the US Capitol Ten rebel Republicans voted with Democrats after a day of debate in the House of RepresentativesÂ It makes Trump the first president ever to be impeached twice He now faces a trial in the Senate, which will take place after he leaves office He was accused of rousing his followers to storm the Capitol last week, leaving five dead In a sometimes stormy day of debate, some Republicans argued impeachment would further divide the nation Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi had said ""He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation"" Edited by Jessica Murphy That's all from us today. President Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. This time around, the president was charged with inciting the riot at the US Capitol last week, which left five people dead. Ten Republicans in the House of Representatives broke party ranks and voted to impeach Trump. It's a marked change from 2019's proceedings when no Republicans voted to impeach. Shortly after the vote, Trump released a video statement condemning last week's violence, but did not mention impeachment. Trump will now face trial in the Senate. This won't happen until after Democrat Joe Biden takes office next week on 20 January. Looking for more? Read more about today's vote here.

Chief Art Acevedo said the officer had been relieved of his duties and notified that he will face a disciplinary hearing. Acevedo said there was a ""high probability"" the officer will face federal charges. ""I canât tell you the anger I feel at the thought of a police officer and other police officers thinking they get to go storm the Capitol,"" he told a news conference.

""I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order in Washington DC,"" Trump says. ""We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident."" ""Like all of you I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderation."" During his remarks, Trump criticised what he described as an ""assault on free speech"". In recent days, the president's personal accounts have been removed from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. ""These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong. ""And they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another."" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has just signed the article of impeachment against President Trump. Now it's official. She's appeared with the House leaders and impeachment managers - these are the lawmakers who were tasked with presenting the case to the Senate as prosecutors. Senators will then act as jurors during the trial and ultimately decide whether or not to convict the president on the charge. The lead manager is Jamie Raskin. He's joined by Diana DeGette, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Madeleine Dean and Joe Neguse. ""Today the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Pelosi said before signing. ""That Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the country and that once again we honour that oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ""And now, I sadly and with a heart broken over what this means to our country, of a president who would incite insurrection, will sign the engrossment of the article of impeachment."" President Trump ends with a call for unity. ""All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancour and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law,"" he says. ""Today I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment, and join together as one American people,"" he says. ""God bless you, and God bless America."" The violence, Trump says, must stop. ""Whether you are on the right, or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice."" Trump refers to the additional protests planned across the US in the coming days, saying he has been briefed by authorities on potential threats. ""Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasise that there must be no violence, no law breaking, and no vandalism of any kind [sic]. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement."" In a sombre tone addressing his ""fellow Americans"", President Trump says he ""unequivocally"" condemns the violence in America's capital yesterday. ""No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,"" he said. ""If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it."" It is Trump's strongest statement to date after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol building. Five people died as a result. In a video message posted to the White House's Twitter account, Donald Trump has just condemned the violence in the Capitol last week, saying ""violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement"". He did not make any reference to impeachment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump has just become the first sitting president to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. Arecent CBS poll,externalshowed a small majority of Americans favoured impeaching Trump. We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in as well. Here's what they said: Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. If not for him continually fighting the election results and claiming the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Unfortunately it was completely predictable. Melissa Dangaran, 51, from Minnesota Unprecedented. He should not have been impeached at all. There is no justification, no legal basis, no constitutional basis for it. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm concerned about the double standard and I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. Why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? Belinda Noah, 45, from Florida It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condone white supremacy and other threats. It's deeply saddening to me. Williams Morales, 19, from Georgia I was in DC at the rally - not near the Capitol - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. It's just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, from New York Republican pollster Frank Luntz says the most ""amazing statistic"" to him is the fact that half of Trump's voters want him to keep fighting over election 2020. ""They want him to continue to fight right up to the inauguration,"" he told the BBC. He says this passion, even in the face of evidence, explains what happened during the riot last week. Luntz also warns that ""there's a danger that the Republican party actually splits in half"" post-Trump - and as things stands, at the moment, ""there are more people who'd go with Trump"". ""The level of passion among Trump voters has not dissipated,"" he notes. ""They are as loud and as passionate and I believe a whole lot of them are coming to Washington next week for the inauguration and they're not coming to cheer on Joe Biden."" Watch the full clip below. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: 'Three quarters of Trump voters believe he won' As reactions pour in from across the US, here's a look at what some of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have to say.

Trump has made history with his second impeachment. Here's how the moment is being covered, worldwide. Donald Trump is expected to speak tonight, likely sometime in the next 45 minutes. The White House is reportedly still working out where to post the video message, which will come on the heels of his second impeachment. The president's personal accounts have been barred from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook following last week's riots. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives When he was first impeached in 2019, President Donald Trump became part of a small group of rebuked US leaders. After today, President Trump is the first president to be impeached twice. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached by the House of Representatives - Andrew Johnson, back in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Another - Richard Nixon - stepped down and resigned. But to date, no president has ever been removed from the White House by Congress. So what happened to their popularity and the fortunes of their party?Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Exactly one week after security forces with guns drawn defended the House of Representatives against an angry mob, legislators gathered in the same chamber to impeach the president that mob supported. It marked the first time in the 231-year history of the United States that a president has been impeached twice in his term. For a president who likes to boast about the historic successes of his presidency, it is an ignominious ending to his time in office. The single article of impeachment accuses the president of inciting the riot that broke out at the US Capitol after he spoke to a crowd of thousands at a pro-Trump rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. It will now be forwarded to the US Senate, where the 100-member body will once again sit as a jury presided over by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. The outcome of that trial, which will not begin until after Joe Biden's inauguration, is very much in doubt. At this point, however, the political implications for the House's action can begin to be assessed. As it happened: Trump impeachment Just over a year ago, the House of Representatives impeached Trump the first time without a single Republican vote. This time around, 10 members of his own party broke ranks to support the resolution - and more condemned his words and actions on the day of the capitol riot. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, was the most notable defection. ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she wrote in a statement that was frequently quoted by Democrats during the impeachment debate. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? Already there is word that some Republicans in the Senate are open to voting to convict the president of the charges. The New York Times reported on Tuesday night that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was ""pleased"" that Trump was on the verge of being impeached and hoped that the process would allow the party to make a clean break with a president. He has since said he will reserve judgement until the trial is concluded - but such reports from the senator's usually tight-lipped office do not materialise out of thin air. Battle lines within the party, even tentative ones, are being drawn. This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? The split in the House on Wednesday sets up a choice for Republicans in the days ahead. On one hand is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique brand of heat and rhetoric. In the hours after last week's riot, Democrats grappled with how best to respond to - and punish - the president for instigating an attack that, in their view, not only threatened US democracy but also put their lives at risk. In the end, they decided making Trump a twice-impeached president, despite coming in the final week of his presidency, was their most effective move. Democrats on Wednesday were not just impeaching Donald J Trump, however. They were indicting Trumpism as a whole. The impeachment article specifically referenced the months that Trump spent attacking and undermining November's general election. And during debate in the House of Representatives, they attacked Trump's behaviour over the course of his presidency and went after Republicans in Congress who echoed the president's rhetoric. 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol There may be Republicans who want to move on from Trump and Trumpism, but it's clear at least some Democrats in Congress will try to tie the president - and last week's riot - around the neck of the entire Republican Party. Imagine, for a moment, an alternate course of history over the past few months. Donald Trump, instead of vociferously challenging his election defeat, quietly conceded in November. The Republicans would probably have won at least one of the run-off elections in Georgia and would still control the Senate. Trump, instead of facing a very real threat from Republicans eager to bury him, would be a kingmaker for the party. Another presidential run in 2024 would be a very real possibility. Instead, Trump is on the ropes. He's been silenced from social media, including his beloved Twitter account. Even if he is not prohibited from running for office by a Senate conviction, his power and influence within the Republican Party has been dented. What happens to impeached presidents? Public opinion polling, as well as his vocal defenders in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, suggest the president still has a significant well of support within his party. But the past weeks will embolden his adversaries, who sense an opportunity to deliver a lasting knockout to the president while he's down. This video can not be played Republican pollster: 'Three quarters of Trump voters still believe he won' He's at greater risk now than ever before. For five years, Trump has been proving critics and prognosticators who penned his political epitaph wrong. He's survived scandals and controversies that would take down most other politicians. This time, at long last, could be different. Upon taking the oath of office, President-elect Biden will have to contend with a pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 4,000 Americans a day and an economy that is once again worsening. Now he'll have to do so while a Senate grapples with the impeachment trial of his predecessor. Republicans warned on Wednesday that impeachment would further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal. It would, they say, make Biden's promise to unify the nation all the harder. That may end up being the case, although Democrats have been quick to counter that talk of healing rings hollow after Republicans waged a lengthy campaign to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's election. The impeachment trial, however, presents some very real practical challenges for Biden in the early days of his presidency. A Senate preoccupied with the process of passing judgement on Trump is one that will be unable to focus on enacting Biden's ambitious first-100-day agenda. It is also one that may not be able to quickly confirm Biden's administration appointees, limiting his ability to successfully manage the sprawling apparatus of the federal government. Biden has asked whether the Senate could conduct a part-time trial of Trump, working on confirmations and legislation when it is not sitting as a jury for the ex-president. A guide to the inauguration on 20 January There's no guarantees that Republicans or the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian will go along with that plan, however. The first 100 days are a pivotal time for any new president - a moment when his or her political influence is at its highest. At least some of Biden's power will be drained away by this particular fight. Did Trump's words incite the riot? A day that shook America.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over last week's deadly storming of Congress. The House of Representatives accused Mr Trump of encouraging violence with his false claims of election fraud. He now faces trial in the upper chamber, the Senate, but not before he leaves office next Wednesday. Senators can vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. In a video released after the vote,externalin the House on Wednesday, Mr Trump called on his followers to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment. ""Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence,"" he said, striking a sombre and conciliatory tone. 'Symbolic but necessaryâ: US voters react What happens to impeached presidents? Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots The FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president. This video can not be played Trump: 'Violence and vandalism have no place in our country' Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. He urged them to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard, but also to ""fight like hell"" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen. Following Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter. The building was placed on lockdown and five people died in the melee. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted"". It says he then repeated these claims and ""wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol"", leading to the violence and loss of life. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government."" Last week, 139 Republicans voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump was charged with inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?The House of Representatives has impeached him, moving the case to the Senate for a trial. But a trial will not be carried out before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January So what does it mean?A trial can happen after his term ends, and senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again For two hours on Wednesday, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote in the same chamber where they hid under chairs and donned gas masks as rioters tried to force their way inside last week. National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. Ten of Mr Trump's Republican party joined Democrats to impeach him by 232-197. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on the House floor: ""The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."" Democratic congressman Julian Castro called Mr Trump ""the most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office"". This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? Most Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity. ""Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. ""That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters."" Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, accused Democrats of recklessly dividing the country to pursue a political vendetta. ""This is about getting the president of the United States. It's always been about getting the president, no matter what. It's an obsession."" Among members of the president's party who voted to impeach him was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney. The Wyoming representative, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said of the riot that ""there has never been a greater betrayal by a president"". Donald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice. A year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration. Impeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead. The party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot Read more from Anthony The impeachment article will head to the Senate, which will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority is needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. If Mr Trump is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers could hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024. But the trial will not come during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: ""Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week."" He said it would best serve the interests of the nation if Congress focused on a safe and orderly transition of power for the incoming Biden administration. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell also said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote. Mindful that his first days in office could become mired in the impeachment drama, Mr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the ""other urgent business of this nation"", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme. However, a Republican congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced she would file articles of impeachment against Mr Biden, accusing him of abuse of power, the day after his inauguration. No US president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings in Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. So was Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used Early in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated. But research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. Most infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. Across the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. More sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols. In their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. But they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. The letter states: ""It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission"". Barry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. He is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. A signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it. ""There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place."" He believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients. Surgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about Â£5.00. Dr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid, He points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. ""We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us."" A few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance. It's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. One consultant, who did not want to be named, said: ""When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act."" RCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. ""While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases."" Public Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline. ""UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data. ""Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.""

"A provisional 270 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been secured by the African Union (AU) for distribution across the continent. All of the doses will be used this year, promises current AU head South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. This is on top of 600 million doses already promised but is still not enough to vaccinate the whole region. There are fears that poorer countries globally will wait far longer than richer nations to be inoculated. Although infection numbers and death rates are comparatively lower across most of Africa, cases are spiking again in some areas. Anew variant of Covid-19 in South Africais causing particular alarm and makes up most of the new cases. ""As a result of our own efforts we have so far secured a commitment of a provisional amount of 270 million vaccines from three major suppliers: Pfizer, AstraZeneca (through Serum Institute of India) and Johnson & Johnson,"" President Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. At least 50 million of the doses will be available ""for the crucial period of April to June 2021,"" he said. Will any countries get left out in vaccine race? Live tracker: Covid in Africa The places worried they won't get vaccines In addition, the region is expecting around 600 million doses from the global Covax effort which aims to provide vaccines to lower-income countries. But officials are still waiting for details and are now ""happy we have alternative solutions,"" Nicaise Ndembi, senior science adviser for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Preventiontold the AP news agency,external. This video can not be played Covid vaccines in Africa: What you need to know Mr Ramaphosa said officials are worried that the doses from the Covax effort released in the first half of 2021 will only be enough to inoculate health care workers. With a population of 1.3 billion people and each person requiring two vaccine jabs, Africa would need around 2.6 billion doses to eventually vaccinate everyone. ""These endeavours aim to supplement the Covax efforts, and to ensure that as many dosages of vaccine as possible become available throughout Africa as soon as possible,"" he explained. Africa has recorded more than three million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 75,000 deaths. By contrast, the US has reported close to 23 million infections and more than 383,000 fatalities. There has been a global rush to buy vaccines, with richer countries accused of buying up most of the supply. As many had feared, Africa appears to be at the back of the queue to get Covid-19 vaccines. The announcement of 270 million doses by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - who is also the current chair of the African Union - is good news. This is in addition to those secured by the Covax facility, which is led by the World Health Organisation and the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. The facility has secured 600 million doses - enough to vaccinate only a fifth of the continent. But it may be a while before any of them get to the continent. The announcements are agreements to supply vaccines. There is still the actual procurement process that needs to happen. Negotiations are ongoing. Wealthier nations had a head start. They already acquired the bulk of the early doses being produced through advance purchase deals with manufacturers. The race is on to meet that demand. Africa, on the other hand, still faces funding deficits. There are questions also about the continent's readiness to receive the vaccines. Ultra-cold refrigeration is needed for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Countries are working on building their cold chains. But even this is marred by a shortage of funds. So, the continent can only wait. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?
