"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"BBC journalists Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel have announced they are leaving the corporation to launch a new podcast and host a radio show together on LBC. Newsnight's Maitlis and outgoing North America editor Sopel have signed a deal with LBC's parent company Global. Details haven't been revealed but Maitlis called it a ""major new podcast"" and Sopel said ""opportunities like this just don't come along very often"". They follow Andrew Marr, who moved from the BBC to Global at the end of 2021. Sopel and Maitlis worked together as co-hosts of the BBC's Americast podcast, which launched in 2020. Maitlis also made headlines and won awards for her 2019 interview with Prince Andrew. On Twitter,external, she described the new daily podcast as an ""amazing opportunity"", adding that she and Sopel ""are so thrilled Global is giving us this opportunity to be big and ambitious with this project"". Maitlis has also covered many live events including elections and the EU referendum She added: ""Nevertheless, it will be a wrench to leave the BBC after 20 phenomenal years. I am so grateful for the opportunities I've had there."" Sopel tweeted,external: ""Opportunities like this just don't come along very often. But am sad to leave the BBC which has been home for so long."" He described it as ""a wrench"" to be leaving the BBC after almost four decades. ""I leave with nothing but good feelings towards the Corporation, and wish all the best to my colleagues and friends there,"" he wrote. Global said full details of the pair's new podcast would be announced later this year. There's a lot to unpick in this announcement that two more of the BBC's big hitters are departing the corporation. There'll be claims that this is yet another example of the BBC's inability to hold on to its talent. Andrew Neil and Andrew Marr have already left (the latter for LBC, where he may soon be bumping into Emily and Jon in the lift). Marr said he was ""keen to get my own voice back"", away from the BBC's impartiality drive. That may be, if not a factor in the pair's decision, at least an added bonus. But while some will read the loss of these high-profile names as a sign about the BBC's stability going forward, it may say as much about the more competitive media landscape that exists, and the companies with big pockets putting tempting offers on the table. It's also a sign of the increasing importance of podcasts. That a big player like Global is making such a huge investment in the form may be the first time a commercial radio station has signalled so overtly what podcasting means to its brand. The Maitlis/Sopel pairing will also do an LBC radio show and other analysis, but the podcast is front and centre of what's been announced today. That's in large part down to the talent involved. Maitlis brings a cachet very few others offer (and what more was there to achieve at the BBC after her Prince Andrew interview?), and the combination of her and Jon Sopel on Americast has brought a hugely loyal and dedicated following. In Dino Sofos, the ""powerhouse"" as she describes him, who was head of BBC news podcasts before recently starting his production company, they have an executive producer with a brilliant track record. What the podcast will actually contain is being kept under wraps for now. Perhaps there are clues in the press release. Maitlis says it will ""build on everything we've achieved with Americast"" and Sopel calls it an ""innovative news podcast"".  My reading is that whatever they create, it's unlikely to be solely focused on America. James Rea, director of broadcasting and content at Global, said of Sopel and Maitlis: ""They are both brilliant journalists and presenters and I know we're going to build something hugely exciting together."" Jonathan Munro, interim director of BBC News, thanked the pair for their work at the corporation. He said in a statement: ""We'd like to thank both Emily and Jon for their many years of sterling service to the BBC and wish them the very best in their new endeavours at Global."" Sopel has been a familiar face outside the White House in recent years In June last year,Maitlis was reprimandedfor breaching the BBC's impartiality rules by retweeting a ""clearly controversial"" post by Piers Morgan about the government's response to the pandemic. That came afterthe BBC ruledthat a monologue by Maitlis on Newsnight about the row over former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings' trip to County Durham had breached impartiality guidelines. Sopel started his career at the BBC in 1983 and went on to become chief political correspondent for BBC News before spending four years as the broadcaster's Paris correspondent. His reporting has taken him across the globe, covering stories such as the Israel-Lebanon war and the 2004 tsunami from Sri Lanka before he later became North America editor. He hada famous exchange with President Trumpat a 2017 press conference, and found himself in the spotlight again in 2018 followinga controversial off-air conversationwith Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys about the BBC and equal pay. He stood down as North America editor at the end of 2021. Maitlis joined the BBC in 2001 and went on to present the news bulletins on BBC One as well as presenting the news channel, then known as BBC News 24. She also presented BBC Breakfast before joining Newsnight and has also fronted many live BBC News specials including election nights and the EU referendum.

"Russian armoured vehicles in the Rostov region of Russia, near Ukraine's border Germany has put a stop to a key Russian gas pipeline following Vladimir Putin's orders to send troops into Ukraine. On Monday the Russian president recognised two breakaway Ukrainian regions as independent states and ordered Russian troops to deploy to both. Western nations largely see the action as a pretext for a wider invasion. In response, Germany halted approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and other Western nations issued sanctions. Sanctions can take various forms - the term can refer to many actions used by one country to harm another, usually to deter aggressive actions or breaches of international law. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been supported by Germanydespite opposition from countries such as the US, UK, Poland and Ukraine. It cost â¬10bn (Â£8.4bn), with the funding split between Russian and Western energy companies. But following Mr Putin's order to send troops to the rebel-held Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, Germany announced it was suspending the process of giving the pipeline between it and Russia an operating licence - effectively stopping the project until further notice.

""Additional measures"" are also, we're told, ready to go if needed. But the tougher the measures get, the harder they could become to agree. It is among a number of measures taken by Western powers following Mr Putin's announcement.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Russian actions in Ukraine are a ârenewed invasion of that countryâ The UK has announced a series of sanctions against Russia after it ordered troops into two rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine. Five banks have had their assets frozen, along with three Russian billionaires - who will also be hit with UK travel bans. Boris Johnson said Russia's actions amounted to a ""renewed invasion"" and the sanctions were a ""first barrage"". He stressed these could be extended - but faced calls for tougher action now. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on Monday, after recognising them as independent. President Putin said the troops would be ""peacekeeping"" in the breakaway regions - a claim dismissed by the US as ""nonsense"". How much Russian money is there in the UK? What sanctions could be imposed on Russia? The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis Mr Johnson announced the sanctions against Russian individuals and banks in a statement to MPs, after an emergency meeting early on Tuesday. The effort comes as part of a co-ordinated Western response to the crisis, which has also seen the EU and US impose sanctions of their own. The Foreign Office later announced the UK would also sanction Russian parliamentarians who voted to recognise the two-rebel held areas as independent last week. The sanctions will be similar to those already imposed on the three billionaires, but could take weeks to enforce as new legislation will be required. The department said that in the coming weeks British firms would also be prevented from doing business in the two breakaway areas - similar to Crimea, a region Russia illegally annexed in 2014. It added ""unprecedented"" measures targeting the Russian financial sector had been prepared if Russia went further, and threatened to stop Russia issuing sovereign debt on UK financial markets if it did not ""de-escalate"". Mr Johnson accused the Russian president of denying Ukraine's statehood, and ""establishing the pretext for a full-scale offensive"". He said Russian tanks had already been ""spotted"" in the breakaway regions, amounting to a ""renewed invasion"" of Ukraine after the 2014 crisis. This video can not be played Labour's Keir Starmer: ""Putin appears determined to plunge Ukraine into a wider war"" The EU has also announced plans to target members of the Russian parliament, as well as banks financing Russia's military. In addition, Germany has said it will freeze approval of theNord Stream 2 gas pipelineto Russia - a move welcomed by Mr Johnson. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed British sanctions, but said the UK ""must be prepared to go further"". He called for Russia to be excluded from the global Swift payment system, the banning of trading in Russian sovereign debt and action to prevent Russia ""broadcasting its propaganda around the world"", a reference to the RT news channel. Russia orders troops into eastern Ukraine Is Russia invading Ukraine? Sir Keir said he understood the government wanted to delay introducing some sanctions as a tactic to deter a Russian invasion of the rest of Ukraine, but without a ""full set of sanctions now"" President Putin would conclude that ""the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs."" Senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said there were ""serious flaws"" in the new sanctions regime, and expressed concern it would not affect ""oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey were among MPs who welcomed the sanctions announced, but also urged the prime minister to go further. At times of actual war, economic war always plays it part. Sanctions aim to put pressure on governments and nations, by limiting their flows of trade and finance. But punches were clearly pulled in the moves announced by the UK against Russia's hostile actions in Ukraine. A limited number of small banks and Putin allies will face sanctions. Some of this is by design, to allow for retaliatory escalation. But it is difficult not to detect a familiar pattern, of treading very carefully, in the face of Russian hostilities, ranging from the invasion of Georgia, to the 2006 attack on Alexander Litvinenko in the UK. Bill Browder, formerly Russia's biggest foreign investor, arch Putin-critic, and architect of the ""Magnitsky"" laws said he was disappointed, describing the sanctions announced as ""very tepid"". He said the UK had the power to sanction 50 oligarchs close to Putin with money in the UK. ""By not taking that decision, he's sending a message to Putin, which is that nothing bad will happen if you do this type of stuff,"" he added. Certainly, the incremental approach to applying sanctions gives these fabulously wealthy men, ample chance to reorganise their finances, retail their yachts, and minimise the impact of any further harsher moves. By far the most impactful measure today was the German announcement of a pause on the completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The Russian stock market fell, and the market gas price rose 10%. Although it doesn't affect existing supplies, it does mark what could be a change in direction from Russian gas-addicted Berlin. Mr Johnson later said he thought further sanctions were ""inevitable"" given the situation in Ukraine. He also suggested Russia should be stripped of hosting this season's Champions League Final. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she had ""serious concerns about the sporting events due to be held in Russia"" and would be discussing the subject with sport's governing bodies. Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin was told his country would ""pay the price for its actions"" after he was summoned to the Foreign Office. Billionaire Boris Rotenberg is among three men to be sanctioned by the UK Putin allyGennady Timchenkois a billionaire hockey enthusiast with wide business interests in energy, transportation and construction via his Volga investment group. The UK government has accused him of supporting a Russian policy of destabilising Ukraine through his association with Bank Rossiya, of which he is a major shareholder. Igor Rotenberg, another close associate of President Putin, is the oldest son of Arkady Rotenberg and the majority shareholder in the Gazprom Drilling company. Igor's uncle,Boris Rotenberg, has also been targeted. Mr Rotenberg is the co-owner - along with his brother Arkady - of the SGM group, the largest construction company for gas pipelines and electrical power supply lines in Russia. The UK's sanctions notice says he is ""benefiting from or supporting"" the Russian state in his role in a key strategic sector. Rossiyais a privately-owned bank, which also has stakes in a television company. TheBlack Sea Bankis a Crimean bank and was created in 2014 after Russia annexed the region. TheGeneral Bankis a financial institution which also operates in Crimea. Promsvyazbankis a Russian state-owned bank, which the UK government says provides funding to Russia's military. The BBC's Business correspondent Theo Leggett says the UK was not targeting the biggest banks but banks known to be used by President Putin's inner circle. Are you in Ukraine?

"Screaming Trees frontman and former Queens of the Stone Age member Mark Lanegan has died at the age of 57. Known for his deep, melancholy vocals, the American singer-songwriter died at his home in Killarney, Ireland, a statement on hisTwitter account,externalsaid. During his career he collaborated with musicians including Kurt Cobain, PJ Harvey, Isobel Campbell and Moby. Last year, he was in hospital for months after contracting Covid, and was put into a medically-induced coma. No cause of death has been given. A statement said: ""Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland. ""A beloved singer, songwriter, author, and musician he was 57 and is survived by his wife Shelley [Brien]."" Born in Washington state in 1964, Lanegan joined Screaming Trees in the 1980s and went on to produce eight studio albums until the group's split in 2000. The band pioneered a sound that combined 1960s garage rock with 1970s punk - which later became known as grunge. Although they never achieved the mainstream success of contemporaries like Soundgarden and Nirvana, they scored hits in the US with Nearly Lost You in 1992 and All I Know in 1996.

Lanegan had a parallel solo career, and his debut album, The Winding Sheet, included appearances from Cobain and Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic. After the Screaming Trees went on hiatus in 1996, he joined the ever-changing line-up of Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age. He first appeared on the rock band's Rated R album in 2000, lending his voice and songwriting talent to several songs, and also performed on their breakout album Songs for the Deaf - earning a Grammy nomination for both. He later formed The Gutter Twins with Afghan Whigs vocalist Greg Dulli; and recorded three collaborative albums with Scottish singer-songwriter Isobel Campbell - the first of which, Ballad of the Broken Seas, was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize.

"Boots will begin selling Covid rapid tests in store next month Pharmacy Boots will begin selling single Covid tests for Â£5.99 from Wednesday, despite free kits being available via the NHS until 1 April. Customers can purchase a pack of four lateral flow tests online for Â£17, or one test for Â£5.99, including delivery. Next month people can buy them in-store for Â£12 for a pack of five. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a ""Living with Covid"" plan, which will end free testing and scrap self-isolation rules and payments. Asif Aziz, director of healthcare services at Boots UK, said: ""We are pleased to be expanding our Covid-19 testing services even further, with affordable lateral flow testing options for those who still want peace of mind from asymptomatic testing after 1 April."" The company said the earlier launch date was to prepare both supply chains and customers ahead of the end of free testing. However, there was mixed reaction to the announcement on social media, with one Twitter user pointing out the increased costs to households to act responsibly when one member catches the virus. Some countries have placed a price cap on Covid tests, such as Spain which has a Â£2.45 maximum price cap. In France the maximum price pharmacies can charge has fallen to â¬6 (Â£5) but the cap is due to be cut further. When France temporarily allowed kits to be sold at supermarkets until 15 February they were available for as little as â¬1.25 Another user, Carly Nicholls, asked about the implications for Boots staff potentially being exposed to more Covid-positive people. ""How do Boots staff feel about being point of contact for so many people, if sold in-store? Some of those testing will be suspected Covid infections."" Free rapid tests will no longer be an option for many in England Dan Shears, national health and safety director at the GMB union, described the move as ""rampant profiteering"" and said the cost would be a big sacrifice for the lowest-paid workers. ""The government should provide tests for free - they are a clear public health benefit that far outweighs cost. But if we have to pay, test provision should be subsidised to make tests affordable. ""The reality is that those who are most at risk are least able to afford testing, meaning it will not happen and low-paid workers - many of whom are key workers - will continue to take the brunt of Covid."" Business groups also warned on Monday that the government must not put the cost and responsibility of testing on employers. ""Access to free testing is key to managing workplace sickness and maintaining consumer confidence,"" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director, Claire Walker, said. ""If the government is to remove this, companies must still be able to access tests on a cost-effective basis,"" she added. People in England can now only order one pack of rapid tests every 72 hours, instead of every day previously, as the government winds down the service ahead of April.

"Nicola Sturgeon says that Scotland's Covid passport scheme will end on 28 February with the legal requirement to wear face masks being lifted on 21 March Although vaccines, treatments and public behaviour have got the country to the place it is now, the first minister says it is important to remain vigilant and prepared Ms Sturgeon's address comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces that all legal restrictions would end in England later this week Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomes the first minister's statement, saying it was his party who had previously mapped a plan out of Covid restrictions Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says she is unclear what the government's approach is to testing and urges Ms Sturgeon to explain The FM says she needs clarity from the UK government on whether additional resources will be made available to pay for a ""robust testing system"" The number of new positive cases in Scotland stands at 6,427; 1,060 people are in hospital with confirmed Covid 19 and 12 of those are recent patients to ICU BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon confirms lifting dates for Covid rules Here's a reminder of the key points from the Scottish goverment's Covid strategic framework:  Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Virologist Dr Chris Smith tells Drivetime many of the regulations that have been in place addressed last year's concerns.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set
out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

The company said the earlier launch date was to prepare both supply chains and customers ahead of the end of free testing. However, there was mixed reaction to the announcement on social media, with one Twitter user pointing out the increased costs to households to act responsibly when one member catches the virus. Some countries have placed a price cap on Covid tests, such as Spain which has a Â£2.45 maximum price cap. In France the maximum price pharmacies can charge has fallen to â¬6 (Â£5) but the cap is due to be cut further. When France temporarily allowed kits to be sold at supermarkets until 15 February they were available for as little as â¬1.25 Another user, Carly Nicholls, asked about the implications for Boots staff potentially being exposed to more Covid-positive people. ""How do Boots staff feel about being point of contact for so many people, if sold in-store? Some of those testing will be suspected Covid infections."" Free rapid tests will no longer be an option for many in England Dan Shears, national health and safety director at the GMB union, described the move as ""rampant profiteering"" and said the cost would be a big sacrifice for the lowest-paid workers. ""The government should provide tests for free - they are a clear public health benefit that far outweighs cost. But if we have to pay, test provision should be subsidised to make tests affordable. ""The reality is that those who are most at risk are least able to afford testing, meaning it will not happen and low-paid workers - many of whom are key workers - will continue to take the brunt of Covid."" Business groups also warned on Monday that the government must not put the cost and responsibility of testing on employers. ""Access to free testing is key to managing workplace sickness and maintaining consumer confidence,"" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director, Claire Walker, said. ""If the government is to remove this, companies must still be able to access tests on a cost-effective basis,"" she added. People in England can now only order one pack of rapid tests every 72 hours, instead of every day previously, as the government winds down the service ahead of April.

"Health Minister Robin Swann has said he will not be ""rushed"" into taking decisions on rules around the use of free mass testing in Northern Ireland. The government in England plans tobring it to an end from 1 April. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should be following Number 10's lead, but Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP have urged caution. In a tweet, Mr Swann said he would not base his decisions on ""timetables elsewhere"". ""I have asked officials to draw up policy options based on an appropriate, proportionate approach to testing in NI. In the meantime, there will be no changes to the current approach,"" he said.

Mr Swann added that testing ""will continue to have a role, especially in protecting the most vulnerable"", and that further discussions on funding would be required with London and his Stormont ministerial colleagues. Speaking at Stormont on Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted free testing to continue but it would come at a cost. ""We have to make a decision do we try and provide our own supply and the cost of that, in a situation where we can't take budgetary decisions, where departments only have the baseline they have to spend into the new financial year because of the absence of the executive. ""That makes it infinitely more difficult."" Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it would wrong for Northern Ireland to bring an end to free testing. Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was important that people are supported financially to test and self-isolate if required. However DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should follow England's move. He described the recent strains of the virus as being similar to the impact of the common flu and that Northern Ireland should change test and trace procedures. ""We don't do that kind of extensive test and trace for common flu, we don't ask people to self-isolate immediately, we don't ask businesses to be disrupted as a result of that. ""We ask people to engage in common sense. ""Test and trace was introduced at a time when we didn't have all of the means to combat Covid that we do today."" Ms Mallon said testing was ""an important means of controlling transmission"". The UK Treasury would save billions of pounds by scrapping or reducing the number of free tests ""Now to be saying, particularly to low income families, that they will have to pay for that is deeply, deeply concerning,"" said the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) minister. The justice minister said whether it is Covid-19 or other conditions, people should ""not be going into the workplace ill and passing it on to colleagues who may be vulnerable or have vulnerable members of families"". ""But for people to make that choice, they have to be able to test, they have to know they're unwell and have financial support to let them self-isolate,"" said Mrs Long.

No change to Covid test and trace rules in NI Johnson: Do not throw Covid caution to the wind From Thursday,people with a positive Covid-19 test in England no longer legally need to self-isolate and routine tracing will end. Remaining Covid restrictions are also being lifted in England, and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. Dr David Farren, from the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said free testing should remain and the government's decision could ""come back to bite us"". ""Testing people and isolating them is the way you stop the bug from jumping from one person to another and effectively the prime minister has removed two very important protections in England with that move,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday. The infection control doctor said there could be ""further spread"" because people may not be able to afford tests or take time away from work. This risked creating a ""two-tier"" health system, he added, ""the like of which we haven't seen within our NHS"". Dr David Farren said it was wrong to ask people to pay for Covid-19 tests Patricia McKeown, from the trade union Unison, said the pandemic had highlighted the importance of sick pay. But Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said there was a need to ""learn to live with"" coronavirus and ending testing ""is a choice about how we spend taxpayers' money"". Meanwhile, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, Patricia Donnelly, said mass vaccine centres will not be needed for the next roll-out of the Covid jab. Over the course of the pandemic, mass vaccination centres were set up across Northern Ireland to administer Covid-19 vaccines on larger scales at locations including the SSE Arena and the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast. Ms Donnelly also said health officials in Northern Ireland expect the roll-out to be extended to over-50s in autumn and ""are planning for it"". She said it had been expected there would be an annual vaccination programme, similar to how the flu vaccine is rolled out. Additional vaccines being made available for those aged 75 and over in 2022 could be facilitated by GPs, community pharmacies and health trusts, she said. This video can not be played Patricia Donnelly said additional jabs could be facilitated by GPs, community pharmacies and health trusts. About 155,000 people will be eligible for the booster jab, with the roll-out expected to begin in April. There must be a gap of at least six months since a previous dose. Those eligible for the booster vaccine are: adults aged 75 and over older adults in care homes people aged 12 and over with a weak immune system On Monday, Stormont ministers held talks with the UK government about future funding to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. At the weekend, ministers from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales wrote a joint letter to Michael Gove expressing fears that funding for testing was about to be cut.

"Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night Northern Ireland's health service is ""incredibly fragile"" and seeing ""very sick patients"", the Northern Trust's chief executive has said. It comes after a potential major incident was declared at Antrim Area Hospital. The incident has been stood down, but it is rare and one step from a major incident. A major incident means there are too many patients for staff to deal with safely. The decision was made on Tuesday at 14:00 GMT, and lasted several hours. At one point, 62 patients, mostly frail and elderly, were waiting to be admitted - the highest number ever recorded at the hospital. That number came down to fewer than 50 as of 17:00 GMT, according to Northern Trust chief executive Jennifer Welsh. She said the pressure being felt goes beyond one region. The South Eastern Trust and the Western Trust have both made staff appeals on social media for the Ulster Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital, with the South Eastern Trust reporting ""extreme pressures"".

Despite the Antrim Area Hospital incident being stood down, the Northern Trust said it was ""not out of the woods yet"". Declaring a major incident is very rare, and it's something that no health trust wants to do. But the fact that we had a consultant putting their arms up and saying ""we cannot cope beyond this point"" is really significant. It's an attempt by staff to keep the service running as safely as possible. There was a partial diversion of ambulances away from the hospital, but I was told the hospital could not instruct a full one because other hospitals are also under extreme pressure. It's almost like rallying the troops - when they put out a message like this, it really does bring all the health trusts round to work as a region, to work almost as one hospital. It's also a way of saying to the public, only come to us if it is an emergency. At 16:30 GMT on Monday, there were 281 patients waiting to be admitted to emergency departments across Northern Ireland, according to Ms Welsh. She said Covid had played a ""significant role"" in the decision to call a potential major incident at Antrim Area Hospital, but also that it was partly due to the hospital not having enough beds. Almost a third of patients there are Covid positive. Jennifer Welsh says the Antrim Area Hospital has a ""well-recognised"" bed shortage But, even if all the patients currently at the hospital were discharged, they would still be short of beds, she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""It is well recognised that we really do not have the beds for the population we serve,"" she said. ""We have about 28% of the population of Northern Ireland but we've only got about 12% of the bed stock in this area, so we have a very high demand and we really don't have enough beds."" She said Tuesday's decision ""was not taken lightly"" but would allow the hospital to get more help. Ms Welsh said this pressure across emergency departments means that ""the ability to help each other out is not there in the way it would have been in the past"".

"Gary Brooker, the frontman of 1960s rock band Procol Harum, has died at the age of 76, his record label has confirmed. The London-born singer led the band throughout their 55-year history, co-writing and singing their most famous song, 1967's A Whiter Shade of Pale. He was appointed an OBE in 2003, and A Whiter Shade of Pale was honoured by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Brooker died at his home from cancer on Saturday,the band said in a statement,external. ""He lit up any room he entered, and his kindness to a multilingual family of fans was legendary,"" they wrote in tribute. ""He was notable for his individuality, integrity, and occasionally stubborn eccentricity. His mordant wit, and appetite for the ridiculous, made him a priceless raconteur."" Brooker also toured with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr, and played with Sir Paul McCartney, Bill Wyman, George Harrison, the Alan Parsons Project and many others. In 1996, he appeared alongside Madonna in Alan Parker's film adaptation of Evita, playing Argentine foreign minister Juan Atilio Bramuglia. Born in Hackney, east London, Brooker was just 14 when he formed his first band, The Paramounts, at school. After achieving success at local youth groups, they signed to EMI Records and scored a minor hit with their debut single, Poison Ivy, in January 1964. The band received a major endorsement from the Rolling Stones, who gave them guest billing on several memorable shows in the early 1960s - but none of their subsequent singles troubled the charts and they eventually split up. Brooker went on to form Procol Harum in 1966, and released their best-known song the following year. One of the anthems of the summer of love, A Whiter Shade of Pale was an unusual song - from its surreal lyrics (""We tripped the light fandango"") to the haunting organ line, and the melancholy arrangement, loosely based on Bach's Air on the G String.

Nonetheless, it became one of the most commercially-successful singles of all time, selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. At the first ever Brit Awards in 1977, it was named the joint winner (alongside Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody) of the ""best British pop single 1952-1977"". In 2009, it was named the most-played song of the last 75 years by UK radio stations. ""From the moment that we made it we knew it was special,""Brooker said in 2017,external. ""Whenever I played it to anyone, it was just me sitting at the piano, and every person thought that it sounded like a hit. So we honestly believed that it was going to be a hit even before we had recorded it. ""Once we had recorded it and had captured that very characteristic sound, a rather haunting sound, we really did think that it was a good one."" The band promoted the record by touring with Jimi Hendrix, and followed it up with a top 10 single, Homburg. However, the band ""never sought to replicate"" the sound of those early records, ""preferring to forge a restlessly progressive path"", they said in the statement announcing Brooker's death. Their third album, 1969's A Salty Dog, is regarded as their masterpiece, ushering in an era of lush, orchestrated progressive rock. Fans included film director Martin Scorsese, who wrote about their ""magisterial melodies and teasing, enigmatic lyrics you could invest with your own fantasies"" in the foreword to Henry Scott-Irvine's 2012 book about the band. But the group split in 1977 after a series of line-up changes. Brooker launched a solo career and toured with Eric Clapton's live band in the 1980s, but reformed Procol Harum for a new album, The Prodigal Stranger, in 1991. He also fought a lengthy legal battle with former bandmate Matthew Fisher, who claimed to have written the organ riff on A Whiter Shade of Pale. The case eventually went to the House of Lords, which ruled thatFisher was entitled to a share of royalties,externalfrom the song. The band went through several line-up changes, but Brooker (third from right) was a constant presence Meanwhile, the modern line-up of Procol Harum continued to record and tour until the Covid pandemic put their plans on hold. They played their final gig with Brooker in Switzerland in 2019, and used the time away from touring to record a three-track EP, Missing Persons (Alive Forever), which was released in May 2021. ""Gary's voice and piano were the single defining constant of Procol's 50-year international concert career,"" the band said on Tuesday. ""Without any stage antics or other gimmicks he was invariably the most watchable musician in the show. ""But for all his other interests and skills - prize-winning angler, pub-owner, lyricist, painter, inventor - he was above all a devoted and loyal husband to Franky, whom he met in 1965 and married in 1968.

"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin announces that Russia will recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into two rebel-held regions in eastern Ukraine, after recognising them as independent states. Russia said the troops have not yet been deployed but will be ""peacekeeping"" in the regions, which it has backed since 2014. The US said calling them peacekeepers was ""nonsense"", and accused Russia of creating a pretext for war. Several countries have announced sanctions in response. Ukraine's president said his country was ""not afraid of anything or anyone"". In a late-night televised address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for ""clear and effective actions of support"" from Ukraine's international allies. ""It is very important to see now who our real friend and partner is, and who will continue to scare the Russian Federation with words only,"" he added. Fears over an invasion have been rising in recent months, as Russia has massed some 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders, according to US estimates. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield dismissed Russia's claims that troops would be taking on a ""peacekeeping"" role, saying: ""We know what they really are."" Recognising Luhansk and Donetsk as independent was part of Russia's bid to create a reason to invade Ukraine, she said. EXPLAINER:What does Putin want? ON THE GROUND:War, sickness and love in rebel-held Ukraine LIVE:Latest updates on Ukraine Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine for the past eight years. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. In recent years,Russian passports have been given out to large numbers of peoplein Donetsk and Luhansk. The rebel-held areas have been evacuating women, children and the elderly to Russia since late last week. In an hour-long address on Monday, Mr Putin said Ukraine was an integral part of his country's history, and described eastern Ukraine as ""ancient Russian lands"". Russia's UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya argued for the need to defend the rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region from what he called Ukrainian aggression. ""Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,"" he said. But Mr Zelensky said Moscow's recognition of the rebel-held regions represented a threat to the security of Ukraine and other European nations. ""If we have a full-scale escalation... our neighbours would be put at risk,"" he said. Western powers have rallied behind Ukraine, promising tough sanctions against Russia if it invades - though it is not yet clear how effective this move could be. The US swiftly condemned Mr Putin's move, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order that prohibits new investment, trade and financing by Americans in the breakaway regions. The White House said the measures were separate to wider Western sanctions which are ready to go ""should Russia further invade Ukraine"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia had violated Ukrainian sovereignty and ""completely torn up"" international law. He said Mr Putin appeared ""bent on a full-scale invasion"",and promised a ""barrage of sanctions"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was halting the process of certifying the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline because of Russia's actions.The gas pipeline between Russia and Germanywas completed last September but is not yet operating. Running under the Baltic Sea, it would double Moscow's gas exports to Germany and circumvent Ukraine, which relies on existing pipelines for income. The European Union pledged to ""react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine"". Both Mr Scholz and France's President Emmanuel Macron spoke with the Russian leader ahead of his announcement. This speech was Putin the angry, impatient and directly threatening. It felt like Russia's president was getting 20-odd years of hurt off his chest and hitting back. ""You didn't want us to be friends,"" was how he put it to the West, ""but you didn't have to make an enemy of us."" There was a lot we've heard before, repackaged for this moment when he knows he has maximum attention. He's clearly ceding no ground on his key security demands: Nato expansion must be rolled back, and Ukrainian membership is a red line. He complained that Russia's concerns had been ignored as irrelevant for years and accused the West of trying to ""contain"" Russia as a resurgent global force. Mr Putin's focus on Ukraine felt obsessive, like a man who thinks about little else. At times it sounded like a bid to run for president there, it was so detailed. And, of course, there was his re-writing of Ukrainian history, to claim it has never really been a state. In today's context, that had deeply ominous overtones. READ MORE:Putin's angry speech rewriting Ukraine's history A Ukrainian serviceman at a position on the front line near the village of Travneve in Donetsk region Groundwork for the controversial decision was laid earlier on Monday, when Mr Putin convened Russia's security council to discuss recognising the self-declared republics as independent. Mr Putin's top officials were called to a podium to deliver their views, each speaking in favour of the move. Monday's televised meeting was not entirely smooth, however. Two officials appeared to reference a possibility to ""incorporate"" the regions into Russia. On both occasions, Mr Putin corrected them. ""We are not talking about that,"" Mr Putin said, shaking his head in response to one official's use of the phrase. ""We are talking about whether to recognise their independence or not.""

"Oil and gas prices climbed on Tuesday on fears the Ukraine-Russia crisis will disrupt supplies across the world. The price of Brent crudeoil, an international benchmark, touched a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine's east. But prices later moderated, despite Western countries responding with economic sanctions and moves to block a key Russian gas pipeline. Shares also stemmed early losses. After falling more than 1.5% in early trade on Tuesday, Wall Street turned up following remarks by US President Joe Biden outlining the US response. The Dow closed down 1.4%, however, while the wider S&P 500 slumped 1% and the Nasdaq fell 1.2%. Earlier,Japan's Nikkei 225 indexclosed 1.7% lower, and the Shanghai Composite fell nearly 1%, but share indexes in Europe and the UK ended roughly flat, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.1%. ""The West at the moment is treading fairly carefully,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at the brokers AJ Bell. Russia is the second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's top producer of natural gas. Measures forcing the country to supply less crude or natural gas would have ""substantial implications"" on oil prices and the global economy, said Sue Trinh of Manulife Investment Management. PM announces UK sanctions against Russia Russia recognises Ukraine separatist regions What sanctions could be imposed on Russia? The RAC warned the crisis would push up UK petrol prices further, after they hit a record 149.12p a litre on Sunday. ""Russia's decision to invade Ukraine is already causing oil prices to rise and will undoubtedly send fuel prices inexorably higher towards the grim milestone of Â£1.50 a litre [of unleaded petrol],"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""This spells bad news for drivers in the UK struggling to afford to put fuel in their cars."" But the steps announced by the US, UK and Europe so far fall short of what had been threatened in the event of invasion. The sanctions target financial institutions, elites and other government entities in Russia, in part aiming to restrict the Russian government's ability to raise money on Western financial markets. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also took the significant step of blocking the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany. ""If Russian goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further,"" US President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House. He also warned that defending Nato territory could come at a cost to the public in the form of higher energy prices. A Ukrainian service member in the Donetsk region Since the start of February, already-rising oil prices have jumped more than 10% amid the tensions. Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 a barrel due to a combination of the Ukraine crisis, a cold winter in the US, and a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world. ""Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it's really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps,"" she said. Russia has spent years preparing for this moment. In 2014, when Russian troops moved into Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine, it provoked a first round of international sanctions. And that taught Moscow an important lesson. Since then it's been setting up defences, moving away from relying on the dollar, and trying to sanction-proof the Russian economy. President Putin may be betting that he can withstand sanctions for longer than the West assumes. Read more Most of the oil and gas that the UK imports does not come from Russia, but it would nonetheless be affected by a rise in global prices. Average diesel prices in the UK hit 152.51p a litre on Monday, just below Sunday's record of 152.58p, the RAC said. UK wholesale gas prices have also jumped, with the UK price for April delivery up 9% and the cost for May up 10% to 191p per therm. However, that remained lower than the highs seen in December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. The economic inter-dependence between Russia and Europe is likely to limit Western actions going forward, said Shaistah Akhtar, an expert on sanctions law from the UK law firm Mishcon de Reya. But some of the restraint so far is deliberate, she added. ""They needed to allow some room to manoeuvre,"" she said. Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics said the tensions are likely to keep oil prices elevated, even if the West does not take more aggressive action. ""It is not in the economic interests of either Russia or the West to use trade in energy as a weapon against each other, but that is not to say it won't happen,"" he wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Even if the West does not implement direct sanctions on Russia's energy exports, tensions with Russia could keep oil prices higher for longer.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set
out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gary Brooker, the frontman of 1960s rock band Procol Harum, has died at the age of 76, his record label has confirmed. The London-born singer led the band throughout their 55-year history, co-writing and singing their most famous song, 1967's A Whiter Shade of Pale. He was appointed an OBE in 2003, and A Whiter Shade of Pale was honoured by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Brooker died at his home from cancer on Saturday,the band said in a statement,external. ""He lit up any room he entered, and his kindness to a multilingual family of fans was legendary,"" they wrote in tribute. ""He was notable for his individuality, integrity, and occasionally stubborn eccentricity. His mordant wit, and appetite for the ridiculous, made him a priceless raconteur."" Brooker also toured with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr, and played with Sir Paul McCartney, Bill Wyman, George Harrison, the Alan Parsons Project and many others. In 1996, he appeared alongside Madonna in Alan Parker's film adaptation of Evita, playing Argentine foreign minister Juan Atilio Bramuglia. Born in Hackney, east London, Brooker was just 14 when he formed his first band, The Paramounts, at school. After achieving success at local youth groups, they signed to EMI Records and scored a minor hit with their debut single, Poison Ivy, in January 1964. The band received a major endorsement from the Rolling Stones, who gave them guest billing on several memorable shows in the early 1960s - but none of their subsequent singles troubled the charts and they eventually split up. Brooker went on to form Procol Harum in 1966, and released their best-known song the following year. One of the anthems of the summer of love, A Whiter Shade of Pale was an unusual song - from its surreal lyrics (""We tripped the light fandango"") to the haunting organ line, and the melancholy arrangement, loosely based on Bach's Air on the G String.

Nonetheless, it became one of the most commercially-successful singles of all time, selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. At the first ever Brit Awards in 1977, it was named the joint winner (alongside Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody) of the ""best British pop single 1952-1977"". In 2009, it was named the most-played song of the last 75 years by UK radio stations. ""From the moment that we made it we knew it was special,""Brooker said in 2017,external. ""Whenever I played it to anyone, it was just me sitting at the piano, and every person thought that it sounded like a hit. So we honestly believed that it was going to be a hit even before we had recorded it. ""Once we had recorded it and had captured that very characteristic sound, a rather haunting sound, we really did think that it was a good one."" The band promoted the record by touring with Jimi Hendrix, and followed it up with a top 10 single, Homburg. However, the band ""never sought to replicate"" the sound of those early records, ""preferring to forge a restlessly progressive path"", they said in the statement announcing Brooker's death. Their third album, 1969's A Salty Dog, is regarded as their masterpiece, ushering in an era of lush, orchestrated progressive rock. Fans included film director Martin Scorsese, who wrote about their ""magisterial melodies and teasing, enigmatic lyrics you could invest with your own fantasies"" in the foreword to Henry Scott-Irvine's 2012 book about the band. But the group split in 1977 after a series of line-up changes. Brooker launched a solo career and toured with Eric Clapton's live band in the 1980s, but reformed Procol Harum for a new album, The Prodigal Stranger, in 1991. He also fought a lengthy legal battle with former bandmate Matthew Fisher, who claimed to have written the organ riff on A Whiter Shade of Pale. The case eventually went to the House of Lords, which ruled thatFisher was entitled to a share of royalties,externalfrom the song. The band went through several line-up changes, but Brooker (third from right) was a constant presence Meanwhile, the modern line-up of Procol Harum continued to record and tour until the Covid pandemic put their plans on hold. They played their final gig with Brooker in Switzerland in 2019, and used the time away from touring to record a three-track EP, Missing Persons (Alive Forever), which was released in May 2021. ""Gary's voice and piano were the single defining constant of Procol's 50-year international concert career,"" the band said on Tuesday. ""Without any stage antics or other gimmicks he was invariably the most watchable musician in the show. ""But for all his other interests and skills - prize-winning angler, pub-owner, lyricist, painter, inventor - he was above all a devoted and loyal husband to Franky, whom he met in 1965 and married in 1968.

out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dr Smith, of Cambridge University, says: ""We're in a very different place now."" He says the population is highly immune and we're heading towards summer, therefore the odds are stacked in our favour more. ""The measures of de-escalating things moving ahead are sensible.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set

Hiut Denim Co. in Cardigan, Ceredigion. said European sales were 36% down, while production fuel costs are up 30%. Pero Foods, in Betws-y-Coed, Conwy county, said its European turnover was down 86%. But a UK minister said evidence Brexit had caused trade drops was""few and far between"". Last week Minister for Brexit Opportunities Jacob Rees-Mogg said Brexit was ""already a success"" and that he would be working to ""cut through the thicket"" of red tape. Dave Hieatt said Brexit had made trading harder It's exactly 20 years since the closure of the Dewhirst jeans factory in Cardigan. Hiut Denim Co. took on local workers' expertise and skills to produce jeans once again, earning fansincluding the Duchess of Sussex. The company's co-founder Dave Hieatt said he was having to work harder because of the adverse affects of Brexit. ""It's really disappointing because business is hard anyway,"" he said.

""And so Brexit unfortunately is not helping... it's just not helping."" Hiut is run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt The UKleft the EU's trading regimeon 1 January 2021, 11 months after it left the bloc - with its trade now governed by a post-Brexit trade deal. Since then, British businesses have experienced additional paperwork and border checks when exporting products to EU countries, something Mr Hieatt said was detrimental to business. ""Europe has been very important for us but since Brexit, our sales have been 36% down. Our production in fuel costs are 30% up, so it's definitely a little bit harder,"" he said. Pero Foods director Jonathan Rees said the company had seen decline of around 86% in its turnover into Europe Pero Foods said that since 2020/2021 it had lost about Â£750,000 worth of business to customers within the EU. Jonathan Rees, director of the natural pet food manufacturer, described the attitude from Westminster as ""quite dismissive"" and said he was not convinced things would get better. ""Brexit is having an astounding effect on us as a business,"" he said. ""We've seen a decline of around 86% in our turnover into Europe. ""The Republic of Ireland was a big customer and we've lost everything that went over to Ireland."" He added: ""Paperwork and the administrative side is one thing but because we're a small business, we can't fill lorries and so we have to be a part of another load, and many of the transport companies don't allow combining loads in case there's a problem with the paperwork of one delivery that could stop the rest of the goods from crossing the border."" A recent report by the Public Accounts Committee said new arrangements for the UK-EU border had added costs to exporting businesses. According to a cross-party committee of MPs, trade had been ""suppressed"" since the UK cut formal trade ties in January 2021, due a combination of Brexit, Covid and global economic problems. These factors combined have led to a decline in Welsh meat exports. In 2021, UK beef exports were down 11% on the previous year, with lamb seeing a 20% reduction. John Richards said the extra paperwork was hitting exporters Industry Development and Relations Manager at Meat Promotion Wales, John Richards, said there was no denying the pandemic had a significant impact on the industry, but Brexit still raised serious challenges; ""The biggest challenge we've had over the last year or so is the extra paperwork that's required in order to get products to be exported,"" he said. ""And that extra paperwork requires more resource, more time, and all this costs exporters money. ""In the short term, unfortunately, there's no quick fix."" He said exporting red meat to the EU was ""vitally important"". ""We export about a third of what we produce here in Wales, and around 95% of what we export ends up going into Europe."" Wales Office Minister David TC Davies MP insisted more opportunities were now available for businesses as markets have opened for Welsh companies in places such as Asia and Australia. ""We've had a very difficult year, because of Covid and companies around the world are suffering at the moment,"" he said. ""But now, the situation is looking very good.

"OnlyFans has been accused of conspiring to blacklist the social media accounts of adult performers working for rival websites, BBC News has learned. Legal documents, previously unreported, claim OnlyFans directed an unidentified social media company to disable accounts of performers by placing their content on a terrorism database. It is alleged that OnlyFans representatives paid bribes to the firm's employees to facilitate the practice. OnlyFans says it is aware of the legal claim and it has ""no merit"". UK website OnlyFans - best known for hosting pornography - has grown hugely in recent years. It lets users share video clips and photos with subscribers in return for tips or a monthly fee. Performers often use social media accounts - including Twitter and Instagram - to promote and link to adult websites showing their explicit content. BBC News has learned that rival adult website FanCentro has begun legal action in the US against OnlyFans' owner Leonid Radvinsky and the company which receives OnlyFans' payments, Fenix Internet LLC. The claim was submitted to a US court in Florida last November, but has been unreported until now. It alleges OnlyFans directed an unidentified social media company to blacklist many competitor adult websites in 2018. FanCentro claims the social media content of adult performers promoting rival websites to OnlyFans was placed on an international database - the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). The database uses advanced technology to stop the spread of terrorist images by recording a unique digital signature for them, known as ""hashes"". The hash database is shared between all 18 members of the forum - including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. If one company hashes a video or photograph, it is flagged to other members so they can moderate similar content on their platform. According to the legal action, FanCentro believes the database was ""manipulated"", resulting in many adult performers having social posts removed and accounts disabled - despite them not containing any terrorist content. This happened most noticeably on Instagram, according to the filing. It is claimed the resulting reduced visibility of performers on social media led to a marked decline in traffic being driven to rival websites of OnlyFans. FanCentro is seeking financial damages. However, performers who only promoted their OnlyFans accounts on social media did not face this punitive content moderation - it is alleged - leading to a big growth in traffic visiting the website. The legal action also claims one or more employees of the unidentified social media company - including potentially a senior member of staff - may have been bribed to facilitate the scheme by OnlyFans representatives. OnlyFans has not yet issued a legal response but a spokesperson said the company was aware of the claims - describing them as having ""no merit"". Facebook is not named in the legal action but BBC News has learned that it has been issued with a subpoena - meaning it may be compelled to provide records. Facebook and Instagram both have the same parent company - Meta. The subpoena requests copies of any internal documents showing rival websites to OnlyFans included on lists of so-called Dangerous Individual or Organizations held by Meta and any payments received from OnlyFans representatives. Under US law, companies may be subpoenaed if they hold any relevant information to the subject matter of a claim, and not only if they have evidence which may reveal whether anyone is at fault.ââ Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email atnoel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk,external One of FanCentro's legal team - David Azar of law firm, Milberg - says the company is planning on subpoenaing other companies for evidence, including other social media firms. In a statement, Meta said: ""These allegations are without merit and we will address them in the context of the litigation as needed."" It added that it had investigated and found no evidence the shared hash database had been abused. In recent years, performers using Instagram to promote and link to their adult websites have complained that even though they have not broken the site's community guidelines - they have been served with violation notifications and had posts removed. The subsequent loss of visibility and promotion of these accounts became known as a ""shadowban"". For performers, it remains a mystery to what extent any action taken against accounts was because of specific policy or targeted moderation of their content. ""We were seeing mass deletions without any real clear reason as to what was happening or why,"" says Alana Evans, president of a group which represents performers - the Adult Performers Actors Guild. She says she has seen performers fall into severe financial difficulty with some even left homeless. In 2019, some performers met Instagram representatives after claiming their accounts had been disabled. The company acknowledged that some had been incorrectly removed but denied it had been done deliberately. ""We do not have policies that target adult performers,"" a spokesperson said at the time. One model, who we're calling Camila to protect her identity, used to have millions of followers on her Instagram account - which is verified, similar to a blue tick on Twitter. She says the removal of much of her content and eventual closure of her account had a ""devastating"" impact on her. Camila's posts regularly feature her in a bikini or underwear. Typically, she would accompany her photos with links to an adult website - an OnlyFans' rival - which hosted videos that users needed to pay to watch. In October 2018, she began receiving violation notifications for content removed by Instagram. Soon, posts started to be taken down regularly. Some of the photos removed were mundane images - including tourist snaps when she was fully clothed. ""They started to get deleted several times a day and then several posts at a time,"" she says. BBC News has learned that Camila's Instagram account status - only visible by engineering staff - was changed to ""critical"". This meant it was not promoted as prominently any more, leading to reduced visibility. ""My page was slowly dying and losing followers because posts were getting deleted. It means nobody sees me,"" she says. Camila says she continually appealed against the removal of her pictures but only received an automated response. At one point, even her ability to appeal to Instagram was removed, she says. Her account was later closed completely. Camila says she used to earn at least $50,000 (Â£36,000) a month from performing on the adult site but now makes a fraction of that amount without her Instagram account driving traffic to it. BBC investigations into OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans Under the skin of OnlyFans The owner of a different adult website to the one suing OnlyFans told us his company was also affected but does not know how or why. He says that in late 2018 it had felt like a ""bomb"" had been placed under his business. More than 100 Instagram accounts which used to drive traffic to adult performers appearing on his site experienced a big loss in visibility and some were disabled altogether - he claims. He says his income dropped significantly. Meta said it was unable to comment on these claims without the usernames or names of the adult sites being promoted on their platforms. A spokesperson added that its guidelines set a high bar in recommending accounts which users were not already following. Content hashed on the database run by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism is not independently audited. But in a statement a spokesperson said: ""We are not aware of any evidence to support the theories presented in this lawsuit between two parties with no connection to GIFCT."" ""Our continuing work to enhance transparency and oversight of the GIFCT hash-sharing database is the result of extensive engagement with our stakeholders and has no connection to these claims.""

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here.

The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set
out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine. The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. Announcing500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals. President Biden said the measures wouldalso target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. The UKhas frozen the assets of six bosses at the prisonand banned them from travelling to the UK. The UK has also imposed new bans on Russianmetal, diamond and energy exports.

Hundreds of major firms, includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken,have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. However, some still do business in Russia. PepsiCo, for example, has been accused ofcontinuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered thatUS cosmetics firm Avonwas making goods in a factory near Moscow.

For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be.

""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said.

The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nicola Sturgeon is to unveil the Scottish government's plans for managing the Covid-19 pandemic in a ""much less restrictive"" way in future. The first minister will present a new ""strategic framework"" to MSPs in a Holyrood statement after 14:00. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all legal restrictions will end in England. Ms Sturgeon said her aim was to get back to normality while maintaining ""vigilance"" against future outbreaks. Her statement could detail when existing restrictions are to be lifted, although the first minister has cited testing and isolation as examples of measures which could continue to help keep the virus under control. PM sets out end of Covid restrictions in England Irresponsible to scrap Covid rules, says SNP chief Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk On Monday, Mr Johnson told MPs that all of England's legal restrictions would be lifted on Thursday - including the requirement to self-isolate for those who test positive - while free mass testing will stop in April. Routine contact tracing is to end, while close contacts of English positive cases will no longer be legally required to test daily, with the government encouraging people to exercise ""personal responsibility"" instead. The prime minister said he would ""continue to work closely with the devolved administrations as they decide how to take forward their own plans"". But Scottish ministers have called for clarity about what his announcement means for programmes and funding north of the border, with the mass testing system a UK-wide initiative. Questioned about funding in the Commons, Mr Johnson appeared to suggest the Scottish government would have to fund any continued free testing from its existing budgets. The Scottish government has been drawing up its own plans for managing the pandemic with fewer restrictions in future, due to be published on Tuesday afternoon. This could include dates for the ending of current restrictions including the vaccine passport system, along with details about testing and how any new variant could be dealt with. Boris Johnson has suggested the Scottish government would have to fund any continued free testing On Monday, Ms Sturgeon said it was important to ""strike the right balance"" between getting back to normal and continuing to control the virus. She said: ""There will be a lot of optimism around what I set out, but I've got to be frank with people - we are still in a pandemic of this virus, we know from past experience that new variants can come about and cause new challenges. ""We need to be vigilant and prepared for that, but we also need to manage that risk in a much less restrictive and more sustainable way for the future so we can get back to normal - and retain that sense of normality even as we maintain that sense of vigilance."" Ms Sturgeon meanwhile said certain measures should be seen as ""being part of what enables us to live with greater normality"", citing isolation and testing as being helpful in minimising the spread of Covid-19. Critics of Mr Johnson's plans for England have agreed that while there is need to pare back costly testing regimes, lifting all measures will significantly impact people in poor health and those on lower incomes. Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, said the decision to remove testing combined with scrapping self isolation measures would ""throw clinically vulnerable people under the bus"". Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, he said: ""It's going to be extremely difficult for them to go out and do anything in public with any level of confidence. I can't recall an instance where we've taken a pathogen which is so serious and just decide we're going to let it infect people and not take any action. ""If you're creating an environment where you're allowing the virus to transmit freely with no interventions, the more numbers of infection you have the higher the chance of mutation - that's just basic evolutionary biology."" Doctors have argued free lateral flow tests will reduce the risk of further mutations and help protect the clinically vulnerable Dr Andrew Buist from the British Medical Association's GPs committee also told the programme he hoped the Scottish government would retain free access to lateral flow testing in order to support people on lower or insecure incomes. He added: ""Doing the right thing is much easier if you're in a secure job but if you're not paid if you don't go to work or if you don't have the funds to buy the test kits there will always be temptation to go to work. ""Most people with Covid symptoms go to the assessment centres - they are due to shut down by Easter so I expect we'll see more people with Covid coming into general practice. So the retention of the ability for people to easily test themselves at home is essential."" However retail and hospitality figures have called for an end to certain measures including the Covid passport scheme and mandatory wearing of face masks. Pub owner Gavin Stevenson, who is a member of the Night Time Industry Association, argued that venues having to use the passport scheme are seeing an impact on trade - while others which do not need passport checks have recovered to 90% of pre-pandemic trading. ""A big challenge is the real lack of uptake of vaccine passports,"" he added. ""We're still seeing lots of people not realising they needed one to get in."" The first minister has said MSPs will be given the chance to debate and vote on the strategic framework, giving opposition parties the chance to outline their own proposals. The Scottish Conservatives have urged the government to put greater emphasis on ""trusting the public to act responsibly"", while phasing out the mass testing system and setting up long Covid clinics. Health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said: ""With the data on the virus being much more encouraging, we have to move away from blanket restrictions and instead trust the public to do the right thing."" Scottish Labour stressed that ""the virus has not gone away"", urging ministers in Edinburgh and London to co-operate rather than compete. Deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: ""When the people of Scotland most need co-operation between both of Scotland's governments, we are faced with the prospect of them taking opposing positions on the easing of restrictions. ""Both governments must make decisions that are grounded in science and in the real world."" Meanwhile, the Scottish Lib Dems want the government to drop the Covid passport scheme, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton calling it ""illiberal and ineffective"".

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set
out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Concerns have been raised over maintenance standards at one of Scotland's biggest hospitals. NHS Lothian has started formal dispute proceedings against Consort Healthcare, the private owner and operator of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). The health board has handed Consort a list of infrastructure issues that it says need to be rectified. The RIE is 20-years-old and was built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme. NHS Lothian said it was in dispute over the nature and delivery of the maintenance and upgrades required for the hospital but was ""working closely"" with Consort to address them. However, the health board also warned it could, if necessary, retain some of the PFI payments to Consort if the issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Private money, public controversy Warning over 'shameful' PFI leases lasting generations Warning over cost of repaying private finance deals The issue has been placed on NHS Lothian's risk register, where it warns there is a ""risk that facilities in the RIE are not fit for purpose because of a failure to carry out required life cycle works and maintenance of the estate"". The risk register lists heating, ventilation, water and window maintenance as some of the ""life cycle works"" that could present a problem. NHS Lothian said the risk register entry is not a statement of actual present issues but is used to ""anticipate and mitigate worst-case scenarios"". The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh was built by a private consortium which runs and maintains the facility for the NHS The PFI deal with Consort is expected to have cost the taxpayer more than Â£1bn by the time it expires in 2028. At that stage the deal with Consort to run and maintain the hospital can be extended for 25 years or NHS Lothian will have to negotiate a price to buy the facility. A spokesman for the trade union Unison, which has long campaigned against PFI deals, said: ""No one should be surprised that as their opportunity to extract cash draws to a close that profiteers will try and squeeze more revenue from the public purse.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek Lynn Williams cares for her husband Derek, who has a severe spinal injury. They've been isolating for some time. Ms Williams has concerns about what she has seen and heard so far about the Scottish government'sstrategic framework,external'. She tells Drivetime: ""We have to remember there's a dangerous pathogen still circulating and people remain at risk and I'm not sure the framework document addresses that in any great depth."" Ms Williams says she does not understand concerns people have about wearing a mask and making it a personal choice is ""a worry for us"". She says she wants people to have access to FFP2 masks and she expresses concerns that there are lots of things left unaddressed by the framework. ""It's not just anxiety - this is life and death for many families,"" Ms Williams adds. Question from Leire in Aberfeldy As it stands to count as
âfully vaccinatedâ international visitors to Scotland must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. Leireâs friend has only
had one so she must follow the rules for someone who has not been fully
vaccinated. That means she must:  She does not need to self-isolate on arrival but if she records a positive day two PCR test then she will need to follow thecurrent rules for self-isolating in Scotland,external. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Although many business sectors have criticised the pace of Scotland's restrictions easing, leading figures in the night time industry have praised the Scottish government's approach to testing. Nightclub owner Donald McLeod, who has long contested the use of Covid passports, said lateral flow testing was the best thing about the government's mitigations. Similarly Gavin
Stevenson, a member of Night Time Industry Association, said he was glad to see Scotland was maintaining its provision of free testing unlike England. However, both agreed that other measures such as Covid passports or face masks in hospitality settings were ineffective to begin with. Mr Stevenson said: ""If
youâre surrounded by people eating, drinking and not wearing face masks, itâs
been of little benefit for a long time so weâre very glad to see that change to
a more voluntary guidance basis. ""We have to trust people to do what they feel
is right for them â if staff want to wear masks theyâre very welcome to keep doing
so."" These Dundee shoppers said they were used to wearing masks and would be ""quite happy"" to wear them for ""a little bit longer"" and that they were ""the norm now"". ""Until somebody says this pandemic's finished, and there's no risk to us or anyone else, we just keep doing what we do,"" one shopper added. However, another woman said continued mask wearing was ""taking away your human rights."" She said: ""I wouldn't have even had them in the first place."" The announcement that the Covid passport scheme will
end on Monday has been hailed as âcommon senseâ by the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association. SLTA managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Calling a halt to Covid
passports is common sense and fantastic news for hospitality businesses,
particularly the late-night sector where restrictions over the last two years
have had such a severe impact. âHowever, the legal requirement to wear a face covering in indoor hospitality
and other settings for another month is not the news we wanted to hear today."" Mr Wilkinson said a ""very, very long and uphill struggle"" lay ahead for many
hospitality businesses. Question from David in Edinburgh Test and Protect is still operational but the first minister has confirmed a detailed plan setting out its longer term priorities will be published next month. Ms Sturgeon earlier told MSPs it will set out the Scottish government's aims in more
detail, and describe the scale of infrastructure that will remain in place beyond the spring. She added the plan will confirm the duration of any transition period during which the system will operate broadly on the same basis as it does now. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The public health reasons for ensuring a careful,
phased transition from the current arrangements to a more targeted testing
system are the most important."" The hospitality sector has voiced its agreement that ministers should be doing more to increase public confidence. Scottish Hospitality Group spokesman Stephen Montgomery argued that the continued use of face coverings could prevent people from going to venues. He said: ""There are a number of details which will require further thought and consultation, and we would have liked to see a clearer and faster transition to the end of restrictions and mandatory use of masks, as keeping these for a further month does nothing for rebuilding consumer confidence."" He welcomed the step towards normality and said the sector would continue to do all it could to keep customers safe. Question from Georgie in Broxburn The first minister used her Covid update to emphasise that in Scotland, for now, those who test positive for the virus will continue to be asked to isolate for therecommended period,external. At present anyone who tests positive, regardless of vaccination status, must self-isolate for 10 days. But since 6 January new cases have been advised they can end self-isolation if they donât have a fever and test negative on a Lateral Flow Device (LFD) on day six and, again, at least 24 hours later. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to make self isolation support
payments available to those who are eligible but added the recommended period of
isolation will be kept under review. She told MSPs: ""It is worth stressing that isolating when positive
with a highly infectious virus - and the follow-up tracing that Test and Protect does - remains one of the most fundamental public health protections
that we have available to us."" The first minister adds the strategy helps limit transmission overall and protects those most at risk from serious illness should they contract the virus. Small business owners have welcomed the news that legal restrictions would be wound down - but say work needs to begin immediately to get firms back on their feet. Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotlandâs policy chairman, said ministers need to give the public confidence over returning to a more normal way of life. He said: âWith
a new economic strategy in the pipeline, weâd urge ministers to ensure that the
local firms and self-employed people that gave up so much are at the centre of
their plans. ""And local authorities and the Scottish government must work
together to ensure that cash aimed at recovery reaches the real economy."" CBI Scotland have welcomed thestrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions as a ""significant step towards
normality returning"" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: âFirms
want the removal of remaining restrictions to be a springboard for confidence,
providing the certainty they need to invest and generating a much-needed boost
to the Scottish economy. ""But they are also aware that the virus hasnât
disappeared, so will continue to protect their staff and customers, as they
have from the outset. ""âLiving
confidently with the virus means prioritising infrastructure over
interventions. Firms will welcome the continued emphasis on our world-leading
vaccine and anti-viral programmes as the key pillars in our efforts to keep
people safe."" Ms Black goes on to say: âWhile
free testing cannot continue forever, mass lateral flow testing has helped keep
large parts or our economy open, and firms continue to believe the economic
benefits far outweigh the costs.â Coronavirus expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University
of Edinburgh, tells BBC Scotland News that further clarity on what is happening with testing is needed. She says Scotland is moving from a population protection approach to protecting individual at-risk groups - and testing is required to help the most vulnerable, for example for anti-viral treatments that can prevent people from going into hospital. However, she says the good news is that data from other countries indicates that Scotland's case numbers are likely to go down overall after a period of remaining static. The Scottish Retail Consortium has welcomed the publication of the  fullrefreshed Covid strategic framework,externaland the indicative date of 21 March for
rescinding of the regulations affecting shops. SRC director David Lonsdale said: âAfter a difficult winter of
regulations and restrictions retailers will welcome todayâs milestone
announcement of a clear timeframe for ending the remaining curbs and statutory
guidance that shops must follow. ""Nearly two years of restrictions have left
many retail businesses at breaking point; they will be relieved there is light
at the end of this long tunnel."" He continued: ""It will be up to retailers
and customers to continue to show consideration and good sense whilst Covid
remains a risk."" While the first minister has been talking, the Scottish government has published its fullstrategic framework,externaldocument outlining Scotland's route out of restrictions. In her foreword, Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Even though
the road ahead may yet be challenging at times â we know that recovery and
progress to a better future is now under way."" Ms Baillie raises a number of further issues, saying
the Covid framework is more like a âprogress reportâ. She asks the FM to set
out what âlow, medium and highâ risk levels mean and how they will be measured
in future. She also asks for more detail about testing categories
and support for those with long Covid. On risk levels, the FM says it would not be
appropriate not to rely on fixed thresholds because different variants will have a different impact. Ms Sturgeon insists there is a great level of detail in the
framework document. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie criticises the conflict between the UK and Scottish governments when she says they should be working together. She says the FM has suggested that testing will remain free of charge until the end
of March - but asks what will happen thereafter. Ms Sturgeon says that as late as Friday, the Scottish government was expecting the UK government to set out plans for how testing would be retained and how it would be funded - and that a cabinet meeting was postponed ""because they were still having conflict amongst
themselves"". She says she expects the Scottish government will extend free testing beyond the end of March but she needs to know what resources from the UK are available to support that. The first minister says Douglas Ross has opposed almost everything her government  has done during the pandemic. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will be driven by the data, the evidence and by the application of judgement."" She tells the chamber, in terms of testing, the transition to a more targeted programme should be ""careful and phased"". The first minister argues there was no clarity from the UK government on what it will retain in terms of testing or its funding, which is ""deeply regrettable"". She points out Covid has not gone away and contingency powers must be retained. Finallly she insists her ministers continually engage with businesses. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rising inflation led to government interest payments hitting a record high for the month of January, figures show. Interest payments hit Â£6.1bn last month, the highest amount for a January since records began in April 1997 and up from Â£4.5bn last year. The payments are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which reached 7.8% in January. January's interest payments were, however, below the all-time high of Â£9bn in June last year. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was worth noting that ""overall interest payments by the government are still at remarkably low levels"" despite UK debt levels at the highest for 60 years. ""Year after year interest payments have come in below expectations and that has given the chancellor additional wiggle room,"" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalgovernment finances recorded a surplus of Â£2.9bn last month as the economy opened up from lockdowns and tax receipts improved. The surplus compares with a Â£2.5bn deficit in January 2021 - when spending on coronavirus support measures was higher. However, the latest figure is still a Â£7bn smaller surplus than in January 2020, before the pandemic. Where does the government borrow billions from? UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2 UK finances are normally healthier in January as self-assessment income tax receipts come in. Revenues from self-assessed tax was Â£18.4bn last month, an increase of Â£2bn from a year earlier. Borrowing from the end of March to January was Â£138.5bn - the second highest for the period since records began in 1993. Mr Johnson told the BBC the figures showed ""we are still spending an awful lot more. We are poorer than we were."" But he said the bigger picture was that the deficit - the gap between spending and tax receipts - was coming down quickly. Some big tax rises this year will also mean the government borrowing less, he added. January is normally a month when the Treasury reaps the benefit of large tax payments from self-employed workers, with more money coming in than going out. The public sector finances were always going to look comfortable compared with the same month last year when the lockdown over Christmas and the new year dented economic activity. But a surplus of Â£2.9bn in January 2022 is still Â£7bn less than before the pandemic, reflecting the impact of Omicron. It's notable that borrowing in the financial year to date has more than halved, down by Â£140bn, before the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's forthcoming tax rises have taken effect. That illustrates a point already evident from the efforts in the past 13 years of successive chancellors, first Labour then Conservative, to fix the public finances by imposing austerity: namely, it's not so much what the chancellor does, but what the economy does, that most effectively cuts government borrowing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government had ""provided unprecedented support"" through the pandemic. ""But our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation,"" he said. ""Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments."" The ONS figures showed that total public sector debt stood at Â£2.32 trillion at the end of the month, or around 94.9% of gross domestic product. How does the government borrow money?

"Deaths in Scotland wholly linked to alcohol increased during the pandemic, despite consumption decreasing in general, new figures have shown. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said these deathswere 9% higher in 2020 than the annual average in 2017-19,external. It said the rise was driven particularly by males and those aged 45 to 64. These groups already had some of the highest alcohol-specific death rates before the pandemic. Public Health Minister Maree Todd said the Covid pandemic had affected society in many ways, adding that ""since the beginning we've taken action to assist those who are drinking at harmful levels"". The PHS report noted that there were fewer hospital admissions involving a diagnosis entirely attributed to alcohol, with rates 7.3% lower in 2020 than the average for the previous two years. Alcohol deaths at highest level for a decade Alcohol sales drop to lowest level in 26 years 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' 'Notable' fall in Scotland's alcohol death rate But it warned there were ""substantially reduced hospital admissions overall"", with a 30% reduction in all admissions to general acute hospitals in Scotland between 2019/20 and 2020/21. Researchers believe some drinkers increased their alcohol consumption at a time when there was reduced access to hospital treatment - and this could explain the higher rates of mortality. Lucie Giles, public health intelligence principal at PHS, said: ""Taken together, the evidence points to increased drinking amongst some groups, coupled with a reduction in the number of people accessing hospital treatment and greater rates of death caused by alcohol."" She said tackling alcohol consumption and harm, particularly among high-risk groups, should be a ""critical objective"" of any Covid-19 recovery plans. In response to the study, Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, which works to prevent alcohol harm, said: ""While it is positive that overall Scots drank less during the last two years, this needs to seen in the context of the devastating rise in deaths caused by alcohol during the same period. ""Drinking habits appear to have become polarised; some have cut down, while others - particularly heavier drinkers - have increased their drinking. ""In addition, it has been challenging for people to access the support they need, with reports of services being reduced or operating online for periods of time."" Public Health Minister Maree Todd said: ""Throughout the pandemic we allocated additional funding to extend outreach initiatives which identify people at risk, address their immediate health concerns, and get them the support they need. ""We're determined to go further, which is why we are focusing on reducing harms where they are greatest. To help achieve this we are consulting on potential restrictions on alcohol advertising, reviewing the level of the minimum unit price, and improving health information on product labels."" She added that there had also been more investment in tackling problematic alcohol and drug use along with residential rehabilitation. Purchases for consumption off premises, such as from supermarkets and shops, increased throughout the pandemic Alcoholic liver disease (64%) was the biggest cause of alcohol-related death (64% in both time frames), followed by mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use (27% in 2020 and 26% in 2017-19). Overall sales and consumption of alcohol decreased when Covid hit. Total combined alcohol sales (litres of pure alcohol per adult) were 9% lower in 2020 and 16% lower in 2021 (January to May) when compared with the 2017-19 average. On-trade alcohol sales, such as in pubs and bars, were  ""substantially lower"" - down 66% in 2020 and by 95% in the first five months of 2021 - although Covid restrictions would have contributed to this decrease. Despite the overall slump in alcohol sales, purchases for consumption off premises, such as from supermarkets and shops, increased throughout the pandemic. They noticeably ""spiked"" in the week before the first national lockdown, and subsequently went up by 13% in 2020 and 15% in 2021 (January to May), compared with the average for 2017-19. Alcohol consumption remained above recommended levels between the start of Covid-19 restrictions in March 2020 and May 2021. Seventeen units (171 ml) of pure alcohol were sold per adult each week on average, mostly from off-trade premises - enough alcohol to put every adult in Scotland over the chief medical officer's low-risk weekly drinking guideline of 14 units.

Hiut Denim Co. in Cardigan, Ceredigion. said European sales were 36% down, while production fuel costs are up 30%. Pero Foods, in Betws-y-Coed, Conwy county, said its European turnover was down 86%. But a UK minister said evidence Brexit had caused trade drops was""few and far between"". Last week Minister for Brexit Opportunities Jacob Rees-Mogg said Brexit was ""already a success"" and that he would be working to ""cut through the thicket"" of red tape. Dave Hieatt said Brexit had made trading harder It's exactly 20 years since the closure of the Dewhirst jeans factory in Cardigan. Hiut Denim Co. took on local workers' expertise and skills to produce jeans once again, earning fansincluding the Duchess of Sussex. The company's co-founder Dave Hieatt said he was having to work harder because of the adverse affects of Brexit. ""It's really disappointing because business is hard anyway,"" he said.

""And so Brexit unfortunately is not helping... it's just not helping."" Hiut is run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt The UKleft the EU's trading regimeon 1 January 2021, 11 months after it left the bloc - with its trade now governed by a post-Brexit trade deal. Since then, British businesses have experienced additional paperwork and border checks when exporting products to EU countries, something Mr Hieatt said was detrimental to business. ""Europe has been very important for us but since Brexit, our sales have been 36% down. Our production in fuel costs are 30% up, so it's definitely a little bit harder,"" he said. Pero Foods director Jonathan Rees said the company had seen decline of around 86% in its turnover into Europe Pero Foods said that since 2020/2021 it had lost about Â£750,000 worth of business to customers within the EU. Jonathan Rees, director of the natural pet food manufacturer, described the attitude from Westminster as ""quite dismissive"" and said he was not convinced things would get better. ""Brexit is having an astounding effect on us as a business,"" he said. ""We've seen a decline of around 86% in our turnover into Europe. ""The Republic of Ireland was a big customer and we've lost everything that went over to Ireland."" He added: ""Paperwork and the administrative side is one thing but because we're a small business, we can't fill lorries and so we have to be a part of another load, and many of the transport companies don't allow combining loads in case there's a problem with the paperwork of one delivery that could stop the rest of the goods from crossing the border."" A recent report by the Public Accounts Committee said new arrangements for the UK-EU border had added costs to exporting businesses. According to a cross-party committee of MPs, trade had been ""suppressed"" since the UK cut formal trade ties in January 2021, due a combination of Brexit, Covid and global economic problems. These factors combined have led to a decline in Welsh meat exports. In 2021, UK beef exports were down 11% on the previous year, with lamb seeing a 20% reduction. John Richards said the extra paperwork was hitting exporters Industry Development and Relations Manager at Meat Promotion Wales, John Richards, said there was no denying the pandemic had a significant impact on the industry, but Brexit still raised serious challenges; ""The biggest challenge we've had over the last year or so is the extra paperwork that's required in order to get products to be exported,"" he said. ""And that extra paperwork requires more resource, more time, and all this costs exporters money. ""In the short term, unfortunately, there's no quick fix."" He said exporting red meat to the EU was ""vitally important"". ""We export about a third of what we produce here in Wales, and around 95% of what we export ends up going into Europe."" Wales Office Minister David TC Davies MP insisted more opportunities were now available for businesses as markets have opened for Welsh companies in places such as Asia and Australia. ""We've had a very difficult year, because of Covid and companies around the world are suffering at the moment,"" he said. ""But now, the situation is looking very good.

"A new report on the impacts of climate change will likely be the most worrying assessment yet of how rising temperatures affect every living thing. This will be thesecond,externalof three major reports from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC) and its first since November's COP26 summit. Scientists and officials will publish theirconclusions,externalon 28 February. The study will focus heavily on regional impacts as well as on cities and coastal communities. Covid shutdown linked to record rainfall in China Five things we have learned from the IPCC report What was agreed at COP26? Record high deforestation of Amazon in January The IPCC carries out these large-scale reviews of the latest research on warming every six or seven years on behalf of governments. This set of three is their sixth assessment report. Researchers are formed into three working groups that look at the basic science, the scale of the impacts and the options for tackling the problem. For many major cities and developing countries, the report will highlight that tackling climate change is not about cutting emissions and hitting net zero sometime in the future, but about dealing with far more short-term threats. ""It is always the immediate, that takes precedence. So if you've got to deal with a big influx of migrants, or a massive flood event, that's where the focus is going to be,"" said Mark Watts, the executive director of the C40 group, a network of around 100 major cities that are collaborating to tackle climate change. ""In the global south, there really aren't any city climate programme funds at the moment. Of those that exist, almost none of them are about adaptation. They're all trying to get poor countries that have relatively low emissions, to reduce their emissions further, not about adapting to the impacts that they're already feeling."" In Kenya, prolonged drought has pushed pastoralists off their land Under the umbrella of the IPCC, scientists working on the report, who all volunteer for this work, review and write up thousands of papers to summarise the latest findings. They then meet with government officials to go through their findings line by line and, upon reaching consensus, a short summary of their findings is published. The study will also outline key ""tipping points"" that are likely to be passed as the world warms - some of which are irreversible like the disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet. The report will also look at some of the technological solutions to climate change, but is likely to be quite dismissive of efforts to manage solar radiation or even to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Overall it will have a much broader focus than just the science of what we can do about climate change. People clearing a sewer in Lagos Home to more than 24 million, Lagos in Nigeria is Africa's most populated city - but one that's hugely vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise.  Making the situation worse is the problem of rubbish and waste that collects in canals and rivers. Dealing with this issue could be key to helping the city cope with the changes brought about by a changing climate. ""One of the one of the things that needs to change in Lagos to reduce that flooding impact is actually to get a grip of the waste management system,"" said Mark Watts from C40.  ""Supportive investing in the city for them to get really strong municipal waste collection, proper household collection, and getting it properly treated is going to solve two things at once."" ""The report will talk about social justice more, and it will talk about sustainable development more. It does talk about indigenous and traditional knowledge, not just published Western science,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF. ""This is about the impacts on people and nature, the risks they face and the limits to adaptation as well."" The melting of Arctic sea ice in the summer may be an important tipping point for climate change But as scientists and officials meet virtually to thrash out the final details, a tussle has emerged over the use of a key phrase in the text. For years, developing countries have been trying to get the richer world to respond within UN climate negotiation to the issue of ""loss and damage"". They define the phrase to mean the impacts of climate change that countries cannot adapt to, including severe weather such as major storms but also slow-onset events like sea level rise or desertification. Richer countries have long opposed the concept, fearing they could be held legally and financially responsible for centuries for the disruption caused by historic emissions of carbon dioxide. As a result this issue has become ahugely divisive political issue within global climate talks. In this new report, the IPCC scientists are seeking to use a slightly amended version of the term, talking about ""losses and damages,"" which they say has a different, less political meaning. But officials from several richer governments attending the approval session have objected, fearing that if the idea appears in a key report, it will give backing to those countries who want ""loss and damage"" to be the top priority for international negotiations. A man runs from a fire in Colombia Ultimately this report will stress urgency - that if rapid action is taken on cutting greenhouse gases and spending on helping people adapt to climate change is ramped up, then the worst risks can be avoided. But this hope has to be measured against the reality of politics, according to co-chair Prof Hans-Otto PÃ¶rtner. ""One key message has come out of previous reports - political will, in terms of climate action, is the bottleneck for a sustainable future.""

"Rising inflation led to government interest payments hitting a record high for the month of January, figures show. Interest payments hit Â£6.1bn last month, the highest amount for a January since records began in April 1997 and up from Â£4.5bn last year. The payments are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which reached 7.8% in January. January's interest payments were, however, below the all-time high of Â£9bn in June last year. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was worth noting that ""overall interest payments by the government are still at remarkably low levels"" despite UK debt levels at the highest for 60 years. ""Year after year interest payments have come in below expectations and that has given the chancellor additional wiggle room,"" he said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalgovernment finances recorded a surplus of Â£2.9bn last month as the economy opened up from lockdowns and tax receipts improved. The surplus compares with a Â£2.5bn deficit in January 2021 - when spending on coronavirus support measures was higher. However, the latest figure is still a Â£7bn smaller surplus than in January 2020, before the pandemic. Where does the government borrow billions from? UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2 UK finances are normally healthier in January as self-assessment income tax receipts come in. Revenues from self-assessed tax was Â£18.4bn last month, an increase of Â£2bn from a year earlier. Borrowing from the end of March to January was Â£138.5bn - the second highest for the period since records began in 1993. Mr Johnson told the BBC the figures showed ""we are still spending an awful lot more. We are poorer than we were."" But he said the bigger picture was that the deficit - the gap between spending and tax receipts - was coming down quickly. Some big tax rises this year will also mean the government borrowing less, he added. January is normally a month when the Treasury reaps the benefit of large tax payments from self-employed workers, with more money coming in than going out. The public sector finances were always going to look comfortable compared with the same month last year when the lockdown over Christmas and the new year dented economic activity. But a surplus of Â£2.9bn in January 2022 is still Â£7bn less than before the pandemic, reflecting the impact of Omicron. It's notable that borrowing in the financial year to date has more than halved, down by Â£140bn, before the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's forthcoming tax rises have taken effect. That illustrates a point already evident from the efforts in the past 13 years of successive chancellors, first Labour then Conservative, to fix the public finances by imposing austerity: namely, it's not so much what the chancellor does, but what the economy does, that most effectively cuts government borrowing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government had ""provided unprecedented support"" through the pandemic. ""But our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation,"" he said. ""Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments."" The ONS figures showed that total public sector debt stood at Â£2.32 trillion at the end of the month, or around 94.9% of gross domestic product. How does the government borrow money?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Russian actions in Ukraine are a ârenewed invasion of that countryâ The UK has announced a series of sanctions against Russia after it ordered troops into two rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine. Five banks have had their assets frozen, along with three Russian billionaires - who will also be hit with UK travel bans. Boris Johnson said Russia's actions amounted to a ""renewed invasion"" and the sanctions were a ""first barrage"". He stressed these could be extended - but faced calls for tougher action now. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on Monday, after recognising them as independent. President Putin said the troops would be ""peacekeeping"" in the breakaway regions - a claim dismissed by the US as ""nonsense"". How much Russian money is there in the UK? What sanctions could be imposed on Russia? The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis Mr Johnson announced the sanctions against Russian individuals and banks in a statement to MPs, after an emergency meeting early on Tuesday. The effort comes as part of a co-ordinated Western response to the crisis, which has also seen the EU and US impose sanctions of their own. The Foreign Office later announced the UK would also sanction Russian parliamentarians who voted to recognise the two-rebel held areas as independent last week. The sanctions will be similar to those already imposed on the three billionaires, but could take weeks to enforce as new legislation will be required. The department said that in the coming weeks British firms would also be prevented from doing business in the two breakaway areas - similar to Crimea, a region Russia illegally annexed in 2014. It added ""unprecedented"" measures targeting the Russian financial sector had been prepared if Russia went further, and threatened to stop Russia issuing sovereign debt on UK financial markets if it did not ""de-escalate"". Mr Johnson accused the Russian president of denying Ukraine's statehood, and ""establishing the pretext for a full-scale offensive"". He said Russian tanks had already been ""spotted"" in the breakaway regions, amounting to a ""renewed invasion"" of Ukraine after the 2014 crisis. This video can not be played Labour's Keir Starmer: ""Putin appears determined to plunge Ukraine into a wider war"" The EU has also announced plans to target members of the Russian parliament, as well as banks financing Russia's military. In addition, Germany has said it will freeze approval of theNord Stream 2 gas pipelineto Russia - a move welcomed by Mr Johnson. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed British sanctions, but said the UK ""must be prepared to go further"". He called for Russia to be excluded from the global Swift payment system, the banning of trading in Russian sovereign debt and action to prevent Russia ""broadcasting its propaganda around the world"", a reference to the RT news channel. Russia orders troops into eastern Ukraine Is Russia invading Ukraine? Sir Keir said he understood the government wanted to delay introducing some sanctions as a tactic to deter a Russian invasion of the rest of Ukraine, but without a ""full set of sanctions now"" President Putin would conclude that ""the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs."" Senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said there were ""serious flaws"" in the new sanctions regime, and expressed concern it would not affect ""oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey were among MPs who welcomed the sanctions announced, but also urged the prime minister to go further. At times of actual war, economic war always plays it part. Sanctions aim to put pressure on governments and nations, by limiting their flows of trade and finance. But punches were clearly pulled in the moves announced by the UK against Russia's hostile actions in Ukraine. A limited number of small banks and Putin allies will face sanctions. Some of this is by design, to allow for retaliatory escalation. But it is difficult not to detect a familiar pattern, of treading very carefully, in the face of Russian hostilities, ranging from the invasion of Georgia, to the 2006 attack on Alexander Litvinenko in the UK. Bill Browder, formerly Russia's biggest foreign investor, arch Putin-critic, and architect of the ""Magnitsky"" laws said he was disappointed, describing the sanctions announced as ""very tepid"". He said the UK had the power to sanction 50 oligarchs close to Putin with money in the UK. ""By not taking that decision, he's sending a message to Putin, which is that nothing bad will happen if you do this type of stuff,"" he added. Certainly, the incremental approach to applying sanctions gives these fabulously wealthy men, ample chance to reorganise their finances, retail their yachts, and minimise the impact of any further harsher moves. By far the most impactful measure today was the German announcement of a pause on the completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The Russian stock market fell, and the market gas price rose 10%. Although it doesn't affect existing supplies, it does mark what could be a change in direction from Russian gas-addicted Berlin. Mr Johnson later said he thought further sanctions were ""inevitable"" given the situation in Ukraine. He also suggested Russia should be stripped of hosting this season's Champions League Final. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she had ""serious concerns about the sporting events due to be held in Russia"" and would be discussing the subject with sport's governing bodies. Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin was told his country would ""pay the price for its actions"" after he was summoned to the Foreign Office. Billionaire Boris Rotenberg is among three men to be sanctioned by the UK Putin allyGennady Timchenkois a billionaire hockey enthusiast with wide business interests in energy, transportation and construction via his Volga investment group. The UK government has accused him of supporting a Russian policy of destabilising Ukraine through his association with Bank Rossiya, of which he is a major shareholder. Igor Rotenberg, another close associate of President Putin, is the oldest son of Arkady Rotenberg and the majority shareholder in the Gazprom Drilling company. Igor's uncle,Boris Rotenberg, has also been targeted. Mr Rotenberg is the co-owner - along with his brother Arkady - of the SGM group, the largest construction company for gas pipelines and electrical power supply lines in Russia. The UK's sanctions notice says he is ""benefiting from or supporting"" the Russian state in his role in a key strategic sector. Rossiyais a privately-owned bank, which also has stakes in a television company. TheBlack Sea Bankis a Crimean bank and was created in 2014 after Russia annexed the region. TheGeneral Bankis a financial institution which also operates in Crimea. Promsvyazbankis a Russian state-owned bank, which the UK government says provides funding to Russia's military. The BBC's Business correspondent Theo Leggett says the UK was not targeting the biggest banks but banks known to be used by President Putin's inner circle. Are you in Ukraine?

However, the latest figure is still a Â£7bn smaller surplus than in January 2020, before the pandemic. Where does the government borrow billions from? UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2 UK finances are normally healthier in January as self-assessment income tax receipts come in. Revenues from self-assessed tax was Â£18.4bn last month, an increase of Â£2bn from a year earlier. Borrowing from the end of March to January was Â£138.5bn - the second highest for the period since records began in 1993. Mr Johnson told the BBC the figures showed ""we are still spending an awful lot more. We are poorer than we were."" But he said the bigger picture was that the deficit - the gap between spending and tax receipts - was coming down quickly. Some big tax rises this year will also mean the government borrowing less, he added. January is normally a month when the Treasury reaps the benefit of large tax payments from self-employed workers, with more money coming in than going out. The public sector finances were always going to look comfortable compared with the same month last year when the lockdown over Christmas and the new year dented economic activity. But a surplus of Â£2.9bn in January 2022 is still Â£7bn less than before the pandemic, reflecting the impact of Omicron. It's notable that borrowing in the financial year to date has more than halved, down by Â£140bn, before the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's forthcoming tax rises have taken effect. That illustrates a point already evident from the efforts in the past 13 years of successive chancellors, first Labour then Conservative, to fix the public finances by imposing austerity: namely, it's not so much what the chancellor does, but what the economy does, that most effectively cuts government borrowing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government had ""provided unprecedented support"" through the pandemic. ""But our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation,"" he said. ""Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments."" The ONS figures showed that total public sector debt stood at Â£2.32 trillion at the end of the month, or around 94.9% of gross domestic product. How does the government borrow money?

"This video can not be played Graphic designer Melin Edomwonyi, from Cardiff, runs a business selling T-shirts The struggle to find finance, a tricky work-life balance and a lack of confidence are all recognised barriers for female entrepreneurs. But are there additional issues facing black and multi-racial women in business? Official figures show that of the more than 5,000 start-ups supported by Business Wales in the past five years, 58% have been by women and 10% by black, Asian and minority ethnic people. There is not a breakdown to show how many of the latter percentage are women. Wales'Economy Minister Vaughan Gethingsaid he recognised it could be exhausting working twice as hard just to get your foot in the door. These women have spoken to BBC Wales about the additional hurdles they say they face. Graphic designer Melin Edomwonyi sells slogan T-shirts to empower and motivate people Melin Edomwonyi from Cardiff has worked in the creative industries for more than 15 years. She is a graphic designer who, after a bad break-up, recently started a small business selling slogan T-shirts aimed at empowering and motivating people. Black minister 'mistaken for restaurant staff' Being black in business is being 'on your own' Campaign for black businesses has been 'extraordinary' The 38-year-old has mixed Turkish and Nigerian heritage and identifies herself as ""mixed-black"". She describes ""feeling pressure"" to be a visible role model to other young entrepreneurs. ""I want people of colour, young peopleâ¦to feel encouraged and to see what I didn't see when I was growing up"" she said. Melin Edomwonyi The creative director said she fought insecurities about appearing on-camera and public-speaking to make sure she is seen. ""It's been such a rare occasion for me to see women of colour in the position that I am now... so because of that reason I feel like I want to show up"", she added. The designer, has invested her own money into her 'Lil Titsy' business to keep it going. She said in her experience it could be a challenge for relatives to see entrepreneurship, or any creative industry, as a valid career choice. ""Something that I have personally experienced is that black and ethnic minority communities are very stuck on certain types of jobs,"" she said. ""I often find there are young people who want to be a designer, photographer or illustrator but they can't convince their family to do it because the thing in the family line is to become a doctor, an engineer, maybe even a teacher"" she added. Azaria Anaman says she knows of business owners who had taken steps to hide their ethnicity It was ""stumbling"" upon a start-up business workshop as a student at Cardiff University that changed Azaria Anaman's life. Chatting over zoom between back-to-back meetings for her two businesses, the 24-year-old described working three days a week to fund her entrepreneurship. Unlike most other graduates, she said one of her biggest fears when finishing her degree was losing vital business support and mentoring as she moved back to London. ""I had to like really sit down and think about whether I wanted to stay in Wales or not because the support... was so great"" she added. It makes sense, she said, to be the face of her false eyelash business, Eni Lashes, offering tips and tutorials online, but she knows other businesses owners who have taken steps to hide their ethnicity. ""I know of an entrepreneur who has a jewellery business, like diamonds and jewels and such, and on their social media page they wear gloves so they can't see the colour of their skin because it affects the sort of clients they get"" she said. Azaria Anaman said she knew of some business owners who had tried to hide their ethnicity The entrepreneur has Ghanaian heritage and does not have those concerns herself, but has wondered whether she could be disadvantaged as she seeks financing in future. ""Not having a lot of venture capitalists that are from a black background does affect the people that receive the funding"" she added. Mr Gething said he recognised the challenges faced. ""Given that...you're more likely to fail if you look like me than to succeed, regardless of talent, it would be surprising, frankly, if these attitudes weren't in every sphere in society,"" he added. Mr Gething said the statistics show the Welsh government was ""doing well"". This video can not be played ""We're still not in a position where we can say enough has been done"" Business Wales promotes entrepreneurship among young people, supporting new businesses and providing advice and support to established small businesses. It also offers financial support to help people access their services in the first place, such as helping a single parent pay for childcare so they can attend a workshop. Mr Gething said the organisation also ran a programme for role models as well as running outreach to refugee communities and in churches and mosques. The Welsh government added it was committed to supporting entrepreneurial women in Wales and had an action plan to increase participation. One of its recommendations is tailoring existing business support to meet the need of women entrepreneurs and recognising their different characteristics, culture and circumstances.

"Health Minister Robin Swann has said he will not be ""rushed"" into taking decisions on rules around the use of free mass testing in Northern Ireland. The government in England plans tobring it to an end from 1 April. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should be following Number 10's lead, but Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP have urged caution. In a tweet, Mr Swann said he would not base his decisions on ""timetables elsewhere"". ""I have asked officials to draw up policy options based on an appropriate, proportionate approach to testing in NI. In the meantime, there will be no changes to the current approach,"" he said.

Mr Swann added that testing ""will continue to have a role, especially in protecting the most vulnerable"", and that further discussions on funding would be required with London and his Stormont ministerial colleagues. Speaking at Stormont on Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted free testing to continue but it would come at a cost. ""We have to make a decision do we try and provide our own supply and the cost of that, in a situation where we can't take budgetary decisions, where departments only have the baseline they have to spend into the new financial year because of the absence of the executive. ""That makes it infinitely more difficult."" Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it would wrong for Northern Ireland to bring an end to free testing. Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was important that people are supported financially to test and self-isolate if required. However DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should follow England's move. He described the recent strains of the virus as being similar to the impact of the common flu and that Northern Ireland should change test and trace procedures. ""We don't do that kind of extensive test and trace for common flu, we don't ask people to self-isolate immediately, we don't ask businesses to be disrupted as a result of that. ""We ask people to engage in common sense. ""Test and trace was introduced at a time when we didn't have all of the means to combat Covid that we do today."" Ms Mallon said testing was ""an important means of controlling transmission"". The UK Treasury would save billions of pounds by scrapping or reducing the number of free tests ""Now to be saying, particularly to low income families, that they will have to pay for that is deeply, deeply concerning,"" said the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) minister. The justice minister said whether it is Covid-19 or other conditions, people should ""not be going into the workplace ill and passing it on to colleagues who may be vulnerable or have vulnerable members of families"". ""But for people to make that choice, they have to be able to test, they have to know they're unwell and have financial support to let them self-isolate,"" said Mrs Long.

No change to Covid test and trace rules in NI Johnson: Do not throw Covid caution to the wind From Thursday,people with a positive Covid-19 test in England no longer legally need to self-isolate and routine tracing will end. Remaining Covid restrictions are also being lifted in England, and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. Dr David Farren, from the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said free testing should remain and the government's decision could ""come back to bite us"". ""Testing people and isolating them is the way you stop the bug from jumping from one person to another and effectively the prime minister has removed two very important protections in England with that move,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday. The infection control doctor said there could be ""further spread"" because people may not be able to afford tests or take time away from work. This risked creating a ""two-tier"" health system, he added, ""the like of which we haven't seen within our NHS"". Dr David Farren said it was wrong to ask people to pay for Covid-19 tests Patricia McKeown, from the trade union Unison, said the pandemic had highlighted the importance of sick pay. But Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said there was a need to ""learn to live with"" coronavirus and ending testing ""is a choice about how we spend taxpayers' money"". Meanwhile, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, Patricia Donnelly, said mass vaccine centres will not be needed for the next roll-out of the Covid jab. Over the course of the pandemic, mass vaccination centres were set up across Northern Ireland to administer Covid-19 vaccines on larger scales at locations including the SSE Arena and the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast. Ms Donnelly also said health officials in Northern Ireland expect the roll-out to be extended to over-50s in autumn and ""are planning for it"". She said it had been expected there would be an annual vaccination programme, similar to how the flu vaccine is rolled out. Additional vaccines being made available for those aged 75 and over in 2022 could be facilitated by GPs, community pharmacies and health trusts, she said. This video can not be played Patricia Donnelly said additional jabs could be facilitated by GPs, community pharmacies and health trusts. About 155,000 people will be eligible for the booster jab, with the roll-out expected to begin in April. There must be a gap of at least six months since a previous dose. Those eligible for the booster vaccine are: adults aged 75 and over older adults in care homes people aged 12 and over with a weak immune system On Monday, Stormont ministers held talks with the UK government about future funding to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. At the weekend, ministers from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales wrote a joint letter to Michael Gove expressing fears that funding for testing was about to be cut.

"Concerns have been raised over maintenance standards at one of Scotland's biggest hospitals. NHS Lothian has started formal dispute proceedings against Consort Healthcare, the private owner and operator of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). The health board has handed Consort a list of infrastructure issues that it says need to be rectified. The RIE is 20-years-old and was built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme. NHS Lothian said it was in dispute over the nature and delivery of the maintenance and upgrades required for the hospital but was ""working closely"" with Consort to address them. However, the health board also warned it could, if necessary, retain some of the PFI payments to Consort if the issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Private money, public controversy Warning over 'shameful' PFI leases lasting generations Warning over cost of repaying private finance deals The issue has been placed on NHS Lothian's risk register, where it warns there is a ""risk that facilities in the RIE are not fit for purpose because of a failure to carry out required life cycle works and maintenance of the estate"". The risk register lists heating, ventilation, water and window maintenance as some of the ""life cycle works"" that could present a problem. NHS Lothian said the risk register entry is not a statement of actual present issues but is used to ""anticipate and mitigate worst-case scenarios"". The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh was built by a private consortium which runs and maintains the facility for the NHS The PFI deal with Consort is expected to have cost the taxpayer more than Â£1bn by the time it expires in 2028. At that stage the deal with Consort to run and maintain the hospital can be extended for 25 years or NHS Lothian will have to negotiate a price to buy the facility. A spokesman for the trade union Unison, which has long campaigned against PFI deals, said: ""No one should be surprised that as their opportunity to extract cash draws to a close that profiteers will try and squeeze more revenue from the public purse. ""This problem will be a recurring feature until we have public services run by the public sector for the public good rather than an ongoing cash cow for shareholders."" Susan Goldsmith, director of finance at NHS Lothian, said: ""As part of an ongoing process of infrastructure management, we have identified areas where NHS Lothian considers maintenance or replacements are required. ""We are working closely with Consort who have proposed a programme of maintenance works and some upgrades of critical systems. ""We are currently in dispute with our PFI providers on the nature and delivery of the works programme and if successful, we can deploy contractual levers to effect resolution, such as the retention of elements of the unitary payment.""

"Wayne Couzens is serving a whole-life prison sentence Two police constables and an ex-officer charged with sharing ""grossly offensive"" messages with Wayne Couzens have been named by prosecutors. PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and former officer Joel Borders, 45, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16 March. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had said it could not release their names Couzens, 49, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Met, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. PC Cobban and Mr Borders are each charged with five counts of sending grossly offensive messages on a public communications network. PC Neville faces two counts of the same offence. The alleged offences took place between April and August 2019, two years before the murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. The Met said the serving officers had been suspended from duty. Last week, when the charges were first announced, the CPS said that it could not release the men's names due to ""operational reasons"". But on Monday their identities were published, as is standard in criminal cases after charges have been brought. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said: ""I am deeply concerned to hear two serving officers and a former officer have been charged with these offences.

"Oil and gas prices climbed on Tuesday on fears the Ukraine-Russia crisis will disrupt supplies across the world. The price of Brent crudeoil, an international benchmark, touched a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine's east. But prices later moderated, despite Western countries responding with economic sanctions and moves to block a key Russian gas pipeline. Shares also stemmed early losses. After falling more than 1.5% in early trade on Tuesday, Wall Street turned up following remarks by US President Joe Biden outlining the US response. The Dow closed down 1.4%, however, while the wider S&P 500 slumped 1% and the Nasdaq fell 1.2%. Earlier,Japan's Nikkei 225 indexclosed 1.7% lower, and the Shanghai Composite fell nearly 1%, but share indexes in Europe and the UK ended roughly flat, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.1%. ""The West at the moment is treading fairly carefully,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at the brokers AJ Bell. Russia is the second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's top producer of natural gas. Measures forcing the country to supply less crude or natural gas would have ""substantial implications"" on oil prices and the global economy, said Sue Trinh of Manulife Investment Management. PM announces UK sanctions against Russia Russia recognises Ukraine separatist regions What sanctions could be imposed on Russia? The RAC warned the crisis would push up UK petrol prices further, after they hit a record 149.12p a litre on Sunday. ""Russia's decision to invade Ukraine is already causing oil prices to rise and will undoubtedly send fuel prices inexorably higher towards the grim milestone of Â£1.50 a litre [of unleaded petrol],"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""This spells bad news for drivers in the UK struggling to afford to put fuel in their cars."" But the steps announced by the US, UK and Europe so far fall short of what had been threatened in the event of invasion. The sanctions target financial institutions, elites and other government entities in Russia, in part aiming to restrict the Russian government's ability to raise money on Western financial markets. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also took the significant step of blocking the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany. ""If Russian goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further,"" US President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House. He also warned that defending Nato territory could come at a cost to the public in the form of higher energy prices. A Ukrainian service member in the Donetsk region Since the start of February, already-rising oil prices have jumped more than 10% amid the tensions. Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 a barrel due to a combination of the Ukraine crisis, a cold winter in the US, and a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world. ""Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it's really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps,"" she said. Russia has spent years preparing for this moment. In 2014, when Russian troops moved into Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine, it provoked a first round of international sanctions. And that taught Moscow an important lesson. Since then it's been setting up defences, moving away from relying on the dollar, and trying to sanction-proof the Russian economy. President Putin may be betting that he can withstand sanctions for longer than the West assumes. Read more Most of the oil and gas that the UK imports does not come from Russia, but it would nonetheless be affected by a rise in global prices. Average diesel prices in the UK hit 152.51p a litre on Monday, just below Sunday's record of 152.58p, the RAC said. UK wholesale gas prices have also jumped, with the UK price for April delivery up 9% and the cost for May up 10% to 191p per therm. However, that remained lower than the highs seen in December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. The economic inter-dependence between Russia and Europe is likely to limit Western actions going forward, said Shaistah Akhtar, an expert on sanctions law from the UK law firm Mishcon de Reya. But some of the restraint so far is deliberate, she added. ""They needed to allow some room to manoeuvre,"" she said. Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics said the tensions are likely to keep oil prices elevated, even if the West does not take more aggressive action. ""It is not in the economic interests of either Russia or the West to use trade in energy as a weapon against each other, but that is not to say it won't happen,"" he wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Even if the West does not implement direct sanctions on Russia's energy exports, tensions with Russia could keep oil prices higher for longer.""

""This spells bad news for drivers in the UK struggling to afford to put fuel in their cars."" But the steps announced by the US, UK and Europe so far fall short of what had been threatened in the event of invasion. The sanctions target financial institutions, elites and other government entities in Russia, in part aiming to restrict the Russian government's ability to raise money on Western financial markets. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also took the significant step of blocking the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany. ""If Russian goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further,"" US President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House. He also warned that defending Nato territory could come at a cost to the public in the form of higher energy prices. A Ukrainian service member in the Donetsk region Since the start of February, already-rising oil prices have jumped more than 10% amid the tensions. Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 a barrel due to a combination of the Ukraine crisis, a cold winter in the US, and a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world. ""Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it's really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps,"" she said. Russia has spent years preparing for this moment. In 2014, when Russian troops moved into Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine, it provoked a first round of international sanctions. And that taught Moscow an important lesson. Since then it's been setting up defences, moving away from relying on the dollar, and trying to sanction-proof the Russian economy. President Putin may be betting that he can withstand sanctions for longer than the West assumes.

Average diesel prices in the UK hit 152.51p a litre on Monday, just below Sunday's record of 152.58p, the RAC said. UK wholesale gas prices have also jumped, with the UK price for April delivery up 9% and the cost for May up 10% to 191p per therm. However, that remained lower than the highs seen in December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. The economic inter-dependence between Russia and Europe is likely to limit Western actions going forward, said Shaistah Akhtar, an expert on sanctions law from the UK law firm Mishcon de Reya. But some of the restraint so far is deliberate, she added. ""They needed to allow some room to manoeuvre,"" she said. Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics said the tensions are likely to keep oil prices elevated, even if the West does not take more aggressive action. ""It is not in the economic interests of either Russia or the West to use trade in energy as a weapon against each other, but that is not to say it won't happen,"" he wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Even if the West does not implement direct sanctions on Russia's energy exports, tensions with Russia could keep oil prices higher for longer.""
