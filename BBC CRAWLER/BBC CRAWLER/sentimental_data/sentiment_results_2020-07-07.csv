"FBI Director Christopher Wray, pictured in February, described a wide-ranging campaign by the Chinese government to disrupt US life The director of the FBI has said that acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the ""greatest long-term threat"" to the future of the US. Speaking to the Hudson Institute in Washington, Christopher Wray described a multi-pronged disruption campaign. He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. ""The stakes could not be higher,"" Mr Wray said. ""China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary,"" he added. The spying game: China's global network Could TikTok be banned in the US? The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order In a nearly hour-long speech on Tuesday, the FBI director outlined a stark picture of Chinese interference, a far-reaching campaign of economic espionage, data and monetary theft and illegal political activities, using bribery and blackmail to influence US policy. ""We've now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,"" Mr Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China."" The FBI director mentioned a programme called ""Fox Hunt"", which he said President Xi Jinping had ""spearheaded"" and he said was geared at Chinese nationals living abroad seen as threats to the Chinese government. ""We're talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations,"" he said. ""The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China's tactics to accomplish that are shocking."" 'I'm Asian, so I can never be American' Coronavirus: The US-China battle behind the scenes He continued: ""When it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide."" The programme was originally begun in 2015 to target people accused of corruption and has reportedly led to the capture of thousands of fugitives. However,reports of extraordinary rendition of political opponents by Beijing have multiplied in recent years, starting with Gui Minhai, one of a group of Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in Chinese custody. Unlike the others, Mr Gui disappeared abroad - in Thailand - rather than from Hong Kong itself. China is fast becoming a new kind of threat to the West, not so much because of its growing military capabilities - though that is a factor - but because in economic and technical terms it is already a peer competitor of the United States, and a peer competitor in a very different kind of world. Nineteenth Century great powers competed more or less on equal terms but operated in a far less integrated international system. In the second half of the 20th Century, the Soviet Union was a peer military competitor of the United States, but with a relatively weak economy largely isolated from the wider international system. China, however, has huge and growing economic muscle. It shares much of the same economic space with the West and its dominance of crucial supply chains - think medical PPE for example - only enhances its power. The level of integration of today's globalised world and the importance of data and information only act as force multipliers for Beijing's overt and covert global reach. In the unusual address, Mr Wray asked Chinese-born people living in the US to contact the FBI if Chinese officials target them seeking their return. The Chinese government has defended this programme in the past, saying it is part of a legitimate anti-corruption effort. The threat posed by China will be further addressed by the US attorney general and secretary of state in coming weeks, Mr Wray said. This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US The address comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China. US President Donald Trump has been highly critical of China amid the coronavirus outbreak, repeatedly blaming the country for the global pandemic. In another move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the administration was looking at banning Chinese apps - including the hugely popular TikTok. The apps ""serve as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state"", he said.

"Three major online retailers have dropped fast fashion brand Boohoo over allegations of low pay and unsafe conditions at a supplier's factories. Next dropped Boohoo clothes from its websites last week, while Asos and Zalando followed suit on Tuesday. This followsa Sunday Times reportclaiming workers at a Leicester factory were paid Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. Boohoo said if the reports were true, conditions were ""totally unacceptable"". The company, which also owns the Nasty Gal and PrettyLittleThing brands, has denied any responsibility but said it would ""thoroughly investigate"" the claims. In a statement it said: ""We will not hesitate to immediately terminate relationships with any supplier who is found not to be acting within both the letter and spirit of our supplier code of conduct."" The fast fashion retailer declined to comment on the moves made by Next, Asos and Zalando. Boohoo's shares fell a further 12% on Tuesday after a 16% slump the day before, following the publication of the allegations in the Sunday Times. Boohoo was already under fire after Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firmwere ""being forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". At the time Boohoo said it would ""not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance especially in relation to the treatment of workers within our supply chain"". ""Next concluded there is a case for Boohoo Group to answer,"" said a spokesman for the retailer. ""As a result, last week Next removed the Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing branded items it was selling previously, from all Next websites."" The company said it has set up its own investigation over the claims. ""Next is not pre-judging the outcome of this process and no final decision has been made, however, while there is a case to answer, these labels will remain suspended from all Next websites,"" the spokesman said. Zalando, the Berlin-based online fashion store which had â¬6.4bn (Â£5.8bn) sales last year, said it ""has made the decision to delist all products by Boohoo Group and subsidiaries and pause all new business with Boohoo effective 7 July"". It said the health and safety of workers has remained of utmost importance to the company. During the coronavirus crisis Zalando said it had introduced ""strict preventative measures to keep all employees safe while staying open for business"". ""We expect our partners to apply similar fundamental priorities and will distance ourselves from those who don't,"" the firm added. Zalando said it will take action ""to address endemic human rights issues identified with Boohoo and in their supply chain"". ""Only once all corrective actions have been satisfactorily addressed by Boohoo, can a conversation be revisited to discuss the commercial relationship between Zalando and the Boohoo group moving forward."" Asos, meanwhile, has temporarily suspended its trading relationship with all Boohoo brands. It is understood the suspension will remain pending the outcome of Boohoo's investigation.

"More than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led air strikes, the UN says The UK is to resume arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite concerns they could be used against civilians in Yemen, in violation of international humanitarian law. Sales were suspended last year after a legal challenge by campaigners. A subsequent review found ""isolated incidents"" of possible violations but no pattern of non-compliance and ""no clear risk"" of future serious breaches. The Campaign Against the Arms Trade said it was a ""morally bankrupt"" move. It accused the government of ""rank hypocrisy"" after, on Monday, it banned 20 senior Saudi officials from entering the UK and frozen their assets in connection with the 2018 killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Labour said the government's ""mixed messages...undermined the UK's claim to be human rights defenders"". The UK's support for the Saudi-led international coalition in Yemen, which is backing the country's government in its battle against a long-running Houthi insurgency, has proved highly controversial. UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? UK arms sales to Saudi unlawful, court rules Thousands of people, including many civilians, have been killed in the five-year conflict, while millions have been made homeless or left starving. The UN has verified the deaths of at least 7,700 civilians since 2015 and said 60% of these were due to bombing raids by the Saudi-led coalition, whose other members include the United Arab Emirates. Monitoring groups believe the toll is far higher with the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project identifying 12,000 civilians killed in direct attacks. According to campaigners, the UK has licensed Â£5.3bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia since 2015. British officials have provided military advice to the Saudi-led coalition, including on bombing targets and tactics. Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". The UK was forced to review its policy after the Court of Appeal ruled in June 2019 that its decision-making process was unlawful as no attempt had been made to assess whether serious breaches had occurred in Yemen. In a statement, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the UK had now analysed individual allegations of abuses, using new methodology, to determine whether there had been a ""historic pattern of breaches"". While some of these incidents were assessed as ""possible"" violations, she said they ""occurred at different times, in different circumstances and for different reasons and the conclusion is that these are isolated incidents"". A Saudi-led multinational coalition intervened in the conflict in Yemen in March 2015 ""In the light of all that information and analysis, I have concluded that...Saudi Arabia has a genuine intent and the capacity to comply with international humanitarian law,"" she said. ""On that basis, I have assessed that there is not a clear risk that the export of arms and military equipment to Saudi Arabia might be used in the commission of a serious violation."" She said sales could resume and the ""backlog"" of individual licences which have accumulated since last June would be cleared subject to them meeting UK and EU criteria. The Campaign Against The Arms Trade said the government's decision was ""disgraceful"". ""The Saudi-led bombardment of Yemen has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and the government itself admits that UK-made arms have played a central role on the bombing,"" it said. ""The evidence shows a clear pattern of heinous and appalling breaches of international humanitarian law by a coalition which has repeatedly targeted civilian gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and market places. ""The government claims that these are isolated incidents, but how many hundreds of isolated incidents would it take for the government to stop supplying the weaponry?"" Labour said they would be pressing Ms Truss to explain her decision to Parliament. ""Even by this government's standards, their decision to resume the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen is morally indefensible,"" said shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry. ""At a time when millions of Yemeni children are facing the mortal threat of starvation and disease, Britain should be working flat out to bring this terrible war to an end, not selling the arms that continue to fuel it."" The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman, Alyn Smith, said the government had ""repeatedly and disgracefully put profits before peace"". The UK has long sought to broker a political settlement to the conflict in Yemen while backing the government in its effort to defeat the rebels. But it has been criticised for not taking tougher line with Saudi Arabia, which is a longstanding defence and intelligence ally of the UK. Germany banned all arms exports to Saudi Arabia in 2018 following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government.

"The news 4x4 Grenadier design was only revealed at the start of July Plans to build a new 4x4 vehicle plant in Wales have been put on hold by the firm Ineos. The company said it follows talks with Mercedes-Benz over the acquiring of their Hambach site in Moselle, France. The Wales plant would have been built next to the current Ford engine plant at Bridgend, which is to shut this autumn with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Economy Minister Ken Skates said it would be ""a real blow if Ineos reneged on its very public commitment"". ""I have told the CEO that abandoning Bridgend at this late stage, after so much effort and money has been invested in preparing the site, would be a terrible decision for Wales and the UK,"" said Mr Skates. ""We have impressed on the company in no uncertain terms the importance of honouring its commitment to Wales and to deliver on its promise to build a British icon here in Britain."" Almost no cars made during April lockdown Getting your car out of lockdown The Welsh Government added it had invested ""significant time and money"" and would look to recoup appropriate costs from the company if it pulled out. A UK government spokesman said: ""Today's news from Ineos is disappointing but we will continue to work alongside the Welsh Government to support the automotive industry in south Wales."" The new factory was expected to create about 200 jobs initially to make the new all-terrain Grenadier vehicle. It was hoped it could employ up to 500 people in the longer-term, and work to clear ground at the site had already begun. Work on another site in Portugal has also been suspended. Ineos had said the new Bridgend plant would eventually employ 500 people and produce 25,000 cars a year ""Some new options, such as this one with the plant in Hambach, have opened up that were simply not available to us previously,"" said Dirk Heilmann, the chief executive of Ineos Automotive. ""We are therefore having another look - and reviewing whether the addition of two new manufacturing facilities is the right thing to do in the current environment."" Mercedes-Benz put the Daimler car assembly plant in France up for sale last week. It was dedicated to its smart car, called the EQ fortwo, which has been recently developed. Ineos said it made the location ""ideally suited"" to the Grenadier. The company said Covid-19 had also had an impact on its building schedule for the new plants. ""Safety is of course paramount, but we also have an obligation to do what is right for the business - and so need to assess these new opportunities in order to maintain or improve on our timelines,"" said the Ineos Automotive chief. Elizabeth Davies, Leanne Rowlands and Steve Hone ""It's a shame because there's so many people out of work anyway,"" said Elizabeth Davies. ""It's sad because we're going to be in a bit of a mess."" Steve Hone said he was ""disappointed"" at Ineos's decision as its plans ""would have been good for the area"" with Ford closing its factory. ""We've seen a lot of places shut over the last 20 years with Sony closing and other factories on the estate, and Ford is the last big employer so Ineos was a chance for the future."" Leanne Rowlands said the town was ""struggling"". ""The shops are half empty, let alone the manufacturing businesses,"" she said. ""It's very sad."" BridgendMember of the SeneddCarwyn Jones, the former first minister of Wales, said: ""I don't accept for one minute that this had anything to do with covid. ""This is a decision that they don't want to invest in the UK - there's nothing more to it in my opinion,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru. ""I've heard a lot of things in politics over the years, but I've never seen this before, when a company say that they want to support the UK, but once the money's on the table, that's not what they do. ""I'm incredibly angry. There was an agreement and they've gone back on that."" This is a huge blow for Bridgend. It had been hoped that some of the workers losing their jobs at the nearby Ford plant could find work at Ineos. A lot of work also has gone into preparing suppliers to ensure the Welsh automotive industry benefited. The site is still being prepared for what would have been the Ineos plant. Work is continuing and there is some hope that it could be put to good use by attracting other companies to Bridgend. Even before this announcement there was interest from other businesses in moving to the area but those talks are at an early stage. It is unclear how much demand there has been for the Ineos Grenadier. Bridgend MP Jamie Wallis said he was ""disappointed"" by the announcement, and said it was a ""massive blow"" to the local economy and the economy of Wales. ""I have already spoken to the Wales Office and I am seeking urgent clarification about the implications of the future plant in Bridgend from Ineos and what more can be done from both governments at either end of the M4,"" he said. ""We need to do all we can to get the work back on track and secure this investment for workers and families in Bridgend."" A decision on where the new vehicle will be built will now be made ""in the next few weeks"" The leader of Bridgend council Huw David said the decision was ""disappointing"". ""The need for fresh investment into Bridgend county borough is now greater than ever, and we require urgent clarity not only over what Ineos intends to do, but on what action the Welsh government and the UK government will be taking in response to this latest development,"" he added. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones MS said: ""The fact that a site on mainland Europe appears to be favoured over a site in Wales may be a sign of what we risk, post-Brexit. ""It is very important that Welsh government seeks to understand the full picture from Ineos, engage with them and try to change their minds."" Ineos said it expected to complete its review of building options ""in the next few weeks"".

The head of the UK's national academy of science has called for everyone to carry a face covering when they leave home in order to tackle coronavirus. Currently, face coverings are compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, but advised to be worn elsewhere. From 10 July, masks will be required in shops. In Wales and Northern Ireland coverings are not compulsory. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, said the coverings should then be worn ""whenever you are in crowded public spaces"". He said evidence shows they protect the wearer and those nearby, and the UK was ""way behind"" other countries in usage. No 10 said the use of face masks is always kept ""under review"".

If you didn't think you'd ever see the Duchess of Cornwall and TikTok in the same sentence, well neither did we. Camilla - who is married to Prince Charles - has been speaking to Dame Judi Dench about their shared experience of having to use the internet in lockdown to keep in touch with family. Camilla guest edited The Emma Barnett show for BBC Radio 5 Live today. Dame Judi told Camilla about her new found fame on TikTok (largely thanks to her grandson) saying: ""I love TikTok stardom better than anything."" Parents of school-age children in Wales are still waiting to find out exactly what will happen in the new term in September. Now Education Minister Kirsty Williams has said any decision on how schools will return will be based on coronavirus transmission rates. Regular reviews are to be carried out during the summer, she says. She hopes to outline her plan for pupils this week. Pressure has been growing on the Welsh government to reveal how many schools might return.Read the full story here. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes The country's new president has insisted on a tougher stance Burundi  has launched a mass testing campaign for
coronavirus, in a fresh campaign by the new government to fight the spread of the
pandemic. Former president Pierre Nkurunziza was accused of
downplaying the issue, saying ""God had cleared [coronavirus] from Burundi's skies"", almost a fortnight before he died last month of cardiac arrest. But last week, his successor Evariste Ndayishimiye, declared
coronavirus a ""major enemy of Burundians"" and vowed ""to start the fight against
that enemy"". At the launch of the
campaign in Bujumbura, many people were, unusually, seen wearing masks. A record 640 tests were taken on the day, the highest number since March when the virus was first reported in the country. Burundi has so far reported 191 cases from 3,200
tests done in the past three months. Your fringe is sweeping your chin, you can comb your leg hair and you've got a monobrow. Before anyone puts finger to keyboard to complain, all of these things are FINE if that's your look. However, if you are feeling the need for a bit of bodily grooming,here's a handy guideto what we know so far about reopening hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons in Wales (and what no-one knows yet).

According to a report from the state's Agency for Health Care Administration, the hospitals are spread out across 25 of the state's 67 counties. More than 300 hospitals were included in the report, but not all of those have ICUs. Cases of the virus have surged in US southern states, including in Florida. In the last week, Florida has recorded more than 10,000 new cases in a 24-hour period three times in the last week. The state's total death toll is now more than 3,800. We will be hearing from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, as he delivers his summer statement. Among those particularly interested in what he has to say are some of the young people whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So is there anything the chancellor could announce in his speech on Wednesday to help them? BBC Business spoke to some of themto find out. At least 84 prisoners and nine prison guards and employees have died from the coronavirus so far, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The latest victim was Correctional Officer V Kenneth Harbin, 60, who died on 4 July. According to figures released last week by Texas officials, 8,811 offenders and 1,556 employees have tested positive. Prisons and jails around the US have been outbreak epicentres since the early days of the pandemic. Inmates have no ability to practice social distancing and sometimes little access to basic hygiene products such as soap and warm water. In California, San Quentin prison has been hit by a deadly outbreak after infected prisoners were transferred there from another facility. As of Monday, six San Quentin inmates have died and another 1,387 inmates have tested positive. Officials say they are urgently trying to reduce the prison's population to below 3,000. San Quentin prison is the worst affected detention centre in California We reported earlier that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro hastested positive for coronavirus. Now, footage shows him removing his mask in front of a group of reporters. Shortly after confirming his test result, he stepped back a few feet and took off the mask. He then told journalists that he looked ""fine"". Mr Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, and has called it a ""little flu"". This video can not be played The number of Covid-19 deaths and infections in Brazil is second only to the US Dr Mike Ryan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization (WHO), has sent his'get well soon' wishes to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaroand said that his infection should serve as an example for others. ""We wish him a speedy and full recovery from this disease,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the message to us all is: we are vulnerable to this virus.â WHO regional director Carissa Etienne echoed his comment while speaking from Washington DC to the directors of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). ""This is a pandemic of staggering proportions and we have no option but to continue to put all our energy into controlling it,"" she warned. PAHO director for communicable diseases Marcos Espinal added: ""The message is that this virus in unpredictable and does not respect race, class or people in power, despite security around any president."" Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent This morning I installed Ireland's just-released contact-tracing app on my phone, where it joined Germany's Corona Warn-App, which was released three weeks ago. Gibraltar recently released its Beat Covid Gibraltar app, based on the Irish code. The Republic's Covid Tracker software is also the foundation of an app Northern Ireland is promising to release within weeks. And now there's a hint Wales could go the same way. ""We remain in discussion about a range of options to achieve a working app, including development in Northern Ireland,"" a Welsh Government spokesman told the BBC. So when is England finally going to get its app? Find out more here. The US ambassador to Brazil, who hosted President Jair Bolsonaro at an American Independence Day Party over the weekend, will undergo testing amid news that the Brazilian leader has been infected with Covid-19. On Saturday, Mr Bolsonaro was photographed by the Brazilian foreign minister embracing US Ambassador Todd Chapman at the 4 July celebration. After Mr Bolsonaro displayed Covid-19 symptoms on Monday, the US embassytweeted,external(in Portuguese) that Mr Chapman ""has no symptoms, but he is taking precautions"". The US statement added that he will be tested and and will ""follow the screening protocols"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US federal government will pay $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) to drug maker Novavax to produce 100m coronavirus doses. The payment is the largest made so far by theUS ""Operation Warp Speed""- a partnership between the federal government and the private sector to find acoronavirus vaccine- and the fourth made to a drug manufacturer. Novavax, which is based in Maryland, has never before brought a product to market, according to the New York Times. âAdding Novavaxâs candidate to Operation Warp Speedâs diverse portfolio of vaccines increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,â US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement on Tuesday. Novavax CEO Stanley Erck told CNN on Monday that the deal with the US government ""speaks to the confidence that they have in our platform to be able to develop a vaccine"". He added that the company aims to ship out 100m vaccination doses by February 2021. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took his fourth coronavirus test on Monday after developing Covid-19 symptoms, has tested positive for the virus. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks posed by the virus, calling it ""a little flu"" and saying that he would not be seriously affected by it. He has also urged regional governors to ease lockdowns, which he says hurt the economy, and on Monday he watered down regulations on wearing face masks. As of Monday, the number of deaths in Brazil was over 65,000 and infections were over 1.6m, second only to the United States. Read more here. The latestfigures from the Department of Health and Social care,externalhave been released, showing that a further 155 people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus. It makes the total number of deaths after a positive test in hospitals, care homes and the wider community 44,391. But it does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK. That figure is now thought to have passed 55,000. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there were 581 positive test results. A total of 286,349 cases have been confirmed in all. No 10 has rejected calls for Boris Johnson to apologise after he said""too many care homes didn't really follow procedures"" over coronavirus. Labour called the PM's comments ""crass"" and said government advice to care homes had been ""conflicting"".
And one union accused the PM of blaming care workers for government ""failings"". ButDowning Streetsaid Mr Johnson had been pointing out that not enough was known about the virus in the early stages of the outbreak.
The PM's official spokesman added that the care homes had ""done a brilliant job under very difficult circumstances"" and the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". Care homes were hit particularly badly by the coronaviruswith nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died of coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales since the outbreak. Israel has seen a surge in infections since it opened schools and businesses in May Israel's director of public health has resigned after the country experienced a sharp rise in cases. Siegal Sadetzki, an epidemiologist, criticised the government's response and said it had lifted lockdown restrictions too quickly. âThe achievements in dealing with the first wave [of infections] were cancelled out by the broad and swift opening of the economy,"" she wrote in a statement. Israel imposed a national lockdown in April, and by the following month it had reduced the number of new cases to about 20 a day. But it reopened schools and businesses shortly after and the rate of infection rose sharply. The daily number of new cases hit 1,000 last week. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country needed to take âlimited actionsâ to avoid another full lockdown. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 The Met has referred itself to the policing watchdog over the controversial stop-and-search of a British sprinter in west London. Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese 400m runner, were stopped in Maida Vale on Saturday. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Williams, 26, accused the Met of racially profiling her partner for driving a black Mercedes. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) will investigate. Footage of the stop and search has been shared widely on social media. In a statement the Met said the decision to refer to the IOPC had been taken ""due to the complaint being recorded and the significant public interest"". ""Two reviews of the circumstances by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards have not identified misconduct for any officer involved,"" the force added. This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted The Met had said officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. But Ms Williams believes she and her partner were targeted because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? ""They [the officers] said there's a lot of youth violence and stabbings in the area and that the car looked very suspicious,"" she said on Monday. ""They see a black male driving a nice car, an all-black car, and they assume that he was involved in some sort of gang, drug, violence problem."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the BBC he was ""pleased"" that the Met had referred the case as ""it's really important that Londoners have trust and confidence in the police and the way the police are policed"". ""There are concerns about the how the police behaved so it's right and proper that those concerns are looked into,"" he said. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said it had been supporting officers involved in the incident and called on the IOPC to ""conclude their work in a fair and timely fashion"". He added that ""a short clip of an incident widely shared on social media does not always tell the full operational policing story"". The police watchdog is alsoinvestigating a video of a white officer from Cambridgeshire Policequizzing a black driver which was shot in Ely in 2015 and was shared on Facebook in June as Black Lives Matter protests took place.

What guidance did care homes get? Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss Almost 30,000 more care home deaths than last year Care homes were hit particularly badly by the coronavirus with nearly20,000 people confirmed to have died of coronavirusin care homes in England and Wales since the outbreak. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people were ""insulted"" by Mr Johnson's ""crass remarks"". ""Care providers were sent conflicting guidance throughout this outbreak, staff could not access testing until mid-April and are still not tested routinely, PPE supplies have been inadequate, thousands of families have lost their loved ones in care homes to this disease, care workers themselves have died on the front line,"" he told MPs. He called on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to apologise for the PM's remarks. Mr Hancock said the prime minister had been ""explaining that because asymptomatic transmission was not known about, the correct procedures were therefore not known"". Regular tests for care home staff and residents are to be rolled out from next week He added: ""We've been constantly learning about this virus from the start and improving procedures all the way through and I pay tribute to the care homes in this country who have done so much to care for the most vulnerable throughout the crisis."" Speaking in the House of Lords another government minister, Lord Greenhalgh, admitted that guidance given to care homes during the initial stages of the pandemic was ""not as clear as it could have been"". Mark Adams, who runs the charity Community Integrated Care, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's comments were ""cowardly"" and a ""travesty of leadership"". And Unison, a trade union which represents workers providing public services, said: ""It's despicable for Boris Johnson to blame incredible, dedicated care workers for his own government's failings. ""Care staff have kept working throughout to help the vulnerable, putting their own health at risk with little or no protective kit and without testing. ""The prime minister should be ashamed, take responsibility and commit to proper, lasting reform of social care."" Behind the scenes in the government, there is a frustration the care sector has escaped largely blame free from the crisis. Care homes are not government-run. On the whole they are owned and operated by private firms. As you would expert in a network of more than 14,000 homes there is a variation in performances and practices. Not all care homes have seen outbreaks - and that, of course, means questions should be asked. But the sector is right to complain that guidance, certainly at the start, was changing all the time. The big national effort on PPE was focused on the NHS, leaving some homes severely lacking in equipment as their supply chains dried up or could not cope. The roll-out of testing was slow - it is only now that residents and staff are to get regular testing, vital if those who are infected but don't show symptoms are to be spotted. This virus is very tricky to contain and the UK is not alone in struggling to protect care homes. But no debate would be complete without mention of funding. The overhaul of the system has been talked about for years, but nothing has been done, leaving some services in a precarious position. The virus has certainly exploited that. On Sunday,NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens told the BBCthat plans to adequately fund the social care sector needed to be in place within a year. This video can not be played PM: ""Too many care homes didn't follow procedures"" Asked on Monday about his remarks, Mr Johnson said: ""One of the things the crisis has shown is we need to think about how we organise our social care package better and how we make sure we look after people better who are in social care. ""We discovered too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures in the way that they could have but we're learning lessons the whole time."" During the 2019 election, the Conservatives promised an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. The government has given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. It has also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. Almost 30,000 more care home deaths than last year What did the government do about Covid and care homes?

"Circus performers have delivered a letter to Downing Street calling for inclusion in the recent arts rescue package or to be allowed to reopen. The letter warns that their industry faces collapse in two weeks without government support. More than 50 acts including clowns, acrobats and dancers from some of the UK's top circuses joined the rally. Circuses, like all venues, had to pause production of shows back in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday the government announced a Â£1.57bn support package for arts venues struggling with the negative financial impact of the shutdown. The bailout included theatres, galleries, museums and music venues and artists, but the Association of Circus Proprietors (ACP) says no provision was made for circuses. Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package It followed an earlierArts Council England announcement of a Â£160m cash injectionto help artists, venues and freelancers in the cultural sector but not all institutions qualified, including London's Globe Theatre. More than 30 circuses were active in the UK at the beginning of lockdown The letter from the ACP is supported by 18 member circuses from around the UK representing more than 500 circus professionals. ACP chairman Martin Burton said: ""Sadly, circuses seem to have fallen through the cracks of all the rescue package schemes - we pay rent to individual landowners as we tour - and do not have business rateable properties. ""In addition, no commercial circuses have qualified for the any of the Â£160m emergency Arts Council funding despite generating significant income to the economy through the 30-plus UK circuses and internationally visiting shows such as Cirque du Soleil which combined are seen by around 20 million people a year. ""Its greatest slogan 'The Show Must Go On' could well become a thing of the past if urgent assistance is not forthcoming."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: ""We have announced a major Â£1.57 billion package to support the cultural and creative sectors as we take steps towards audiences returning to live performances. ""We have developed a five-stage roadmap which provides a clear pathway back for the sector. The next stage of the roadmap will be performances outdoors with social distancing and pilots for indoor events with social distancing. We are working closely with the sector and medical experts on our phased approach."" Cirque du Soleil is set to shed up to 95% of its staff Performers representing circuses including Giffords Circus, Zippos Circus, Cirque Berserk and Circus of Horrors were among those on the march to Downing Street. Last month, Canadian entertainment firmCirque du Soleil said is was set to cut 3,500 jobsafter striking a deal to avoid bankruptcy. The group, best known for its flamboyant touring circuses, said the coronavirus pandemic had forced it to cancel shows, including six in Las Vegas, and lay off its artists. The company is now trying to restructure while shedding about 95% of its staff. ""With zero revenue since the forced closure of all of our shows due to Covid-19, the management had to act decisively,"" said boss Daniel Lamarre. Again, the firm had to pause production of all of its shows in March. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Hundreds of thousands of homeowners will receive vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements, with the poorest getting up to Â£10,000. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out a Â£2bn grant scheme in England for projects such as insulation as part of a wider Â£3bn plan to cut emissions. The Treasury said the grants could help to support more than 100,000 jobs. Labour said renters appeared to be left out and called for a ""broader and bigger"" plan to cut carbon emissions. It comes ahead of a summer statement from Mr Sunak on Wednesday, in which he could announce changes to stamp duty and VAT. Business leaders and a former chancellor have called for radical action to bolster the economy, which is still reeling from the impact of coronavirus. Under the Green Homes Grant, the government will pay at least two-thirds of the cost of home improvements that save energy, the Treasury said. For example, a homeowner of a semi-detached or end-of-terrace house could install cavity wall and floor insulation for about Â£4,000 - the homeowner would pay Â£1,320 while the government would contribute Â£2,680. Coronavirus: UK warned to avoid climate change crisis Coronavirus: Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Coronavirus recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' The scheme will launch in September, with online applications for recommended energy efficiency measures, along with details of accredited local suppliers. Once one of these suppliers has provided a quote and the work is approved, the voucher is issued. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Business Secretary Alok Sharma added that the poorest households could receive up to Â£10,000 towards costs, and that double glazing would also be covered by the scheme. He continued: ""What [the scheme] ultimately means is lower bills for households, hundreds of pounds off energy bills every year, it's supporting jobs and is very good news for the environment."" The chancellor is rumoured to be planning changes to stamp duty to help the housing market The government said about half of the fund - which is due to be spent in one financial year - will go to the poorest homeowners, who will not have to contribute anything to the cost. Better insulation could save some people Â£600 a year on energy bills, the Treasury said. Mr Sunak said the investment would also help to ""kick-start our economy"" by creating thousands of jobs and providing business for existing skilled workers, as the UK recovers from the economic shock of coronavirus. ""As Britain recovers from the outbreak, it's vital we do everything in our power to support and protect livelihoods across the nation,"" he said. The governmentwill pledge to provide 30,000 new traineeshipsto get young people in England into work, giving firms Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer According to reports, there could be a short-term VAT cut for the ailing hospitality industry to help lift demand However, the Observer reported that plans to give all adults Â£500 and children Â£250 in vouchers to spend on hospitality were being considered as an alternative The chancellor is also likely to announce a stamp duty holiday, reportedly aimed at first time buyers. The grants are part of a wider Â£3bn ""green investment"" package due to be announced in the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday, to support efforts to rebuild the economy after the pandemic. The plan aims to create tens of thousands of new jobs while helping the UK meet its 2050 target of achieving net zero carbon emissions. It will involve improving insulation in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and retro-fitting low-carbon heating technology to social housing. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The Conservative manifesto had pledged Â£9.2bn for improving the energy efficiency of low income housing and public buildings. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband welcomed the plan but stressed that it was not ""comprehensive"". ""It appears there is almost nothing for the people who rent the 8.5 million homes in the social rented sector and private rented sector, which has the worst energy efficiency standards. That means one-third of people are left out,"" he said. The Treasury says the Â£3bn investment plan will cut energy bills by an average of Â£200 for some of the UK's poorest households Mr Miliband said the government needed ""a much broader and bigger-scale strategy"" to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, including investing in nature conservation, increasing renewable energy, supporting manufacturers to be greener and improving transport. Meanwhile, Rosie Rogers, senior political advisor at Greenpeace UK, said the UK still wasn't ""playing in the same league"" as other countries, such as Germany, which is investing â¬40bn (Â£36bn) in green jobs and energy efficiency, or France, which pledged â¬15bn to tackle the climate crisis in June. The UK Treasury said the figures are not like-for-like. Ahead of Wednesday's summer statement, former Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Sunak faced an extraordinarily complex challenge in reviving the economy. He said Mr Sunak would need to support viable businesses affected by shutdowns, but also help ""a transition"" for businesses that are no longer economically viable. ""Some businesses will close, some viable businesses will close units,"" he said. Mr Hammond added that ""the other great unknown"" is that ""we don't know what the trajectory of the disease itself is going to be"". He said the economy was likely to start to bounce back quickly as restrictions are lifted, but that would tail off, and some parts of the economy such as hospitality, aviation, and entertainment could take years to recover. Meanwhile Alison Brittain, chief executive of Premier Inn owner Whitbread, said it would be ""enormously helpful"" if Mr Sunak took action to support the hospitality sector on Wednesday. ""Anything about VAT relief for guests and customers would be great,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""Anything on rates relief, still, because the business rates holiday was enormously important for the sector and if we could extend that a bit longer, that would be equally helpful to us.""

Until then, stay safe. Care home providers have criticised Boris Johnson after he said""too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures in the way that they could have""during the coronavirus pandemic. At least 20,000 care home residents in England and Waleshave died from Covid-19since the start of the outbreak. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, described the prime minister's comments as ""neither accurate nor welcome"" and said government guidance to the sector had come ""in stops and starts, with organisations grappling with over 100 pieces of additional guidance"". Most of the estimated 14,000 care homes in England are privately run, but they are regulated by national bodies and would typically act on advice from central as well as local government. Police closed a bar on Saturday after finding that no social distancing was taking place and the owner was ""intoxicated and argumentative"". Durham Police officers temporarily closed the Number One Bar in Darlington when officers decided staff were not in control of how customers were behaving. The force also temporarily closed the Wheatsheaf pub in Chilton, County Durham, blaming ""irresponsible behaviour"" at the two venues.

Boddell's in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, shut its doors at 21:00 BST on Saturday after learning there were ""a number of people around the town centre who had been drinking all day"". Bosses said the decision was a ""proactive rather than reactive measure"" and no customers were asked to leave for not following rules. In a poston the venue's Facebook page,external, they said: ""Understanding that it will take some time for people to become fully accustomed to the 'new normal' of pubs, especially after a few drinks, we have subsequently taken the decision to close earlier on weekends for the time being.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the prime minister was ""certainly not blaming care homes"" for social care coronavirus deaths in comments made on Monday. Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying""too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures""during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sharma said: ""Specifically on the point the prime minister was making yesterday, I think what he was actually pointing out is that nobody knew what the correct procedures were at the time because, quite frankly, we didn't know what the extent of asymptomatic transmission was. ""We then put in place very detailed action plans for care homes, we made sure there was a rigorous testing regime put in place, and we also ensured there was extra money - there was Â£600m that went in as part of an infection control fund.""

It said bike sales had risen 57.1%in the 13 weeks to 3 July as people sought to avoid public transport. As a retailer selling goods considered essential, Halfords did not have to cease trading because of coronavirus. However, a big fall in motoring revenues meant that quarterly same-store sales declined 6.5% overall.

"Circus performers have delivered a letter to Downing Street calling for inclusion in the recent arts rescue package or to be allowed to reopen. The letter warns that their industry faces collapse in two weeks without government support. More than 50 acts including clowns, acrobats and dancers from some of the UK's top circuses joined the rally. Circuses, like all venues, had to pause production of shows back in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday the government announced a Â£1.57bn support package for arts venues struggling with the negative financial impact of the shutdown. The bailout included theatres, galleries, museums and music venues and artists, but the Association of Circus Proprietors (ACP) says no provision was made for circuses. Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package It followed an earlierArts Council England announcement of a Â£160m cash injectionto help artists, venues and freelancers in the cultural sector but not all institutions qualified, including London's Globe Theatre. More than 30 circuses were active in the UK at the beginning of lockdown The letter from the ACP is supported by 18 member circuses from around the UK representing more than 500 circus professionals. ACP chairman Martin Burton said: ""Sadly, circuses seem to have fallen through the cracks of all the rescue package schemes - we pay rent to individual landowners as we tour - and do not have business rateable properties. ""In addition, no commercial circuses have qualified for the any of the Â£160m emergency Arts Council funding despite generating significant income to the economy through the 30-plus UK circuses and internationally visiting shows such as Cirque du Soleil which combined are seen by around 20 million people a year. ""Its greatest slogan 'The Show Must Go On' could well become a thing of the past if urgent assistance is not forthcoming."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: ""We have announced a major Â£1.57 billion package to support the cultural and creative sectors as we take steps towards audiences returning to live performances. ""We have developed a five-stage roadmap which provides a clear pathway back for the sector. The next stage of the roadmap will be performances outdoors with social distancing and pilots for indoor events with social distancing. We are working closely with the sector and medical experts on our phased approach."" Cirque du Soleil is set to shed up to 95% of its staff Performers representing circuses including Giffords Circus, Zippos Circus, Cirque Berserk and Circus of Horrors were among those on the march to Downing Street. Last month, Canadian entertainment firmCirque du Soleil said is was set to cut 3,500 jobsafter striking a deal to avoid bankruptcy. The group, best known for its flamboyant touring circuses, said the coronavirus pandemic had forced it to cancel shows, including six in Las Vegas, and lay off its artists. The company is now trying to restructure while shedding about 95% of its staff.

" Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 In a small room, in a village on the outskirts of Wuhan, an elderly woman is chanting quietly and tapping out time on a table. Opposite her, another woman is crying softly. In early February, her 44-year-old brother died from coronavirus, and she cannot forgive herself. After the ceremony, Ms Wang - she doesn't want to use her full name - says that the shaman received a message from beyond the grave. Her brother, Wang Fei, had absolved her of any blame. “Feifei doesn't hold me responsible,” she says, referring to him by the name the family has used since childhood. “He was trying to comfort me and persuade me to accept his death.” Her brother died on a Covid ward, unable to see visitors; his last days lived out in a series of desperate text messages. “I feel so tired,” he wrote in one of them. “This disease has dragged on for too long.” Ms Wang’s guilt is a product of one of the cruellest aspects of this global pandemic – the enforced isolation of sufferers from their families. “I couldn’t go to the hospital to take care of him,” she tells me. “When I heard he’d died, I just couldn’t accept it. My family’s been broken into pieces.” She wants answers about her brother’s treatment - whether he was given proper care, and whether more could have been done to save him. But Ms Wang has been told by the police not to speak to the foreign media, and her choice to ignore that warning carries some risk. Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother One woman we arrange to interview arrives with plain-clothes policemen in pursuit. When she scrambles into our car, they block our way. We meet another man in the darkness on the banks of Wuhan’s East Lake. He tells us he’s been visited twice by the police for speaking out about the death of his father. For victims and journalists alike, asking questions about how and why the outbreak began in Wuhan, and whether it might have been better contained, is not easy. But at the epicentre of this global disaster, the need to ask questions is a necessity, not a choice. The day in mid-January when Wang Fei began to feel unwell, China's official death toll stood at just three. Today, more than 11 million people have been infected worldwide,at least 500,000 have died-  and the virus has forced the lockdown of entire economies. It is here where the virus was first discovered and the first attempts made to contain it. And it is here, too, where the search for its origin must begin, leading to perhaps the biggest question of them all, and one now at the heart of an escalating propaganda war between Washington and Beijing. Did the coronavirus  – as most scientists think – come from nature, or might it have leaked from a lab?  Ms Wang says her brother, who worked as a driver, hardly ever left Wuhan. Over the course of his 44 years, the central Chinese city grew from a declining industrial backwater into a booming international business and transport hub. But if Wang Fei’s life coincided with Wuhan’s extraordinary revival, then his final days ran in parallel with its descent into disaster. In early January, medics had begun to realise that the disease was highly infectious and wereimplementing their own hospital quarantine procedures. But instead of alerting the public, the authorities were silencing health workers. Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn colleagues to take precautions against infection, was reprimanded and made tosign a confession by the police. On the weekend of 18 January, with the authorities still insisting thedisease was not contagious, Wang Fei began to feel unwell. He went to hospital where he was given paracetamol for his fever and sent home. “They say there’s no human-to-human transmission, but the doctors are all wearing masks,” he told his sister. She can repeat the exact wording of the official reassurances, even now. “At that time, I was telling him that it is 'controllable and preventable,'” she says. “Only when I look back, I realise the government really didn't give enough warning. Now I know what he really needed was proper medical help. That’s what makes me feel guilty.” Mr Wang cancelled the family’s plans to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, which fell the following weekend. Instead he spent his days joining long queues outside hospitals. But with too many patients and not enough beds, he would return home exhausted. “He believed deeply that the country and government loved him,” Ms Wang says, “and that they would protect him.” On 23 January, Wuhan was put into lockdown. It was the world’s first, and became one of the longest and strictest attempts to contain the spread of the virus. But it came too late to prevent an estimated five million people leaving the city in the run-up to the national holiday. A few days later, his condition deteriorated and the family called for an ambulance. They were told there were more than 600 people ahead of them in the queue. Seven hours later he was finally admitted to hospital. Mr Wang found himself in a health system that was now totally overwhelmed. He texted his sister, complaining about the difficulty of getting staff to attend to his basic needs - such as help with drinking water. He continued to get worse. On 7 February Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor censored by the police, died in the same hospital. Mr Wang's spirits sank even lower. “If even a doctor can't survive,” he told his sister by text, “what chance have I got?” They are still silencing medics in Wuhan. Outside one hospital, we speak to a nurse who tells us about her experience on the front lines dealing with Covid-19 patients. Afterwards we exchange contact details and she cycles away. Two plain-clothes policemen, who have been watching us, emerge from the side of the street. They run alongside her with their hands on her handlebars, and bring her bike to a halt. I can see them speaking sternly to her, but by the time I catch up with them, they’ve let her go. She calls a few minutes later and asks us to delete the interview. For her safety we have no choice but to agree. The control of information, of course, has long been central to China’s system of government. In this case, it is central to the story. Wuhan’s lockdown was successful in eventually bringing the city’s outbreak under control, but China faces allegations,including from the US government, that delay and cover-up in the early stages made a global crisis inevitable. In the early stages of any disease outbreak, even days can make a big difference to the speed and scale of the spread. One studyhas suggested that if it had acted a week earlier, the number of cases in China could have been reduced by 66%. The authoritiesdeny the allegations. They insist that, in the face of a previously unknown disease, their response was swift and point out that it has been commended by theWorld Health Organization. The government is now comparing itself favourably to administrations in the West, even overtly mocking them for what it sees asa chaotic and confused response. And it is silencing those who mightchallenge that narrative. While the failings of democratic governments have been comprehensively exposed by a free press, there is no such scrutiny in China. This is a place where even trying to talk openly about your dead brother can bring you to the attention of the police. We put in requests to interview parliamentary delegates, senior health officials, academics and doctors - more than 20 people. None of our requests were granted. We sent questions to China’s health commission and its foreign and science ministries about the release of public information in the early days of the crisis. They went unanswered too. Wang Fei lived a short walk from a large market that became an early focus of the unfolding story. Despite its name, the Huanan Seafood Market is known to have had some trade in wild mammalssold there as delicacies. It is now closed. Initially, it was suspected to be ground zero for the outbreak, the place where the virusmade the leap from animals to humans. Sars-CoV-2 – as it has now been named - belongs to a family of coronaviruses named for their spikey or crown-like surfaces. A vast number of these viruses have been shown to becarried by bats. Some of them are thought to have the potential to infect humans, either when passeddirectly from a bat, or after first infecting another animal species – an intermediate host – that then comes intocontact with people. This is,one theory suggests, what triggered another coronavirus outbreak in China which first appeared in November 2002. The Sars coronavirus, now known as Sars CoV-1, is thought to have jumped from bats to humans via the civet cat - a small furry mammal sold in the markets of southern China. After the authorities failed to acknowledge the outbreak for several months, Sars went on to cause 774 deaths worldwide. Nearly two decades later, the very first cluster of Sars CoV-2 cases appeared in Mr Wang’s Wuhan neighbourhood. One study foundaround half of themhad a connection to the seafood market. It was no surprise then that there was widespread speculation the virus’s intermediate host might have been among theanimals on sale there. But this theory now appears to have beendismissed by China, following the testing of samples taken from various places inside the market. While traces of the virus were found, none were detected on any of the animal samples. Officials have concluded that the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. Most scientists remain convinced, though, that somewhere along the line, whether in a market or elsewhere, Sars-CoV-2 will have passed naturally froman animal to a human. They point to an increasing number ofsuch “spillover” eventsdriven by factors such as population growth and human encroachmenton natural habitats. Dr Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from Hong Kong University who joined the Chinese National Health Commission fact-finding trip to Wuhan in January, says the “spillover” theory is the most favoured for the origin of this virus. This is not least, he says, because such events have happened so often before, from Sars CoV-1 to other avian-flu pandemics. “H5N1 was the first wake-up, then Sars, then H7N9 in the Yangtze Delta, and now Sars-CoV-2,” he tells me. “So, if you ask me what is the highest possibility – it’s that the virus is coming out from markets, markets that are selling wildlife.” And that’s why, he argues, the trade in wild animals should remain the focus of prevention efforts. “It is not easy to change culture, but we must,” he says. Finding the source of the virus is not just a question of academic interest. If Sars-CoV-2 has come from a reservoir of infection in a particular animal species, then of course, it could continue to pose the risk of new outbreaks. In mid-May, the World Health Organization passed a resolution calling for an international effort to trace the likely intermediate animal host. It has just announced it has been given permission to send ateam of investigators to China for this purpose. But scientists agree it maynot be an easy task. We sent a number of questions to the Chinese National Health Commission and the foreign and science ministries about the work already being done in this regard. We asked if any studies had begun to test various animal species that could have spread the virus. We received no answers to our questions. Outside the shuttered Huanan Seafood Market we’re stopped from filming. “I don’t care where you’re from,” a policeman tells me when I explain that I’m a foreign journalist. “China has done a lot to contain the virus. You need to promote positive energy.” As Wang Fei lay dying in hospital, another location in Wuhan, a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood Market, was already becoming the focus of an altogether different theory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was now at the centre of a growing storm of conspiracy theories, suspicions and allegations that the virus might have leaked from a lab. They have continued to this day. The WIV’s modernist, grey concrete and glass structure, set in a leafy campus with a small lake, is clearly visible from the adjacent road. When we arrive there, we are quickly surrounded by security guards who tell us it’s a sensitive area and call the police. The institute is the world’s leading authority in the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. Its researchers are led by star scientist Professor Shi Zhengli – known as “Bat Woman” to her colleagues because of her expertise. They have spent years collecting samples from live bats in remote Chinese caves. Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab One recent paper, co-authored by Professor Shi, gives details about hundreds of bat coronaviruses, many of them previously unpublished, unveiling justhow many have been gathered. The research has included the genetic modification of some of these viruses, including the construction of new, chimeric – or hybrid – viruses, in order to examine their potential to infect humans and, potentially, cause pandemics. It was Professor Shi who discovered and sequenced the genetic code of the nearest known relative of theSars CoV-1 virus, found inside a bat from a cave in China's Yunnan Province. Ever since the Sars CoV-1 outbreak, the fear of an even deadlier, more infectious spillover event has been the driving force behind Wuhan's coronavirus research. On 2 January, just three days after becoming aware of the new virus circulating in Wuhan, she also became the first tosequence Sars-Cov-2. Ironically, it is the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 that has itself helped fuel the lab-leak theory. Some subsequent studies, includingone by Prof Shi, suggest that there is something different about its genome compared to other known coronaviruses of a similar type. Its spike proteins – the pointy bits of the “crown” that latch onto the cells of an infected host – seem to bind extremely well to human cells. While most viruses need time to adapt to a new host, Sars-CoV-2 appears to have been highly infectious from the beginning of the outbreak. One papercompared the new outbreak with the original Sars epidemic. It found that Sars-CoV-2 was already “pre-adapted” for human infection. The virus’ spike proteins also have a feature, unusual in Sars-type coronaviruses, known as a “furin cleavage site”. These arethought likelyto increase the efficiency with which the virus can penetrate the human cells, take them over and replicate inside them. It is this combination of factors – the WIV’s proximity to the outbreak, the kind of scientific work it was involved in, and the seemingly unusual nature of the virus itself – that have led to the highly controversial alternative to the natural “spillover” theory. Claims that the virus leaked from a lab first began to circulate on the Chinese internet in early February. There were unsubstantiated rumours the coronavirus may have passed from a lab-infected animal tothe local community, or that one of the WIV researchers may have themselvesbecome accidentally infected,  either with a natural virus collected from the wild, or a lab-made one. Conspiracy theories soon spread further afield, including claims in some foreign newspapers and websites that the virus may have beenan engineered “bio-weapon”. But none of the lab leak theories – animal virus, man-made virus, deliberate or accidental – have been backed up with any concrete proof, relying instead on conjecture and circumstantial evidence. A group of Indian researchers were some of the first to use the virus’ genome to hint at the possibility ofgenetic modification in a lab. But the paper was quicklydebunked and was withdrawn. However unusual the virus appeared to be, there was nothing to prove that its notable features could not have come directly from nature. In early February, Shi Zhengli herself took to social media in response. “I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote, adding that those who spread rumours should“shut their stinking mouths”. Meanwhile, Mr Wang was succumbing to some of the same notable qualities of the virus on which such theories were partly based. It was a pattern of decline now all too familiar to medics everywhere. His lungs were being ravaged by the pathogen, filling with fluid and white blood cells, and the oxygen in his blood was plummeting. “My heartbeat rate is 160 per min. My blood oxygen saturation is only 70. It’s killing me,” he texted his sister. The following day, on 8 February, he sent one last message. “Please save me,” it read, “I can see stars.” He died a few hours later.  On 30 April, the US president waded into the controversy. He was asked by a reporter: “Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?” “Yes, I have. Yes, I have,”Donald Trump replied. Other administration officials have weighed in, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming what he claimed was China’s“history of running sub-standard laboratories”. But despite the US saying to have “enormous evidence” for a lab leak, none has been provided. With the theory now central to an escalating geopolitical dispute between the US and China, critics of President Trump’s handling of the response at home see it as a sensationalist smokescreen todeflect domestic blame. Mindful that they could be drawn into a quagmire of conspiracy and propaganda, some scientists, however, believe that the lab leak question should not be dismissed out-of-hand. It relates, they say, to one of the major scientific debates of our time and it has implications not just for China but for the US government too. The work of the WIV, in collecting large numbers of bat coronaviruses and experimenting on them, has not been a lone venture. It has been part of a majorinternational effortfocused on the growing risk of spillover events and the threat of new, human pandemics. Some of Wuhan’s research has involved collaborations withUS scientistsand the backing of generous amounts ofUS funding. And its creation of chimeric viruses - the stitching together of parts of the genomes of different viruses to make new ones - uses an easily accessible technique commonplace in labs around the world. Such research has  been the subject of an intense disagreement between scientists about the benefits andrisks of such research. Supporters say it can help us to anticipate how viruses might emerge in the wild and has the potential to help with the development of medicines and vaccines. Those against, say it risks doing the exact opposite. Manipulating viruses – to make them more infectious or more deadly – could, they say, spark off a man-made pandemic with a lab-made virus. The risks might include lab workers becoming infected – perhaps unknowingly – when collecting virus samples from animals in the field, when handling animals kept in the lab, or when experimenting with live viruses. Since the Sars CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, for example, there have been four separate leaks from labs studying that disease. Two of the incidents were at the National Institute of Virology inBeijing in 2004. During one of them, a researcher caught Sars after spending two weeks at the lab. She went on to infect her mother, who died, as well as a nurse, who in turn infected several other people. The coincidence of a new pandemic coronavirus appearing in the same city as a laboratory devoted to studying them is something that Prof Shi Zhengli appeared to initially acknowledge. When she learned of the outbreak at the end of December, her thoughts turned to the viruses stored in the institute's freezers. In an interview with Scientific American, she says she remembers thinking that if coronaviruses had sparked the pandemic:“Could they have come from our lab?” While the lab leak theory has smouldered away both online and in Washington political circles, it has largely beendismissed by scientists. It is a scientific consensus that has, in turn, fed into mainstream media coverage, with now wide acceptance that a natural, spillover event is the most probablecause of Sars-CoV-2. The dismissal is based not just on the fact that such spillovers have happened before, but on a key piece of evidence that has come from Prof Shi Zhengli herself. Concerned to rule out her lab’s involvement in the outbreak, according to the Scientific American interview, she began “frantically” searching the experimental records and samples already stored in her lab. HerFebruary paperreported what she said was the closest match she was able to find. A virus, which she named RaTG13, collected from a bat in 2013, showed a 96.2% similarity to Sars-CoV-2. Although that sounds close, the 3.8% genetic difference between the two would, estimates suggest, take decades of evolutionary change tooccur in nature. If Sars-CoV-2 had leaked from her collection of coronaviruses, the lab would have contained either Sars-CoV-2 itself, or something much, much closer related. “That really took a load off my mind,” Prof Shi told Scientific American. “I had not slept a wink for days.” But the evidence that has undoubtedly had the most bearing on the discussion about a possible lab leak was contained in a paper published in March in the medical journal,Nature Medicine. It has become widely accepted as proof that the virus was not made in a lab. The unusual features of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein discussed earlier – its high binding affinity to human cells and its furin cleavage site – must have, the authors argue, come from nature. Their evidence is partly based on the use of sophisticated computer modelling. If a scientist had used such models in advance, they argue, to analyse how strongly the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein might bind to human cells, the results would predict a far weaker bond than actually turns out to be the case. In other words, a computer would be unable to foresee the binding strength of the virus. Therefore, they argue, no scientist is likely to have set out to create it in a lab. Furthermore, they imply, to create Sars-CoV-2 in a lab, you’d need to start with a virus with a much closer genetic match than RaTG13, the distant ancestor found in the Wuhan freezer. A new virus cannot be made from a virus that does not exist. Far more likely, they say, that the virus picked up its notable features while circulating, undetected, in humans or animals for months or years before the outbreak. “We very carefully considered a potential link to the lab - we did not dismiss this possibility out of hand,” the paper’s lead author Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US tells me. “And it is clear - all the available data is fully consistent with a natural history of Sars-CoV-2. There is no scientific data showing any link to the lab. “Most theories considering a link to the lab are conspiracy theories,” he adds. “They are exceptionally disruptive to the efforts of getting Covid-19 under control and result in unnecessary human suffering.” Despite the wide acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Nature Medicine Paper, there are stillsome scientistswho refuse to see it as conclusive proof that the virus wasn’t manipulated in some way. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide and Chairman and Research Director of Vaxine, a company leading Australia's search for a Covid-19 vaccine, believes that laboratory manipulation has to remain under consideration for being behind a possible explanation for Sars-CoV-2’s“surprising”ability to bind to human cells. And he rejects the argument that if it wasn’t pre-planned by a computer model, it didn’t happen. “In science a lot of things are done on the basis of give-it-a-go, and a lot of things happen completely by accident,” he tells me. “You know, a lot of Nobel prizes have been won on the basis of accidents.” Others referto Wuhan’spast experimentsin which genome segments from different viruses have been stitched together to investigate how spike proteins bind to human cells. And they point out that there is no way of knowing whether or not Wuhan does in fact have, among the hundreds of coronaviruses it has collected, anything closer in genetic make-up to Sars-CoV-2 than RaTG13. What’s more, RaTG13 is itself the subject of some speculation. The BBC has had it confirmed, from the researchers running a respectedChinese database, that it is the same virus as one that the WIV previously referred to as RaBatCov/4991inthis paper. There is no explanation for the change of name, but that 2016 paper makes it clear that the virus appears to be a new strain of Sars-type coronavirus. Professor Petrovsky says it would be odd if the WIV, given its interest in such viruses, hadn’t continued to work on it. But there is no more mention of it at all until this year, when RaBatCov/4991 re-emerged under its new name RaTG13 as the closest known relative of Sars-CoV-2. Professor Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University in the US, says there is only one way to conclusively rule out any form of a lab leak. “A credible investigation would need unrestricted access by investigators to facilities, samples, records, and personnel, as well as unrestricted environmental sampling of facilities and serological sampling of personnel,” he tells me. The US government said in a statement in April that the intelligence community does not believe the virus was modified or created, but the government continues “to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of anaccident at a laboratory in Wuhan”. We put in a request to speak to Professor Shi Zhengli but it was turned down. We sent questions to the WIV asking whether any investigation had been carried out and, if not, whether they’d be willing to allow one. Again, there was no response. Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days. Afraid that she might be infected, Ms Wang was too worried to join her mother at home, so stuck it out in the office, surviving on simple meals. She was joined by her brother’s 13-year-old daughter, while his widow, also infected with coronavirus, recovered in hospital. “I kept writing down memories of my brother,” Ms Wang tells me, “and then posted them on social media in order to ease my empty feelings and hopelessness.” After the lockdown was lifted on 8 April she emerged into a city that had, through an extraordinary collective effort and the forced ordeal of lockdown, vanquished the virus. Today, Wuhan is returning to life. But the signs of the lingering economic impact can still be seen. In one of the usually vibrant night-markets people are eating and socialising again, but many of the tables are empty. “Customer numbers are down by two-thirds,” one woman selling boiled frogs tells me. There are signs of something else here too. Early in the lockdown, in the chaos and confusion of that moment, the censorship controls appeared to briefly vanish. People vented their anger on social media about the perceived official failings, and their grief, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang. Today though, a different narrative has taken hold. “China united together to prevent the epidemic,” says another trader, selling yellow-croaker fish on sticks. “But you foreigners don’t know how to protect yourselves.” And the market customers appear to have absorbed yet another origin theory which has been promoted by Chinese state media andsome senior officials. “I think the virus came from the US,” one woman tells me. “In the early stage of the outbreak, US soldiers were visiting Wuhan. They left early in a chartered plane.” In the absence of independent evidence, politics and propaganda are filling the vacuum with both the US and China continuing to trade unsubstantiated allegations. And without it, it is impossible to answer the big questions. How might a spillover event be better contained next time? And how do we properly balance the benefits of the study of pandemic viruses, in a growing number ofvirology labs, against the risks? Scientists who support such work are convinced that Sars-CoV-2 is an incentive to redouble their efforts. “The mission must go on,” Professor Shi Zhengli says, with a plan to sample bat viruses on a much bigger scale. Something Professor Richard Ebright, from Rutgers, calls the“definition of insanity”. China has, under some diplomatic pressure, agreed to anindependent investigationinto the international response to the virus, although it is unclear what the remit will be, who will take part, and when it might happen. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it will have to wait until thepandemic is over. Meanwhile Ms Wang says she intends to continue to fight for answers about her brother’s death. She insists the warnings from the police to keep quiet won’t stop her. “I’m a law abiding citizen,” she says. She does not want us to publish her full name simply to minimise the risk of online abuse, not because she is trying to hide from the authorities. Sometimes it is in the individual stories that the true, global impact of the virus really hits home. Four months after Wang Fei died, Ms Wang has only just told her mother what really happened. The family, fearing she would be unable to bear the news, allowed her to believe her son was still in quarantine. In the end, they could hide it no longer. “For several days my mum couldn’t fall asleep,” Ms Wang tells me. “A woman born before the founding of our country can’t understand why such a tragedy can happen in modern times.”   ",Positive,0.9998634
"This video can not be played PM: ""Too many care homes didn't follow procedures"" Boris Johnson has been accused of trying to shift the blame for coronavirus deaths onto care homes. The prime minister said on Monday that ""too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures"". His words sparked fury in the care home sector, with one charity boss calling them ""clumsy and cowardly"". Health secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had done ""amazing work"" during the crisis and rejected Labour calls to apologise for the PM's remark. ""The PM was explaining that because asymptomatic transmission was not known about, the correct procedures were therefore not known,"" Mr Hancock said in the House of Commons. He said the government had been been ""constantly learning about this virus from the start and improving procedures all the way through"". Appearing in the House of Lords, Communities Minister Lord Greenhalgh admitted that the guidance given to care homes during the early stages of the pandemic was ""not as clear as it could have been"". What guidance did care homes get? Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss When did care homes go into lockdown? And a No 10 spokesman said the PM would not be apologising for his remarks, and said the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". But Mark Adams, who runs the charity Community Integrated Care, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's comments were ""cowardly"" and a ""travesty of leadership"". He added: ""If this is genuinely his view, I think we're almost entering a Kafkaesque alternative reality where the government sets the rules, we follow them, they don't like the results, they then deny setting the rules and blame the people that were trying to do their best."" Nearly20,000 people are confirmed to have died of coronavirusin care homes in England and Wales since the beginning of the outbreak. The National Care Forum said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""frankly hugely insulting"" to care workers. Vic Rayner, executive director of the forum which represents 120 social care charities, told BBC Newsnight that care homes followed the guidance ""to the letter"" but the government's attention was focused on hospitals. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to apologise for the prime minister's ""crass remarks"". ""Care providers were sent conflicting guidance throughout this outbreak, staff could not access testing until mid-April and are still not tested routinely, PPE supplies have been inadequate, thousands of families have lost their loved ones in care homes to this disease, care workers themselves have died on the front line,"" he said during an urgent question to Mr Hancock in the Commons. ""Can he understand why people are so insulted by the PM's remarks when he said too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures?"" Behind the scenes in the government, there is a frustration the care sector has escaped largely blame free from the crisis. Care homes are not government-run. On the whole they are owned and operated by private firms. As you would expert in a network of more than 14,000 homes there is a variation in performances and practices. Not all care homes have seen outbreaks - and that, of course, means questions should be asked. But the sector is right to complain that guidance, certainly at the start, was changing all the time. The big national effort on PPE was focused on the NHS, leaving some homes severely lacking in equipment as their supply chains dried up or could not cope. The roll-out of testing was slow - it is only now that residents and staff are to get regular testing, vital if those who are infected but don't show symptoms are to be spotted. This virus is very tricky to contain and the UK is not alone in struggling to protect care homes. But no debate would be complete without mention of funding. The overhaul of the system has been talked about for years, but nothing has been done, leaving some services in a precarious position. The virus has certainly exploited that. It comes as the Care England, the largest body representing independent care homes, accused the government of dragging its feet over issuing new guidance for visitors to care homes. Chief executive Martin Green said: ""We are at a loss to know why the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is incapable of making swift decisions at a time of crisis. ""As the country unlocks, care providers are in the dark as to what is permissible in terms of visitors to their residents, or indeed residents leaving their homes on visits. ""This should have been a priority for the DHSC given that care homes are central to fighting this dreadful pandemic"". Imelda Redmond - the national director of Healthwatch England which champions health and social care users - told BBC Radio 4 that ""the issues that underlie all of this have been there for a long time"". ""There has been underinvestment in social care for many years - and there needs to be quite significant amounts of reform - all those fault lines have been laid bare in this pandemic. ""We need to get a grip to this before we enter winter and perhaps a second wave."" NHS England head Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sundaythat coronavirus had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. Asked on Monday about Sir Simon's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""One of the things the crisis has shown is we need to think about how we organise our social care package better and how we make sure we look after people better who are in social care. ""We discovered too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures in the way that they could have but we're learning lessons the whole time."" Ahead of December's election, the Conservatives pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. The government has given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. How do you think care homes have handled the coronavirus crisis?

"The Royal Society says the UK lags behind in setting clear policies on face coverings and on using them The Welsh Government is ""continuing to look"" at evidence on whether face coverings should be mandatory in public places, the health minister has said. The head of the UK's national academy of science said everyone should wear a face covering in crowded public spaces. People in Wales are advised, but not required, to wear face coverings if social distancing is not possible. Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government was ""actively considering what is the right thing to do"". He said he would look at evidence from the scientific advisory group SAGE and consult Wales' Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton about whether to change guidance. Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Who needs to wear a face covering in the UK? Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask Royal Society PresidentProf Sir Venki Ramakrishnansaid the UK was ""way behind"" many countries in their usage and there was evidence that they protected both the wearer and those around them. The Welsh Government has recommended in Wales that people wear three-layer face coverings on public transport and other situations where they cannot avoid being closer than 2m to others. Answering journalists' questions at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Gething said: ""At this point we are continuing to look at the evidence and today's comments are part of what we'll need to consider doing as we help to keep Wales safe now and in the future."" Mr Gething said he did recognise face coverings gave some people an ""extra element"" of reassurance, but he was also concerned that the wearing of them may encourage some people to take more risks. ""It's entirely possible we'll need to make a different choice in the near future for the longer term - so I wouldn't want to try and set up a position which says absolutely no, never, we'll never change our position on masks and face coverings, but we'll do so at a time where its the right thing to do to help keep all of us safe,"" he added. Vaughan Gething said he will look at evidence from the scientific advisory group SAGE Face coverings are compulsory on public transport in England, where they should also be worn in hospitals by staff, outpatients and visitors. In Scotland, masks are mandatory on public transport, and will be in shops from 10 July. Plans to make wearing face masks on public transport compulsory in Northern Ireland have been put on hold, pending legal clarification. Speaking as the Royal Society published two reports on face coverings, Prof Ramakrishnan said the public remained ""sceptical"" about their benefits because ""the message has not been clear enough"" and guidelines have been inconsistent. ""What we would like for the government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than two metres away from the next person,"" he said ""If you're in a crowded setting, you ought to wear a mask."" Endorsing his call, Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Just as Scotland has now made face masks compulsory in shops and public transport, Welsh Government should provide a clear, unambiguous directive and make the wearing of face coverings a requirement in certain public places."" ""The battle to bring down the transmission rate and stamp out the virus continues, and face coverings have a part to play in that."" This video can not be played Masks should be used on public transport and places like supermarkets, say these people Angelo Mazzeo, from the south west of England, was at Newport station to pick up a friend before they drove to Leeds in his open top car. He said he always tries to wear a mask in public areas like the supermarket or on trains and believes it is an important way to reduce the R rate across the UK. He said: ""I think you know in crowded public areas like public transport or supermarkets, I think everyone should wear a mask, it will just keep that R value below one which will eventually kill the virus off."" He added: ""I think there should be a harmonious discussion between England, Wales and Scotland - I think face masks are important and it gives us all a reminder that the virus is still with us."" Louise Pirouet: ""I think it's not good that in Wales it's not mandatory to wear them"" Louise Pirouet, who was catching a train from Newport station, believes it is vitally important to wear a mask on public transport and in public for the safety of others. She feels, ""why should I wear a mask and not you?"" She said: ""I've noticed on the train when people are going to England they do wear them then on the train, but when you come into Wales they don't."" She added: ""I think it's not good that in Wales it's not mandatory to wear them, I think that everyone should wear them on public transport in Wales, the same as England."" Craig Higgins believes wearing a mask ""gives a false sense of security"" Craig Higgins, who lives in Gelli in Rhondda Cynon Taf, was carrying out a site survey for a prospective cycle hire scheme in Newport city centre. He believes wearing a mask ""gives a false sense of security"". He says governments across the UK have not coordinated as well as they could have. He said: ""There has been some communication between them all, I think that's fair to say. ""They've obviously taken their own stances because of those devolved powers, which is fine. ""But I think that lack of co-ordination between all of them is a bit confusing, having one rule for one place and one rule for another.""

" Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 In a small room, in a village on the outskirts of Wuhan, an elderly woman is chanting quietly and tapping out time on a table. Opposite her, another woman is crying softly. In early February, her 44-year-old brother died from coronavirus, and she cannot forgive herself. After the ceremony, Ms Wang - she doesn't want to use her full name - says that the shaman received a message from beyond the grave. Her brother, Wang Fei, had absolved her of any blame. “Feifei doesn't hold me responsible,” she says, referring to him by the name the family has used since childhood. “He was trying to comfort me and persuade me to accept his death.” Her brother died on a Covid ward, unable to see visitors; his last days lived out in a series of desperate text messages. “I feel so tired,” he wrote in one of them. “This disease has dragged on for too long.” Ms Wang’s guilt is a product of one of the cruellest aspects of this global pandemic – the enforced isolation of sufferers from their families. “I couldn’t go to the hospital to take care of him,” she tells me. “When I heard he’d died, I just couldn’t accept it. My family’s been broken into pieces.” She wants answers about her brother’s treatment - whether he was given proper care, and whether more could have been done to save him. But Ms Wang has been told by the police not to speak to the foreign media, and her choice to ignore that warning carries some risk. Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother One woman we arrange to interview arrives with plain-clothes policemen in pursuit. When she scrambles into our car, they block our way. We meet another man in the darkness on the banks of Wuhan’s East Lake. He tells us he’s been visited twice by the police for speaking out about the death of his father. For victims and journalists alike, asking questions about how and why the outbreak began in Wuhan, and whether it might have been better contained, is not easy. But at the epicentre of this global disaster, the need to ask questions is a necessity, not a choice. The day in mid-January when Wang Fei began to feel unwell, China's official death toll stood at just three. Today, more than 11 million people have been infected worldwide,at least 500,000 have died-  and the virus has forced the lockdown of entire economies. It is here where the virus was first discovered and the first attempts made to contain it. And it is here, too, where the search for its origin must begin, leading to perhaps the biggest question of them all, and one now at the heart of an escalating propaganda war between Washington and Beijing. Did the coronavirus  – as most scientists think – come from nature, or might it have leaked from a lab?  Ms Wang says her brother, who worked as a driver, hardly ever left Wuhan. Over the course of his 44 years, the central Chinese city grew from a declining industrial backwater into a booming international business and transport hub. But if Wang Fei’s life coincided with Wuhan’s extraordinary revival, then his final days ran in parallel with its descent into disaster. In early January, medics had begun to realise that the disease was highly infectious and wereimplementing their own hospital quarantine procedures. But instead of alerting the public, the authorities were silencing health workers. Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn colleagues to take precautions against infection, was reprimanded and made tosign a confession by the police. On the weekend of 18 January, with the authorities still insisting thedisease was not contagious, Wang Fei began to feel unwell. He went to hospital where he was given paracetamol for his fever and sent home. “They say there’s no human-to-human transmission, but the doctors are all wearing masks,” he told his sister. She can repeat the exact wording of the official reassurances, even now. “At that time, I was telling him that it is 'controllable and preventable,'” she says. “Only when I look back, I realise the government really didn't give enough warning. Now I know what he really needed was proper medical help. That’s what makes me feel guilty.” Mr Wang cancelled the family’s plans to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, which fell the following weekend. Instead he spent his days joining long queues outside hospitals. But with too many patients and not enough beds, he would return home exhausted. “He believed deeply that the country and government loved him,” Ms Wang says, “and that they would protect him.” On 23 January, Wuhan was put into lockdown. It was the world’s first, and became one of the longest and strictest attempts to contain the spread of the virus. But it came too late to prevent an estimated five million people leaving the city in the run-up to the national holiday. A few days later, his condition deteriorated and the family called for an ambulance. They were told there were more than 600 people ahead of them in the queue. Seven hours later he was finally admitted to hospital. Mr Wang found himself in a health system that was now totally overwhelmed. He texted his sister, complaining about the difficulty of getting staff to attend to his basic needs - such as help with drinking water. He continued to get worse. On 7 February Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor censored by the police, died in the same hospital. Mr Wang's spirits sank even lower. “If even a doctor can't survive,” he told his sister by text, “what chance have I got?” They are still silencing medics in Wuhan. Outside one hospital, we speak to a nurse who tells us about her experience on the front lines dealing with Covid-19 patients. Afterwards we exchange contact details and she cycles away. Two plain-clothes policemen, who have been watching us, emerge from the side of the street. They run alongside her with their hands on her handlebars, and bring her bike to a halt. I can see them speaking sternly to her, but by the time I catch up with them, they’ve let her go. She calls a few minutes later and asks us to delete the interview. For her safety we have no choice but to agree. The control of information, of course, has long been central to China’s system of government. In this case, it is central to the story. Wuhan’s lockdown was successful in eventually bringing the city’s outbreak under control, but China faces allegations,including from the US government, that delay and cover-up in the early stages made a global crisis inevitable. In the early stages of any disease outbreak, even days can make a big difference to the speed and scale of the spread. One studyhas suggested that if it had acted a week earlier, the number of cases in China could have been reduced by 66%. The authoritiesdeny the allegations. They insist that, in the face of a previously unknown disease, their response was swift and point out that it has been commended by theWorld Health Organization. The government is now comparing itself favourably to administrations in the West, even overtly mocking them for what it sees asa chaotic and confused response. And it is silencing those who mightchallenge that narrative. While the failings of democratic governments have been comprehensively exposed by a free press, there is no such scrutiny in China. This is a place where even trying to talk openly about your dead brother can bring you to the attention of the police. We put in requests to interview parliamentary delegates, senior health officials, academics and doctors - more than 20 people. None of our requests were granted. We sent questions to China’s health commission and its foreign and science ministries about the release of public information in the early days of the crisis. They went unanswered too. Wang Fei lived a short walk from a large market that became an early focus of the unfolding story. Despite its name, the Huanan Seafood Market is known to have had some trade in wild mammalssold there as delicacies. It is now closed. Initially, it was suspected to be ground zero for the outbreak, the place where the virusmade the leap from animals to humans. Sars-CoV-2 – as it has now been named - belongs to a family of coronaviruses named for their spikey or crown-like surfaces. A vast number of these viruses have been shown to becarried by bats. Some of them are thought to have the potential to infect humans, either when passeddirectly from a bat, or after first infecting another animal species – an intermediate host – that then comes intocontact with people. This is,one theory suggests, what triggered another coronavirus outbreak in China which first appeared in November 2002. The Sars coronavirus, now known as Sars CoV-1, is thought to have jumped from bats to humans via the civet cat - a small furry mammal sold in the markets of southern China. After the authorities failed to acknowledge the outbreak for several months, Sars went on to cause 774 deaths worldwide. Nearly two decades later, the very first cluster of Sars CoV-2 cases appeared in Mr Wang’s Wuhan neighbourhood. One study foundaround half of themhad a connection to the seafood market. It was no surprise then that there was widespread speculation the virus’s intermediate host might have been among theanimals on sale there. But this theory now appears to have beendismissed by China, following the testing of samples taken from various places inside the market. While traces of the virus were found, none were detected on any of the animal samples. Officials have concluded that the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. Most scientists remain convinced, though, that somewhere along the line, whether in a market or elsewhere, Sars-CoV-2 will have passed naturally froman animal to a human. They point to an increasing number ofsuch “spillover” eventsdriven by factors such as population growth and human encroachmenton natural habitats. Dr Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from Hong Kong University who joined the Chinese National Health Commission fact-finding trip to Wuhan in January, says the “spillover” theory is the most favoured for the origin of this virus. This is not least, he says, because such events have happened so often before, from Sars CoV-1 to other avian-flu pandemics. “H5N1 was the first wake-up, then Sars, then H7N9 in the Yangtze Delta, and now Sars-CoV-2,” he tells me. “So, if you ask me what is the highest possibility – it’s that the virus is coming out from markets, markets that are selling wildlife.” And that’s why, he argues, the trade in wild animals should remain the focus of prevention efforts. “It is not easy to change culture, but we must,” he says. Finding the source of the virus is not just a question of academic interest. If Sars-CoV-2 has come from a reservoir of infection in a particular animal species, then of course, it could continue to pose the risk of new outbreaks. In mid-May, the World Health Organization passed a resolution calling for an international effort to trace the likely intermediate animal host. It has just announced it has been given permission to send ateam of investigators to China for this purpose. But scientists agree it maynot be an easy task. We sent a number of questions to the Chinese National Health Commission and the foreign and science ministries about the work already being done in this regard. We asked if any studies had begun to test various animal species that could have spread the virus. We received no answers to our questions. Outside the shuttered Huanan Seafood Market we’re stopped from filming. “I don’t care where you’re from,” a policeman tells me when I explain that I’m a foreign journalist. “China has done a lot to contain the virus. You need to promote positive energy.” As Wang Fei lay dying in hospital, another location in Wuhan, a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood Market, was already becoming the focus of an altogether different theory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was now at the centre of a growing storm of conspiracy theories, suspicions and allegations that the virus might have leaked from a lab. They have continued to this day. The WIV’s modernist, grey concrete and glass structure, set in a leafy campus with a small lake, is clearly visible from the adjacent road. When we arrive there, we are quickly surrounded by security guards who tell us it’s a sensitive area and call the police. The institute is the world’s leading authority in the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. Its researchers are led by star scientist Professor Shi Zhengli – known as “Bat Woman” to her colleagues because of her expertise. They have spent years collecting samples from live bats in remote Chinese caves. Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab One recent paper, co-authored by Professor Shi, gives details about hundreds of bat coronaviruses, many of them previously unpublished, unveiling justhow many have been gathered. The research has included the genetic modification of some of these viruses, including the construction of new, chimeric – or hybrid – viruses, in order to examine their potential to infect humans and, potentially, cause pandemics. It was Professor Shi who discovered and sequenced the genetic code of the nearest known relative of theSars CoV-1 virus, found inside a bat from a cave in China's Yunnan Province. Ever since the Sars CoV-1 outbreak, the fear of an even deadlier, more infectious spillover event has been the driving force behind Wuhan's coronavirus research. On 2 January, just three days after becoming aware of the new virus circulating in Wuhan, she also became the first tosequence Sars-Cov-2. Ironically, it is the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 that has itself helped fuel the lab-leak theory. Some subsequent studies, includingone by Prof Shi, suggest that there is something different about its genome compared to other known coronaviruses of a similar type. Its spike proteins – the pointy bits of the “crown” that latch onto the cells of an infected host – seem to bind extremely well to human cells. While most viruses need time to adapt to a new host, Sars-CoV-2 appears to have been highly infectious from the beginning of the outbreak. One papercompared the new outbreak with the original Sars epidemic. It found that Sars-CoV-2 was already “pre-adapted” for human infection. The virus’ spike proteins also have a feature, unusual in Sars-type coronaviruses, known as a “furin cleavage site”. These arethought likelyto increase the efficiency with which the virus can penetrate the human cells, take them over and replicate inside them. It is this combination of factors – the WIV’s proximity to the outbreak, the kind of scientific work it was involved in, and the seemingly unusual nature of the virus itself – that have led to the highly controversial alternative to the natural “spillover” theory. Claims that the virus leaked from a lab first began to circulate on the Chinese internet in early February. There were unsubstantiated rumours the coronavirus may have passed from a lab-infected animal tothe local community, or that one of the WIV researchers may have themselvesbecome accidentally infected,  either with a natural virus collected from the wild, or a lab-made one. Conspiracy theories soon spread further afield, including claims in some foreign newspapers and websites that the virus may have beenan engineered “bio-weapon”. But none of the lab leak theories – animal virus, man-made virus, deliberate or accidental – have been backed up with any concrete proof, relying instead on conjecture and circumstantial evidence. A group of Indian researchers were some of the first to use the virus’ genome to hint at the possibility ofgenetic modification in a lab. But the paper was quicklydebunked and was withdrawn. However unusual the virus appeared to be, there was nothing to prove that its notable features could not have come directly from nature. In early February, Shi Zhengli herself took to social media in response. “I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote, adding that those who spread rumours should“shut their stinking mouths”. Meanwhile, Mr Wang was succumbing to some of the same notable qualities of the virus on which such theories were partly based. It was a pattern of decline now all too familiar to medics everywhere. His lungs were being ravaged by the pathogen, filling with fluid and white blood cells, and the oxygen in his blood was plummeting. “My heartbeat rate is 160 per min. My blood oxygen saturation is only 70. It’s killing me,” he texted his sister. The following day, on 8 February, he sent one last message. “Please save me,” it read, “I can see stars.” He died a few hours later.  On 30 April, the US president waded into the controversy. He was asked by a reporter: “Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?” “Yes, I have. Yes, I have,”Donald Trump replied. Other administration officials have weighed in, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming what he claimed was China’s“history of running sub-standard laboratories”. But despite the US saying to have “enormous evidence” for a lab leak, none has been provided. With the theory now central to an escalating geopolitical dispute between the US and China, critics of President Trump’s handling of the response at home see it as a sensationalist smokescreen todeflect domestic blame. Mindful that they could be drawn into a quagmire of conspiracy and propaganda, some scientists, however, believe that the lab leak question should not be dismissed out-of-hand. It relates, they say, to one of the major scientific debates of our time and it has implications not just for China but for the US government too. The work of the WIV, in collecting large numbers of bat coronaviruses and experimenting on them, has not been a lone venture. It has been part of a majorinternational effortfocused on the growing risk of spillover events and the threat of new, human pandemics. Some of Wuhan’s research has involved collaborations withUS scientistsand the backing of generous amounts ofUS funding. And its creation of chimeric viruses - the stitching together of parts of the genomes of different viruses to make new ones - uses an easily accessible technique commonplace in labs around the world. Such research has  been the subject of an intense disagreement between scientists about the benefits andrisks of such research. Supporters say it can help us to anticipate how viruses might emerge in the wild and has the potential to help with the development of medicines and vaccines. Those against, say it risks doing the exact opposite. Manipulating viruses – to make them more infectious or more deadly – could, they say, spark off a man-made pandemic with a lab-made virus. The risks might include lab workers becoming infected – perhaps unknowingly – when collecting virus samples from animals in the field, when handling animals kept in the lab, or when experimenting with live viruses. Since the Sars CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, for example, there have been four separate leaks from labs studying that disease. Two of the incidents were at the National Institute of Virology inBeijing in 2004. During one of them, a researcher caught Sars after spending two weeks at the lab. She went on to infect her mother, who died, as well as a nurse, who in turn infected several other people. The coincidence of a new pandemic coronavirus appearing in the same city as a laboratory devoted to studying them is something that Prof Shi Zhengli appeared to initially acknowledge. When she learned of the outbreak at the end of December, her thoughts turned to the viruses stored in the institute's freezers. In an interview with Scientific American, she says she remembers thinking that if coronaviruses had sparked the pandemic:“Could they have come from our lab?” While the lab leak theory has smouldered away both online and in Washington political circles, it has largely beendismissed by scientists. It is a scientific consensus that has, in turn, fed into mainstream media coverage, with now wide acceptance that a natural, spillover event is the most probablecause of Sars-CoV-2. The dismissal is based not just on the fact that such spillovers have happened before, but on a key piece of evidence that has come from Prof Shi Zhengli herself. Concerned to rule out her lab’s involvement in the outbreak, according to the Scientific American interview, she began “frantically” searching the experimental records and samples already stored in her lab. HerFebruary paperreported what she said was the closest match she was able to find. A virus, which she named RaTG13, collected from a bat in 2013, showed a 96.2% similarity to Sars-CoV-2. Although that sounds close, the 3.8% genetic difference between the two would, estimates suggest, take decades of evolutionary change tooccur in nature. If Sars-CoV-2 had leaked from her collection of coronaviruses, the lab would have contained either Sars-CoV-2 itself, or something much, much closer related. “That really took a load off my mind,” Prof Shi told Scientific American. “I had not slept a wink for days.” But the evidence that has undoubtedly had the most bearing on the discussion about a possible lab leak was contained in a paper published in March in the medical journal,Nature Medicine. It has become widely accepted as proof that the virus was not made in a lab. The unusual features of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein discussed earlier – its high binding affinity to human cells and its furin cleavage site – must have, the authors argue, come from nature. Their evidence is partly based on the use of sophisticated computer modelling. If a scientist had used such models in advance, they argue, to analyse how strongly the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein might bind to human cells, the results would predict a far weaker bond than actually turns out to be the case. In other words, a computer would be unable to foresee the binding strength of the virus. Therefore, they argue, no scientist is likely to have set out to create it in a lab. Furthermore, they imply, to create Sars-CoV-2 in a lab, you’d need to start with a virus with a much closer genetic match than RaTG13, the distant ancestor found in the Wuhan freezer. A new virus cannot be made from a virus that does not exist. Far more likely, they say, that the virus picked up its notable features while circulating, undetected, in humans or animals for months or years before the outbreak. “We very carefully considered a potential link to the lab - we did not dismiss this possibility out of hand,” the paper’s lead author Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US tells me. “And it is clear - all the available data is fully consistent with a natural history of Sars-CoV-2. There is no scientific data showing any link to the lab. “Most theories considering a link to the lab are conspiracy theories,” he adds. “They are exceptionally disruptive to the efforts of getting Covid-19 under control and result in unnecessary human suffering.” Despite the wide acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Nature Medicine Paper, there are stillsome scientistswho refuse to see it as conclusive proof that the virus wasn’t manipulated in some way. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide and Chairman and Research Director of Vaxine, a company leading Australia's search for a Covid-19 vaccine, believes that laboratory manipulation has to remain under consideration for being behind a possible explanation for Sars-CoV-2’s“surprising”ability to bind to human cells. And he rejects the argument that if it wasn’t pre-planned by a computer model, it didn’t happen. “In science a lot of things are done on the basis of give-it-a-go, and a lot of things happen completely by accident,” he tells me. “You know, a lot of Nobel prizes have been won on the basis of accidents.” Others referto Wuhan’spast experimentsin which genome segments from different viruses have been stitched together to investigate how spike proteins bind to human cells. And they point out that there is no way of knowing whether or not Wuhan does in fact have, among the hundreds of coronaviruses it has collected, anything closer in genetic make-up to Sars-CoV-2 than RaTG13. What’s more, RaTG13 is itself the subject of some speculation. The BBC has had it confirmed, from the researchers running a respectedChinese database, that it is the same virus as one that the WIV previously referred to as RaBatCov/4991inthis paper. There is no explanation for the change of name, but that 2016 paper makes it clear that the virus appears to be a new strain of Sars-type coronavirus. Professor Petrovsky says it would be odd if the WIV, given its interest in such viruses, hadn’t continued to work on it. But there is no more mention of it at all until this year, when RaBatCov/4991 re-emerged under its new name RaTG13 as the closest known relative of Sars-CoV-2. Professor Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University in the US, says there is only one way to conclusively rule out any form of a lab leak. “A credible investigation would need unrestricted access by investigators to facilities, samples, records, and personnel, as well as unrestricted environmental sampling of facilities and serological sampling of personnel,” he tells me. The US government said in a statement in April that the intelligence community does not believe the virus was modified or created, but the government continues “to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of anaccident at a laboratory in Wuhan”. We put in a request to speak to Professor Shi Zhengli but it was turned down. We sent questions to the WIV asking whether any investigation had been carried out and, if not, whether they’d be willing to allow one. Again, there was no response. Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days. Afraid that she might be infected, Ms Wang was too worried to join her mother at home, so stuck it out in the office, surviving on simple meals. She was joined by her brother’s 13-year-old daughter, while his widow, also infected with coronavirus, recovered in hospital. “I kept writing down memories of my brother,” Ms Wang tells me, “and then posted them on social media in order to ease my empty feelings and hopelessness.” After the lockdown was lifted on 8 April she emerged into a city that had, through an extraordinary collective effort and the forced ordeal of lockdown, vanquished the virus. Today, Wuhan is returning to life. But the signs of the lingering economic impact can still be seen. In one of the usually vibrant night-markets people are eating and socialising again, but many of the tables are empty. “Customer numbers are down by two-thirds,” one woman selling boiled frogs tells me. There are signs of something else here too. Early in the lockdown, in the chaos and confusion of that moment, the censorship controls appeared to briefly vanish. People vented their anger on social media about the perceived official failings, and their grief, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang. Today though, a different narrative has taken hold. “China united together to prevent the epidemic,” says another trader, selling yellow-croaker fish on sticks. “But you foreigners don’t know how to protect yourselves.” And the market customers appear to have absorbed yet another origin theory which has been promoted by Chinese state media andsome senior officials. “I think the virus came from the US,” one woman tells me. “In the early stage of the outbreak, US soldiers were visiting Wuhan. They left early in a chartered plane.” In the absence of independent evidence, politics and propaganda are filling the vacuum with both the US and China continuing to trade unsubstantiated allegations. And without it, it is impossible to answer the big questions. How might a spillover event be better contained next time? And how do we properly balance the benefits of the study of pandemic viruses, in a growing number ofvirology labs, against the risks? Scientists who support such work are convinced that Sars-CoV-2 is an incentive to redouble their efforts. “The mission must go on,” Professor Shi Zhengli says, with a plan to sample bat viruses on a much bigger scale. Something Professor Richard Ebright, from Rutgers, calls the“definition of insanity”. China has, under some diplomatic pressure, agreed to anindependent investigationinto the international response to the virus, although it is unclear what the remit will be, who will take part, and when it might happen. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it will have to wait until thepandemic is over. Meanwhile Ms Wang says she intends to continue to fight for answers about her brother’s death. She insists the warnings from the police to keep quiet won’t stop her. “I’m a law abiding citizen,” she says. She does not want us to publish her full name simply to minimise the risk of online abuse, not because she is trying to hide from the authorities. Sometimes it is in the individual stories that the true, global impact of the virus really hits home. Four months after Wang Fei died, Ms Wang has only just told her mother what really happened. The family, fearing she would be unable to bear the news, allowed her to believe her son was still in quarantine. In the end, they could hide it no longer. “For several days my mum couldn’t fall asleep,” Ms Wang tells me. “A woman born before the founding of our country can’t understand why such a tragedy can happen in modern times.”   ",Negative,0.23207492
"Bats were probably the source of the current coronavirus pandemic, epidemiologists says Zoonotic diseases - which jump from animals to humans - are increasing and will continue to do so without action to protect wildlife and preserve the environment, UN experts have warned. They blame the rise in diseases such as Covid-19 on high demand for animal protein, unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change. Neglected zoonotic diseases kill two million people a year, they say. Covid-19 is set to cost the global economy $9tn (Â£7.2tn) over two years. Why are we catching more diseases from animals? Ebola, West Nile virus and Sars are also all zoonotic diseases: they started in animals, and made the jump to humans. But that jump is not automatic. It is driven, according to the reportby the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Livestock Research Institute,external, by the degradation of our natural environment - for example through land degradation, wildlife exploitation, resource extraction and climate change. This alters the way animals and humans interact. A lone man and a cow are seen by a submerged house after a dam collapse in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Photo: January 2019 ""In the last century we have seen at least six major outbreaks of novel coronaviruses,"" said Inger Andersen, under-secretary general and executive director of the UN Environment Programme. ""Over the last two decades and before Covid-19, zoonotic diseases caused economic damage of $100bn (Â£80bn)."" She said that ""two million people in low- and middle-income countries die each year from neglected endemic zoonotic diseases - such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis and rabies"". ""These are often communities with complex development problems, high dependence on livestock and proximity to wildlife."" Meat production, for example, has increased by 260% in the last 50 years, Ms Andersen said. ""We have intensified agriculture, expanded infrastructure and extracted resources at the expense of our wild spaces,"" she explained. ""Dams, irrigation and factory farms are linked to 25% of infectious diseases in humans. Travel, transport and food supply chains have erased borders and distances. Climate change has contributed to the spread of pathogens.""

""The science is clear that if we keep exploiting wildlife and destroying our ecosystems, then we can expect to see a steady stream of these diseases jumping from animals to humans in the years ahead,"" Ms Andersen said.

The head of the UK's national academy of science has called for everyone to carry a face covering when they leave home in order to tackle coronavirus. Currently, face coverings are compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, but advised to be worn elsewhere. From 10 July, masks will be required in shops. In Wales and Northern Ireland coverings are not compulsory. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, said the coverings should then be worn ""whenever you are in crowded public spaces"". He said evidence shows they protect the wearer and those nearby, and the UK was ""way behind"" other countries in usage. No 10 said the use of face masks is always kept ""under review"".

Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes The country's new president has insisted on a tougher stance Burundi  has launched a mass testing campaign for
coronavirus, in a fresh campaign by the new government to fight the spread of the
pandemic. Former president Pierre Nkurunziza was accused of
downplaying the issue, saying ""God had cleared [coronavirus] from Burundi's skies"", almost a fortnight before he died last month of cardiac arrest. But last week, his successor Evariste Ndayishimiye, declared
coronavirus a ""major enemy of Burundians"" and vowed ""to start the fight against
that enemy"". At the launch of the
campaign in Bujumbura, many people were, unusually, seen wearing masks. A record 640 tests were taken on the day, the highest number since March when the virus was first reported in the country. Burundi has so far reported 191 cases from 3,200
tests done in the past three months. Your fringe is sweeping your chin, you can comb your leg hair and you've got a monobrow.

According to a report from the state's Agency for Health Care Administration, the hospitals are spread out across 25 of the state's 67 counties. More than 300 hospitals were included in the report, but not all of those have ICUs. Cases of the virus have surged in US southern states, including in Florida. In the last week, Florida has recorded more than 10,000 new cases in a 24-hour period three times in the last week. The state's total death toll is now more than 3,800. We will be hearing from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, as he delivers his summer statement. Among those particularly interested in what he has to say are some of the young people whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So is there anything the chancellor could announce in his speech on Wednesday to help them? BBC Business spoke to some of themto find out. At least 84 prisoners and nine prison guards and employees have died from the coronavirus so far, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The latest victim was Correctional Officer V Kenneth Harbin, 60, who died on 4 July. According to figures released last week by Texas officials, 8,811 offenders and 1,556 employees have tested positive. Prisons and jails around the US have been outbreak epicentres since the early days of the pandemic. Inmates have no ability to practice social distancing and sometimes little access to basic hygiene products such as soap and warm water. In California, San Quentin prison has been hit by a deadly outbreak after infected prisoners were transferred there from another facility. As of Monday, six San Quentin inmates have died and another 1,387 inmates have tested positive. Officials say they are urgently trying to reduce the prison's population to below 3,000. San Quentin prison is the worst affected detention centre in California We reported earlier that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro hastested positive for coronavirus. Now, footage shows him removing his mask in front of a group of reporters. Shortly after confirming his test result, he stepped back a few feet and took off the mask. He then told journalists that he looked ""fine"". Mr Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, and has called it a ""little flu"". This video can not be played The number of Covid-19 deaths and infections in Brazil is second only to the US Dr Mike Ryan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization (WHO), has sent his'get well soon' wishes to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaroand said that his infection should serve as an example for others. ""We wish him a speedy and full recovery from this disease,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the message to us all is: we are vulnerable to this virus.â WHO regional director Carissa Etienne echoed his comment while speaking from Washington DC to the directors of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). ""This is a pandemic of staggering proportions and we have no option but to continue to put all our energy into controlling it,"" she warned. PAHO director for communicable diseases Marcos Espinal added: ""The message is that this virus in unpredictable and does not respect race, class or people in power, despite security around any president.""

The US ambassador to Brazil, who hosted President Jair Bolsonaro at an American Independence Day Party over the weekend, will undergo testing amid news that the Brazilian leader has been infected with Covid-19. On Saturday, Mr Bolsonaro was photographed by the Brazilian foreign minister embracing US Ambassador Todd Chapman at the 4 July celebration. After Mr Bolsonaro displayed Covid-19 symptoms on Monday, the US embassytweeted,external(in Portuguese) that Mr Chapman ""has no symptoms, but he is taking precautions"". The US statement added that he will be tested and and will ""follow the screening protocols"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US federal government will pay $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) to drug maker Novavax to produce 100m coronavirus doses. The payment is the largest made so far by theUS ""Operation Warp Speed""- a partnership between the federal government and the private sector to find acoronavirus vaccine- and the fourth made to a drug manufacturer. Novavax, which is based in Maryland, has never before brought a product to market, according to the New York Times. âAdding Novavaxâs candidate to Operation Warp Speedâs diverse portfolio of vaccines increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,â US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement on Tuesday. Novavax CEO Stanley Erck told CNN on Monday that the deal with the US government ""speaks to the confidence that they have in our platform to be able to develop a vaccine"". He added that the company aims to ship out 100m vaccination doses by February 2021. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took his fourth coronavirus test on Monday after developing Covid-19 symptoms, has tested positive for the virus. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks posed by the virus, calling it ""a little flu"" and saying that he would not be seriously affected by it. He has also urged regional governors to ease lockdowns, which he says hurt the economy, and on Monday he watered down regulations on wearing face masks. As of Monday, the number of deaths in Brazil was over 65,000 and infections were over 1.6m, second only to the United States. Read more here. The latestfigures from the Department of Health and Social care,externalhave been released, showing that a further 155 people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus. It makes the total number of deaths after a positive test in hospitals, care homes and the wider community 44,391. But it does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK. That figure is now thought to have passed 55,000. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there were 581 positive test results. A total of 286,349 cases have been confirmed in all. No 10 has rejected calls for Boris Johnson to apologise after he said""too many care homes didn't really follow procedures"" over coronavirus. Labour called the PM's comments ""crass"" and said government advice to care homes had been ""conflicting"".
And one union accused the PM of blaming care workers for government ""failings"". ButDowning Streetsaid Mr Johnson had been pointing out that not enough was known about the virus in the early stages of the outbreak.
The PM's official spokesman added that the care homes had ""done a brilliant job under very difficult circumstances"" and the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". Care homes were hit particularly badly by the coronaviruswith nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died of coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales since the outbreak. Israel has seen a surge in infections since it opened schools and businesses in May Israel's director of public health has resigned after the country experienced a sharp rise in cases. Siegal Sadetzki, an epidemiologist, criticised the government's response and said it had lifted lockdown restrictions too quickly. âThe achievements in dealing with the first wave [of infections] were cancelled out by the broad and swift opening of the economy,"" she wrote in a statement. Israel imposed a national lockdown in April, and by the following month it had reduced the number of new cases to about 20 a day. But it reopened schools and businesses shortly after and the rate of infection rose sharply. The daily number of new cases hit 1,000 last week. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country needed to take âlimited actionsâ to avoid another full lockdown. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain must ""build, build, build"" to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis Boris Johnson has said now is the time to be ""ambitious"" about the UK's future, as he set out a post-coronavirus recovery plan. The PM vowed to ""use this moment"" to fix longstanding economic problems and promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure. Plans set out in the Tory election manifesto would be speeded up and ""intensified,"" he added. Labour and the CBI said he was not focusing enough on saving jobs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""not much of a deal and not much that's new"". The BBC's economic editor, Faisal Islam, said there was ""nothing really new"" in the plans, but was a pledge from the Treasury to ""speed up capital investment that has already been announced and tolerate higher levels of debt"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak later confirmed he would deliver an economic update on 8 July ""setting out the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". The PM's speech came asnew figures showed the UK economyshrank faster than at any time since 1979 between January and March. Boris Johnson's economy speech fact-checked What a shrinking economy means in one town Where do governments go when they need money? In a wide-ranging speech in Dudley, in the West Midlands, Mr Johnson vowed to ""build, build, build"" to soften the ""economic aftershock"" of coronavirus. He said the government wanted to continue with its plans to ""level up"" - one of its main slogans of last December's election - as ""too many parts"" of the country had been ""left behind, neglected, unloved"". Infrastructure projects in England would be ""accelerated"" and there would be investment in new academy schools, green buses and new broadband, the PM added. Projects in the Â£5bn investment plan include: Â£1.5bn for hospital maintenance and building, eradicating mental health dormitories and improving A&E capacity - the government said this is ""new"" money in addition to Â£1.1bn in its Spring Budget Â£100m for 29 road projects including bridge repairs in Sandwell and improving the A15 in the Humber region - this money had already been announced Over Â£1bn for new school buildings, as announced on Monday - this cash comes from the government's existing infrastructure plan Â£12bn to help build 180,000 new affordable homes for ownership and rent over the next eight years - brings together three pots of money already announced by previous Tory governments and Mr Johnson's administration Other projects announced in the government's Spring Budget, which will now be accelerated, include: Â£83m for maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities, and Â£60m for temporary prison places. Â£900m for ""shovel ready"" local projects in England this year and in 2021 Â£500,000 - Â£1m for each area in the towns fund to spend on improvements to parks, high street and transport Mr Johnson acknowledged jobs might be lost because of the economic hit from the pandemic, but said a new ""opportunity guarantee"" would ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Asked whether the plans went far enough for those who end up unemployed, the PM said the strategy was for ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and there would not be a return to austerity. But he could not put a figure on how many roles would be created through his plan, adding: ""We don't yet know what the full economic impact is going to be... [but] we will do everything we can to get this economy moving."" The prime minister loves a big, historical comparison. He is a keen student of Winston Churchill - and has even written a book about him. Over the last few days, the comparisons the government has sought to draw have been with former American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his ""New Deal."" Asmy colleagues at Reality Check point out, the plan set out today is a tiddler compared to what FDR did, and a fair chunk of it is re-announcing what we already knew the government was planning. But Boris Johnson is attempting to set out in a broader context the government's vision - and his pride in saying he wants to spend a lot to revitalise the economy and haul it out of the doldrums. Under what Mr Johnson dubbed ""project speed,"" planning laws would also be streamlined to encourage building. Changes, planned for September, include: Allowing many commercial buildings to change to residential use without planning application Cutting the normal planning process for builders who want to demolish and rebuild vacant residential and commercial buildings as homes Allowing homeowners to build above their properties ""via a fast track approval process"" and subject to neighbour consultation Pubs, libraries, village shops will be protected from the changes as they were ""essential to the lifeblood of communities,"" the government said. Mr Johnson acknowledged the planning changes might meet resistance in traditional Tory-voting areas, but said: ""Sometimes you have got to get on with things."" The government believes their existing plans for boosting infrastructure spending are already a significant fillip to the economy, and they want to see what happens as it re-opens. One set of figures released today shows household savings increased during lockdown, but will people have the confidence to spend? The scale of government support for businesses and employees in recent months probably does justify New Deal-style rhetoric. Extending support at that level may yet be required, and is far from ruled out. But for now, they are holding fire as they assess the permanent scars to the UK economy. Mr Johnson also attempted to calm Tory fears that he had shifted to the left, saying: ""I am not a communist"". Instead, he claimed he had been inspired by US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who led America out of the Great Depression with his New Deal in the 1930s. In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, President Roosevelt launched one of the largest, most expensive US government programmes which included building schools, hospitals and dams. Youth Worker Lisa Williams is worried young people will be hit hard In the former ""red wall"" seat of Rother Valley - which the Conservatives won from Labour for the first time at last year's general election - there has been a mixed reaction to the announcement from employees and business owners. David Shaw, operations manager for a manufacturing company, said the investment announcement was ""positive"" and praised the government's furlough scheme during the crisis for saving businesses. But Lisa Williams, manager of a youth and community centre in Dinnington, said of the promised investment that ""we've yet to see that happen"". ""Year-on-year, successive governments have made promises, and these areas have yet to see that,"" she said, adding she was concerned about the economic impact on young people. And Jayne Maxwell, a shop owner in Maltby, said she was sceptical about how much investment would go into high streets, saying more short-term help was needed. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We're facing an economic crisis, the biggest we've seen in a generation and the recovery needs to match that. What's been announced amounts to less than Â£100 per person. ""And it's the re-announcement of many manifesto pledges and commitments, so it's not enough."" Sir Keir Starmer says more focus is needed on jobs The Labour leader added: ""We're not going to argue against a recovery plan, but the focus has to be on jobs."" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister had set out the ""first steps on the path to recovery"" but added that ""the focus on rescuing viable firms cannot slip"".

"The government faces a post-lockdown choice between green growth or propping up polluting industries The UK must avoid lurching from the coronavirus crisis into a deeper climate crisis, the governmentâs advisers have warned. They recommend that ministers ensure funds earmarked for a post-Covid-19 economic recovery go to firms that will reduce carbon emissions. They say the public should work from home if possible; and to walk or cycle. And investment should prioritise broadband over road-building, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says. People should also be encouraged to save emissions by continuing to consult GPs online. The government will reply later, although the Energy Secretary Alok Sharma has already spoken in favour of a green recovery to the recession. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red' In a letter to the Prime Minister, the committee says jobless people should be re-trained for work in geographically-spread labour-intensive âgreenâ industries such as home insulation; tree-planting; and peatland restoration. Road building should have a lower priority than broadband, the report says It makes a veiled reference to the current discussions over a potential government bailout to save jobs in aviation, which is struggling in the crisis. The letter says: âMany sectors of the UK economy do not currently bear the full costs of emitting greenhouse gases. Revenue could be raised by setting or raising carbon prices for these sectors.â Green groups say any bailout should include a condition that the industry shrinks until it finds a technological solution to its carbon emissions. The letter also tackles broader social themes of fairness and risk. It says the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted inequalities, with poorer people more in danger. The committee notes: âThe response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people - who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change. âThe benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely, and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. âIt is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new, resilient economy.â What is climate change? Climate-related words and phrases explained How much warmer is your city? What is your diet's carbon footprint? Where we are in seven charts The committee says the government must produce policies that allow the UK to reduce emissions to Net Zero in an orderly way â unlike the chaos of the Covid-19 crisis. The CCC Chairman, Lord Deben, said: âThe Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of planning well for the risks the country faces. âRecovery means investing in new jobs, cleaner air and improved health. The actions needed to tackle climate change are central to rebuilding our economy. âThe government must prioritise actions that reduce climate risks and avoid measures that lock-in higher emissions.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The message is not uncontested. Some politicians have argued that jobs must be protected at all cost in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession. The UK will chair a vital global climate conference next year. Lord Deben said the UK should set a global example by planning a climate-friendly recovery from Covid-19. The committee has copied the letter to the leaders of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. It will expand on its advice in June. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says the government should harness the lessons from the Covid-19 crisis tocreate a better society overall.,external She says ministers should force firms to show how they will meet CO2 cuts, and give people a right to locally-produced food; affordable clean energy; and access to green space. The environment consultancy EPR says ministers should change the balance of the planning process to ensure that green space is a top priority rather than a nice-to-have.

The head of the UK's national academy of science has called for everyone to carry a face covering when they leave home in order to tackle coronavirus. Currently, face coverings are compulsory on public transport in England and Scotland, but advised to be worn elsewhere. From 10 July, masks will be required in shops. In Wales and Northern Ireland coverings are not compulsory. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, said the coverings should then be worn ""whenever you are in crowded public spaces"". He said evidence shows they protect the wearer and those nearby, and the UK was ""way behind"" other countries in usage. No 10 said the use of face masks is always kept ""under review"".

If you didn't think you'd ever see the Duchess of Cornwall and TikTok in the same sentence, well neither did we. Camilla - who is married to Prince Charles - has been speaking to Dame Judi Dench about their shared experience of having to use the internet in lockdown to keep in touch with family. Camilla guest edited The Emma Barnett show for BBC Radio 5 Live today. Dame Judi told Camilla about her new found fame on TikTok (largely thanks to her grandson) saying: ""I love TikTok stardom better than anything."" Parents of school-age children in Wales are still waiting to find out exactly what will happen in the new term in September. Now Education Minister Kirsty Williams has said any decision on how schools will return will be based on coronavirus transmission rates. Regular reviews are to be carried out during the summer, she says. She hopes to outline her plan for pupils this week. Pressure has been growing on the Welsh government to reveal how many schools might return.Read the full story here. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes The country's new president has insisted on a tougher stance Burundi  has launched a mass testing campaign for
coronavirus, in a fresh campaign by the new government to fight the spread of the
pandemic. Former president Pierre Nkurunziza was accused of
downplaying the issue, saying ""God had cleared [coronavirus] from Burundi's skies"", almost a fortnight before he died last month of cardiac arrest. But last week, his successor Evariste Ndayishimiye, declared
coronavirus a ""major enemy of Burundians"" and vowed ""to start the fight against
that enemy"". At the launch of the
campaign in Bujumbura, many people were, unusually, seen wearing masks. A record 640 tests were taken on the day, the highest number since March when the virus was first reported in the country. Burundi has so far reported 191 cases from 3,200
tests done in the past three months. Your fringe is sweeping your chin, you can comb your leg hair and you've got a monobrow. Before anyone puts finger to keyboard to complain, all of these things are FINE if that's your look. However, if you are feeling the need for a bit of bodily grooming,here's a handy guideto what we know so far about reopening hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons in Wales (and what no-one knows yet).

According to a report from the state's Agency for Health Care Administration, the hospitals are spread out across 25 of the state's 67 counties. More than 300 hospitals were included in the report, but not all of those have ICUs. Cases of the virus have surged in US southern states, including in Florida. In the last week, Florida has recorded more than 10,000 new cases in a 24-hour period three times in the last week. The state's total death toll is now more than 3,800. We will be hearing from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, as he delivers his summer statement. Among those particularly interested in what he has to say are some of the young people whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. There could be more than one million young workers who are without a job, if the overall UK level of unemployment goes up from the current 4% of workers to 10%,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. On top of that, under-30s have been hardest hitby a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials. So is there anything the chancellor could announce in his speech on Wednesday to help them? BBC Business spoke to some of themto find out. At least 84 prisoners and nine prison guards and employees have died from the coronavirus so far, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The latest victim was Correctional Officer V Kenneth Harbin, 60, who died on 4 July. According to figures released last week by Texas officials, 8,811 offenders and 1,556 employees have tested positive. Prisons and jails around the US have been outbreak epicentres since the early days of the pandemic. Inmates have no ability to practice social distancing and sometimes little access to basic hygiene products such as soap and warm water. In California, San Quentin prison has been hit by a deadly outbreak after infected prisoners were transferred there from another facility. As of Monday, six San Quentin inmates have died and another 1,387 inmates have tested positive. Officials say they are urgently trying to reduce the prison's population to below 3,000. San Quentin prison is the worst affected detention centre in California We reported earlier that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro hastested positive for coronavirus. Now, footage shows him removing his mask in front of a group of reporters. Shortly after confirming his test result, he stepped back a few feet and took off the mask. He then told journalists that he looked ""fine"". Mr Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, and has called it a ""little flu"". This video can not be played The number of Covid-19 deaths and infections in Brazil is second only to the US Dr Mike Ryan, emergencies director for the World Health Organization (WHO), has sent his'get well soon' wishes to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaroand said that his infection should serve as an example for others. ""We wish him a speedy and full recovery from this disease,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think the message to us all is: we are vulnerable to this virus.â WHO regional director Carissa Etienne echoed his comment while speaking from Washington DC to the directors of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). ""This is a pandemic of staggering proportions and we have no option but to continue to put all our energy into controlling it,"" she warned. PAHO director for communicable diseases Marcos Espinal added: ""The message is that this virus in unpredictable and does not respect race, class or people in power, despite security around any president."" Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent This morning I installed Ireland's just-released contact-tracing app on my phone, where it joined Germany's Corona Warn-App, which was released three weeks ago. Gibraltar recently released its Beat Covid Gibraltar app, based on the Irish code. The Republic's Covid Tracker software is also the foundation of an app Northern Ireland is promising to release within weeks. And now there's a hint Wales could go the same way. ""We remain in discussion about a range of options to achieve a working app, including development in Northern Ireland,"" a Welsh Government spokesman told the BBC. So when is England finally going to get its app? Find out more here. The US ambassador to Brazil, who hosted President Jair Bolsonaro at an American Independence Day Party over the weekend, will undergo testing amid news that the Brazilian leader has been infected with Covid-19. On Saturday, Mr Bolsonaro was photographed by the Brazilian foreign minister embracing US Ambassador Todd Chapman at the 4 July celebration. After Mr Bolsonaro displayed Covid-19 symptoms on Monday, the US embassytweeted,external(in Portuguese) that Mr Chapman ""has no symptoms, but he is taking precautions"". The US statement added that he will be tested and and will ""follow the screening protocols"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US federal government will pay $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) to drug maker Novavax to produce 100m coronavirus doses. The payment is the largest made so far by theUS ""Operation Warp Speed""- a partnership between the federal government and the private sector to find acoronavirus vaccine- and the fourth made to a drug manufacturer. Novavax, which is based in Maryland, has never before brought a product to market, according to the New York Times. âAdding Novavaxâs candidate to Operation Warp Speedâs diverse portfolio of vaccines increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,â US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement on Tuesday. Novavax CEO Stanley Erck told CNN on Monday that the deal with the US government ""speaks to the confidence that they have in our platform to be able to develop a vaccine"". He added that the company aims to ship out 100m vaccination doses by February 2021. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took his fourth coronavirus test on Monday after developing Covid-19 symptoms, has tested positive for the virus. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks posed by the virus, calling it ""a little flu"" and saying that he would not be seriously affected by it. He has also urged regional governors to ease lockdowns, which he says hurt the economy, and on Monday he watered down regulations on wearing face masks. As of Monday, the number of deaths in Brazil was over 65,000 and infections were over 1.6m, second only to the United States. Read more here. The latestfigures from the Department of Health and Social care,externalhave been released, showing that a further 155 people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus. It makes the total number of deaths after a positive test in hospitals, care homes and the wider community 44,391. But it does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK. That figure is now thought to have passed 55,000. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Tuesday, there were 581 positive test results. A total of 286,349 cases have been confirmed in all. No 10 has rejected calls for Boris Johnson to apologise after he said""too many care homes didn't really follow procedures"" over coronavirus. Labour called the PM's comments ""crass"" and said government advice to care homes had been ""conflicting"".
And one union accused the PM of blaming care workers for government ""failings"". ButDowning Streetsaid Mr Johnson had been pointing out that not enough was known about the virus in the early stages of the outbreak.
The PM's official spokesman added that the care homes had ""done a brilliant job under very difficult circumstances"" and the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". Care homes were hit particularly badly by the coronaviruswith nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died of coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales since the outbreak. Israel has seen a surge in infections since it opened schools and businesses in May Israel's director of public health has resigned after the country experienced a sharp rise in cases. Siegal Sadetzki, an epidemiologist, criticised the government's response and said it had lifted lockdown restrictions too quickly. âThe achievements in dealing with the first wave [of infections] were cancelled out by the broad and swift opening of the economy,"" she wrote in a statement. Israel imposed a national lockdown in April, and by the following month it had reduced the number of new cases to about 20 a day. But it reopened schools and businesses shortly after and the rate of infection rose sharply. The daily number of new cases hit 1,000 last week. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country needed to take âlimited actionsâ to avoid another full lockdown. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hundreds of thousands of homeowners will receive vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements, with the poorest getting up to Â£10,000. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out a Â£2bn grant scheme in England for projects such as insulation as part of a wider Â£3bn plan to cut emissions. The Treasury said the grants could help to support more than 100,000 jobs. Labour said renters appeared to be left out and called for a ""broader and bigger"" plan to cut carbon emissions. It comes ahead of a summer statement from Mr Sunak on Wednesday, in which he could announce changes to stamp duty and VAT. Business leaders and a former chancellor have called for radical action to bolster the economy, which is still reeling from the impact of coronavirus. Under the Green Homes Grant, the government will pay at least two-thirds of the cost of home improvements that save energy, the Treasury said. For example, a homeowner of a semi-detached or end-of-terrace house could install cavity wall and floor insulation for about Â£4,000 - the homeowner would pay Â£1,320 while the government would contribute Â£2,680. Coronavirus: UK warned to avoid climate change crisis Coronavirus: Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Coronavirus recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' The scheme will launch in September, with online applications for recommended energy efficiency measures, along with details of accredited local suppliers. Once one of these suppliers has provided a quote and the work is approved, the voucher is issued. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Business Secretary Alok Sharma added that the poorest households could receive up to Â£10,000 towards costs, and that double glazing would also be covered by the scheme. He continued: ""What [the scheme] ultimately means is lower bills for households, hundreds of pounds off energy bills every year, it's supporting jobs and is very good news for the environment."" The chancellor is rumoured to be planning changes to stamp duty to help the housing market The government said about half of the fund - which is due to be spent in one financial year - will go to the poorest homeowners, who will not have to contribute anything to the cost. Better insulation could save some people Â£600 a year on energy bills, the Treasury said. Mr Sunak said the investment would also help to ""kick-start our economy"" by creating thousands of jobs and providing business for existing skilled workers, as the UK recovers from the economic shock of coronavirus. ""As Britain recovers from the outbreak, it's vital we do everything in our power to support and protect livelihoods across the nation,"" he said. The governmentwill pledge to provide 30,000 new traineeshipsto get young people in England into work, giving firms Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer According to reports, there could be a short-term VAT cut for the ailing hospitality industry to help lift demand However, the Observer reported that plans to give all adults Â£500 and children Â£250 in vouchers to spend on hospitality were being considered as an alternative The chancellor is also likely to announce a stamp duty holiday, reportedly aimed at first time buyers. The grants are part of a wider Â£3bn ""green investment"" package due to be announced in the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday, to support efforts to rebuild the economy after the pandemic. The plan aims to create tens of thousands of new jobs while helping the UK meet its 2050 target of achieving net zero carbon emissions. It will involve improving insulation in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and retro-fitting low-carbon heating technology to social housing. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The Conservative manifesto had pledged Â£9.2bn for improving the energy efficiency of low income housing and public buildings. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband welcomed the plan but stressed that it was not ""comprehensive"". ""It appears there is almost nothing for the people who rent the 8.5 million homes in the social rented sector and private rented sector, which has the worst energy efficiency standards. That means one-third of people are left out,"" he said. The Treasury says the Â£3bn investment plan will cut energy bills by an average of Â£200 for some of the UK's poorest households Mr Miliband said the government needed ""a much broader and bigger-scale strategy"" to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, including investing in nature conservation, increasing renewable energy, supporting manufacturers to be greener and improving transport. Meanwhile, Rosie Rogers, senior political advisor at Greenpeace UK, said the UK still wasn't ""playing in the same league"" as other countries, such as Germany, which is investing â¬40bn (Â£36bn) in green jobs and energy efficiency, or France, which pledged â¬15bn to tackle the climate crisis in June. The UK Treasury said the figures are not like-for-like. Ahead of Wednesday's summer statement, former Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Sunak faced an extraordinarily complex challenge in reviving the economy. He said Mr Sunak would need to support viable businesses affected by shutdowns, but also help ""a transition"" for businesses that are no longer economically viable. ""Some businesses will close, some viable businesses will close units,"" he said. Mr Hammond added that ""the other great unknown"" is that ""we don't know what the trajectory of the disease itself is going to be"". He said the economy was likely to start to bounce back quickly as restrictions are lifted, but that would tail off, and some parts of the economy such as hospitality, aviation, and entertainment could take years to recover. Meanwhile Alison Brittain, chief executive of Premier Inn owner Whitbread, said it would be ""enormously helpful"" if Mr Sunak took action to support the hospitality sector on Wednesday. ""Anything about VAT relief for guests and customers would be great,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""Anything on rates relief, still, because the business rates holiday was enormously important for the sector and if we could extend that a bit longer, that would be equally helpful to us.""

"This video can not be played Jess Green from Lighthouse Kitchen: ""We could have opened today but chose not to as I think that's the right thing"" A number of pubs in England have shut after customers tested positive for coronavirus. At least three establishments announced they had shut their doors again just days after reopening at the weekend. They were among hundreds of venues that welcomed customers after three months as lockdown measures were eased - most apparently with no problem. But crowds descending in some towns and cities prompted fearssocial distancing was being disregarded. The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said it was ""slowly"" working through a list of customers,externalwho had left details at the weekend and that all staff had tested negative for the virus. This video can not be played The closures come after large crowds of people visited pubs across England, including London's Soho district In Batley, West Yorkshire, the Fox and Hounds said a customer had phoned tosay they had tested positive for coronavirus,external. Meanwhile the landlord of the Village Home Pub in Alverstoke, Hampshire, said his team were awaiting test results after someone in a member of staff's ""family bubble"" tested positive. What are the new rules for pubs? Jess Green, manager of the Lighthouse Kitchen, told BBC Points West she decided to close to ""put everyone's health and safety first"". ""I felt I had to keep my customers and my staff safe which is why I chose to shut the pub. I'm gutted, but safety comes first. ""We could have opened today but chose not to as I think that's the right thing to do."" The Fox and Hounds in Batley, West Yorkshire, said a customer phoned to say they had tested positive for coronavirus Saagar takeaway in Burnham will be closed until Friday Indian takeaway Saagar, also in Burnham, said itwould be closing until Friday to undergo a deep clean,externalafter one of its drivers had been to the Lighthouse Kitchen, along with bar the Vape Escape, which has also closed for a full clean after a customer's positive test. Leanne Underhill, owner of the Vape Escape, told burnham-on-sea.com,externalall staff tests had been negative and customers in the bar on Saturday have been contacted, in accordance with government advice. Somerset County Council said it was not treating the case as an ""outbreak"" and asked people to keep to social distancing guidelines and to regularly wash their hands. The Fox and Hounds said staff had taken tests and the venue would be deep-cleaned prior to reopening. The Batley pub said it had taken a number of measures ahead of Saturday's reopening, including limiting numbers allowed inside, a one-way system around the building and a one-in one-out policy on use of toilets. Georgia Gosling visited the Fox and Hounds over the weekend and said it had ""all the right procedures in place"" but called the news a ""wake-up call"". ""We were told to get a test and luckily everyone I know has come back negative,"" she said. Despite saying she was ""a bit scared to go out now"", Ms Gosling said she would return to the pub once it reopened. ""I've been going there for years and once they've done a deep clean it's not like it's contagious forever. I'll definitely will go back."" The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham said it was contacting customers Customers of the Village Home who had visited at the weekend,externalhave been told there was ""no need to isolate"" unless they showed symptoms or were contacted by tracers. Landlord Robby Roberts said: ""A member of staff, one of my barmaids, has someone in her family bubble who has tested positive."" He said she was on shift on Saturday when the pub was open for 11-and-a-half hours and about 150 customers visited. ""All five staff who were on shift on Saturday have now been tested and we are waiting for the results,"" he said. ""The pub is being deep cleaned and I have contacted the council.

"The news 4x4 Grenadier design was only revealed at the start of July Plans to build a new 4x4 vehicle plant in Wales have been put on hold by the firm Ineos. The company said it follows talks with Mercedes-Benz over the acquiring of their Hambach site in Moselle, France. The Wales plant would have been built next to the current Ford engine plant at Bridgend, which is to shut this autumn with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Economy Minister Ken Skates said it would be ""a real blow if Ineos reneged on its very public commitment"". ""I have told the CEO that abandoning Bridgend at this late stage, after so much effort and money has been invested in preparing the site, would be a terrible decision for Wales and the UK,"" said Mr Skates. ""We have impressed on the company in no uncertain terms the importance of honouring its commitment to Wales and to deliver on its promise to build a British icon here in Britain."" Almost no cars made during April lockdown Getting your car out of lockdown The Welsh Government added it had invested ""significant time and money"" and would look to recoup appropriate costs from the company if it pulled out. A UK government spokesman said: ""Today's news from Ineos is disappointing but we will continue to work alongside the Welsh Government to support the automotive industry in south Wales."" The new factory was expected to create about 200 jobs initially to make the new all-terrain Grenadier vehicle. It was hoped it could employ up to 500 people in the longer-term, and work to clear ground at the site had already begun. Work on another site in Portugal has also been suspended. Ineos had said the new Bridgend plant would eventually employ 500 people and produce 25,000 cars a year ""Some new options, such as this one with the plant in Hambach, have opened up that were simply not available to us previously,"" said Dirk Heilmann, the chief executive of Ineos Automotive. ""We are therefore having another look - and reviewing whether the addition of two new manufacturing facilities is the right thing to do in the current environment."" Mercedes-Benz put the Daimler car assembly plant in France up for sale last week. It was dedicated to its smart car, called the EQ fortwo, which has been recently developed. Ineos said it made the location ""ideally suited"" to the Grenadier. The company said Covid-19 had also had an impact on its building schedule for the new plants. ""Safety is of course paramount, but we also have an obligation to do what is right for the business - and so need to assess these new opportunities in order to maintain or improve on our timelines,"" said the Ineos Automotive chief. Elizabeth Davies, Leanne Rowlands and Steve Hone ""It's a shame because there's so many people out of work anyway,"" said Elizabeth Davies. ""It's sad because we're going to be in a bit of a mess."" Steve Hone said he was ""disappointed"" at Ineos's decision as its plans ""would have been good for the area"" with Ford closing its factory. ""We've seen a lot of places shut over the last 20 years with Sony closing and other factories on the estate, and Ford is the last big employer so Ineos was a chance for the future."" Leanne Rowlands said the town was ""struggling"". ""The shops are half empty, let alone the manufacturing businesses,"" she said. ""It's very sad."" BridgendMember of the SeneddCarwyn Jones, the former first minister of Wales, said: ""I don't accept for one minute that this had anything to do with covid. ""This is a decision that they don't want to invest in the UK - there's nothing more to it in my opinion,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru. ""I've heard a lot of things in politics over the years, but I've never seen this before, when a company say that they want to support the UK, but once the money's on the table, that's not what they do. ""I'm incredibly angry. There was an agreement and they've gone back on that."" This is a huge blow for Bridgend. It had been hoped that some of the workers losing their jobs at the nearby Ford plant could find work at Ineos. A lot of work also has gone into preparing suppliers to ensure the Welsh automotive industry benefited. The site is still being prepared for what would have been the Ineos plant. Work is continuing and there is some hope that it could be put to good use by attracting other companies to Bridgend. Even before this announcement there was interest from other businesses in moving to the area but those talks are at an early stage. It is unclear how much demand there has been for the Ineos Grenadier. Bridgend MP Jamie Wallis said he was ""disappointed"" by the announcement, and said it was a ""massive blow"" to the local economy and the economy of Wales. ""I have already spoken to the Wales Office and I am seeking urgent clarification about the implications of the future plant in Bridgend from Ineos and what more can be done from both governments at either end of the M4,"" he said. ""We need to do all we can to get the work back on track and secure this investment for workers and families in Bridgend."" A decision on where the new vehicle will be built will now be made ""in the next few weeks"" The leader of Bridgend council Huw David said the decision was ""disappointing"". ""The need for fresh investment into Bridgend county borough is now greater than ever, and we require urgent clarity not only over what Ineos intends to do, but on what action the Welsh government and the UK government will be taking in response to this latest development,"" he added. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones MS said: ""The fact that a site on mainland Europe appears to be favoured over a site in Wales may be a sign of what we risk, post-Brexit. ""It is very important that Welsh government seeks to understand the full picture from Ineos, engage with them and try to change their minds."" Ineos said it expected to complete its review of building options ""in the next few weeks"".

"Strawberries and cream, maybe even a glass of rosÃ©: the ""summer update"" has a whiff of end-of term festivities. But the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday may impact millions of livelihoods - and his own reputation. The grants, subsidies and loans deployed to shield the British economy from the shock of lockdown didn't manage to preserve all jobs. However, they ensured that lay-offs in the first couple of months of lockdown were in the thousands, rather than millions. The real test for Rishi Sunak starts now. As one of his predecessors remarked, everyone loves the chancellor when he's splashing the cash, and those schemes have cost tens of billions - in total he's staring at a Â£300bn deficit this year. With the furlough scheme set to be wound down, it's clear crippling job losses in some sectors are under way. This emergency mini-Budget on Wednesday will attempt to help minimise the pain as the economy convalesces by ""flattening the curve"" - this time of job losses - and to prevent the kind of lingering mass joblessness last seen when the chancellor was a toddler, that risks blighting millions of lives. Here are five areas to bear in mind - we already know some of what he'll look at, but there's more to come. At present, some economists say unemployment could triple to over four million this year. Rishi Sunak is expected to detail the beefing up of job centres, with more work coaches and advisers - underscoring that the government too is getting ready for an onslaught of losses. The rise in joblessness won't be fleeting; the first advisers won't be in place until October. There's more money for careers advice too, and work placements. Learning new skills will be vital - particularly for the youngest workers and lowest paid who've been particularly badly hit. Rishi Sunak has talked of preserving jobs where possible, and that may mean taking different approaches with different industries. A skilled workforce isn't enough; you need the demand for their talents - in other words, flourishing businesses. And some of those are suffering simply because they've not been able to open yet. Lyceum Theatre in London, home to the Lion King, was wrapped in messages of support last week in a campaign calling on the government to prevent the arts industry from collapse The struggling arts and heritage sectorhas been promised a Â£1.6bn bespoke package of loans and grants. That's a shift away from the Treasury's previous reluctance to provide tailored help - and may raise hopes elsewhere. But will those industries that don't have the glamour of showbiz, with high-profile spokespeople, be as lucky? The package for the arts sector may signal that the chancellor remains reluctant to extend the furlough scheme, even for struggling sectors. Some sectors - travel, for example - may fail to ever fully recover in the absence of a vaccine. Rather than prop them up, some argue it would be better to divert resources to supporting growing industries. Rishi Sunak is expected to earmark some cash to support green jobs and to promote environmentally friendly home improvements. Incentives for other ""new"" industries may also feature. Even the future of businesses who have reopened may not be secure, unless customers feel safe coming back, not just physically, but financially. Rishi Sunak has stopped short of a haircut photo opportunity, but he's set the tone with visits to shops, markets and even the pub, despite being teetotal. Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Rishi Sunak urged by MPs to extend self-employed help What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? And now he may be after our bank accounts. A record amount of money was stashed away in May as the majority of the population saw their incomes untroubled, but their spending reduced. An emergency short-term VAT cut of say, 2% or 3%, targeted at perhaps the hospitality industry may tempt us to part with some cash. A waiter serves drinks to diners in the Soho area of London on Saturday as pubs and bars reopened A similar cut was tried during the financial crisis but its impact was limited. Other ideas that have been touted include state-issued vouchers to spend on holidays, or changes to National Insurance contributions. All would bear a cost of billions. The next annual Budget is due in the autumn, which gives the chancellor time to mull over how the economy is progressing and introduce more measures, alongside the usual forecasts. We may, however, not have to wait that long for rumoured temporary changes to stamp duty. Some now expect that measure, which would boost the fortunes of homebuyers and housebuilders, to come up this Wednesday. At that Budget, we may hear more about how he will pay for all this. At present, the government is able to borrow cheaply via bonds on the financial markets, but there are limits. Mr Sunak may have to find other ways of footing the bill, such as pausing the ""triple lock"" formula used to calculate pension rises, for example. That won't be popular. Five months into the job, Mr Sunak is enjoying popularity ratings far in excess of that of his Cabinet colleagues, thanks to his handling of the economic crisis so far. Hanging on to that pole position over the challenging months - or even years - ahead will be no picnic. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"TikTok has said it will quit Hong Kong after China imposed a new security law on the city. ""In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The company's exit from the city will come ""within days,"" according to the Reuters news agency. Facebook and Twitter said this week they were ""pausing"" co-operation with Hong Kong police over user information. The short-form video app was launched by China-based ByteDance for users outside mainland China as part of a strategy to grow its global audience. The tech company operates a similar short video sharing app in China called Douyin. TikTok's Boogaloo extremism problem TikTok ban surprises India content makers TikTok, now run by former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app's user data is not stored in China. The company has also said previously that it would not comply with any Chinese government requests to censor content or give access to its users' data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. However, the controversial national security law in Hong Kong has given Chinese authorities sweeping new powers, raising concerns about data privacy. The legislation punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison. Critics say it erodes Hong Kong's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, including freedom of speech. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google and Telegram have all announced this week that they are also making changes to their operations in Hong Kong after the new security law came into force last week. The tech firms have said they are not processing data requests from the Hong Kong police while they assess the ongoing political changes in the city. TikTok's decision to stop operations in Hong Kong of its popular video app looks unusual - but is strategic. The company has struggled to fight off suspicions that it operates under Chinese law, or under the control of Beijing. Which is why TikTok has been at pains to try to change its global image - and this move could be one more step towards doing that. TikTok has also consistently said that if asked, it would never hand over data to Beijing - and that it's never been asked for any user data either. Staying in Hong Kong, under the new law, may make it difficult for it to keep to that commitment. Its biggest market is India - where it has recently been banned by the Indian government because of a border conflict with China. Analysts say it could potentially lose up to a billion dollars in lost advertising revenue in India. Which is why it is keen to show that it is not simply a Chinese-owned firm - but a global company that is also an international and responsible social media player. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the national security law imposed by Beijing saying it was not ""doom and gloom"" for the city. Ms Lam said the law would restore Hong Kong's status as one of the safest cities in the world after pro-democracy protests last year often turned violent. ""Compared with the national security laws of other countries, it is a rather mild law. Its scope is not as broad as that in other countries and even China,"" she said. The legislation has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997. Also on Tuesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the US is ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok. ""I don't want to get out in front of the President (Donald Trump), but it's something we're looking at,"" Mr Pompeo said. In response to Mr Pompeo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US. ""We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.""

" Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 In a small room, in a village on the outskirts of Wuhan, an elderly woman is chanting quietly and tapping out time on a table. Opposite her, another woman is crying softly. In early February, her 44-year-old brother died from coronavirus, and she cannot forgive herself. After the ceremony, Ms Wang - she doesn't want to use her full name - says that the shaman received a message from beyond the grave. Her brother, Wang Fei, had absolved her of any blame. “Feifei doesn't hold me responsible,” she says, referring to him by the name the family has used since childhood. “He was trying to comfort me and persuade me to accept his death.” Her brother died on a Covid ward, unable to see visitors; his last days lived out in a series of desperate text messages. “I feel so tired,” he wrote in one of them. “This disease has dragged on for too long.” Ms Wang’s guilt is a product of one of the cruellest aspects of this global pandemic – the enforced isolation of sufferers from their families. “I couldn’t go to the hospital to take care of him,” she tells me. “When I heard he’d died, I just couldn’t accept it. My family’s been broken into pieces.” She wants answers about her brother’s treatment - whether he was given proper care, and whether more could have been done to save him. But Ms Wang has been told by the police not to speak to the foreign media, and her choice to ignore that warning carries some risk. Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother One woman we arrange to interview arrives with plain-clothes policemen in pursuit. When she scrambles into our car, they block our way. We meet another man in the darkness on the banks of Wuhan’s East Lake. He tells us he’s been visited twice by the police for speaking out about the death of his father. For victims and journalists alike, asking questions about how and why the outbreak began in Wuhan, and whether it might have been better contained, is not easy. But at the epicentre of this global disaster, the need to ask questions is a necessity, not a choice. The day in mid-January when Wang Fei began to feel unwell, China's official death toll stood at just three. Today, more than 11 million people have been infected worldwide,at least 500,000 have died-  and the virus has forced the lockdown of entire economies. It is here where the virus was first discovered and the first attempts made to contain it. And it is here, too, where the search for its origin must begin, leading to perhaps the biggest question of them all, and one now at the heart of an escalating propaganda war between Washington and Beijing. Did the coronavirus  – as most scientists think – come from nature, or might it have leaked from a lab?  Ms Wang says her brother, who worked as a driver, hardly ever left Wuhan. Over the course of his 44 years, the central Chinese city grew from a declining industrial backwater into a booming international business and transport hub. But if Wang Fei’s life coincided with Wuhan’s extraordinary revival, then his final days ran in parallel with its descent into disaster. In early January, medics had begun to realise that the disease was highly infectious and wereimplementing their own hospital quarantine procedures. But instead of alerting the public, the authorities were silencing health workers. Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn colleagues to take precautions against infection, was reprimanded and made tosign a confession by the police. On the weekend of 18 January, with the authorities still insisting thedisease was not contagious, Wang Fei began to feel unwell. He went to hospital where he was given paracetamol for his fever and sent home. “They say there’s no human-to-human transmission, but the doctors are all wearing masks,” he told his sister. She can repeat the exact wording of the official reassurances, even now. “At that time, I was telling him that it is 'controllable and preventable,'” she says. “Only when I look back, I realise the government really didn't give enough warning. Now I know what he really needed was proper medical help. That’s what makes me feel guilty.” Mr Wang cancelled the family’s plans to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, which fell the following weekend. Instead he spent his days joining long queues outside hospitals. But with too many patients and not enough beds, he would return home exhausted. “He believed deeply that the country and government loved him,” Ms Wang says, “and that they would protect him.” On 23 January, Wuhan was put into lockdown. It was the world’s first, and became one of the longest and strictest attempts to contain the spread of the virus. But it came too late to prevent an estimated five million people leaving the city in the run-up to the national holiday. A few days later, his condition deteriorated and the family called for an ambulance. They were told there were more than 600 people ahead of them in the queue. Seven hours later he was finally admitted to hospital. Mr Wang found himself in a health system that was now totally overwhelmed. He texted his sister, complaining about the difficulty of getting staff to attend to his basic needs - such as help with drinking water. He continued to get worse. On 7 February Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor censored by the police, died in the same hospital. Mr Wang's spirits sank even lower. “If even a doctor can't survive,” he told his sister by text, “what chance have I got?” They are still silencing medics in Wuhan. Outside one hospital, we speak to a nurse who tells us about her experience on the front lines dealing with Covid-19 patients. Afterwards we exchange contact details and she cycles away. Two plain-clothes policemen, who have been watching us, emerge from the side of the street. They run alongside her with their hands on her handlebars, and bring her bike to a halt. I can see them speaking sternly to her, but by the time I catch up with them, they’ve let her go. She calls a few minutes later and asks us to delete the interview. For her safety we have no choice but to agree. The control of information, of course, has long been central to China’s system of government. In this case, it is central to the story. Wuhan’s lockdown was successful in eventually bringing the city’s outbreak under control, but China faces allegations,including from the US government, that delay and cover-up in the early stages made a global crisis inevitable. In the early stages of any disease outbreak, even days can make a big difference to the speed and scale of the spread. One studyhas suggested that if it had acted a week earlier, the number of cases in China could have been reduced by 66%. The authoritiesdeny the allegations. They insist that, in the face of a previously unknown disease, their response was swift and point out that it has been commended by theWorld Health Organization. The government is now comparing itself favourably to administrations in the West, even overtly mocking them for what it sees asa chaotic and confused response. And it is silencing those who mightchallenge that narrative. While the failings of democratic governments have been comprehensively exposed by a free press, there is no such scrutiny in China. This is a place where even trying to talk openly about your dead brother can bring you to the attention of the police. We put in requests to interview parliamentary delegates, senior health officials, academics and doctors - more than 20 people. None of our requests were granted. We sent questions to China’s health commission and its foreign and science ministries about the release of public information in the early days of the crisis. They went unanswered too. Wang Fei lived a short walk from a large market that became an early focus of the unfolding story. Despite its name, the Huanan Seafood Market is known to have had some trade in wild mammalssold there as delicacies. It is now closed. Initially, it was suspected to be ground zero for the outbreak, the place where the virusmade the leap from animals to humans. Sars-CoV-2 – as it has now been named - belongs to a family of coronaviruses named for their spikey or crown-like surfaces. A vast number of these viruses have been shown to becarried by bats. Some of them are thought to have the potential to infect humans, either when passeddirectly from a bat, or after first infecting another animal species – an intermediate host – that then comes intocontact with people. This is,one theory suggests, what triggered another coronavirus outbreak in China which first appeared in November 2002. The Sars coronavirus, now known as Sars CoV-1, is thought to have jumped from bats to humans via the civet cat - a small furry mammal sold in the markets of southern China. After the authorities failed to acknowledge the outbreak for several months, Sars went on to cause 774 deaths worldwide. Nearly two decades later, the very first cluster of Sars CoV-2 cases appeared in Mr Wang’s Wuhan neighbourhood. One study foundaround half of themhad a connection to the seafood market. It was no surprise then that there was widespread speculation the virus’s intermediate host might have been among theanimals on sale there. But this theory now appears to have beendismissed by China, following the testing of samples taken from various places inside the market. While traces of the virus were found, none were detected on any of the animal samples. Officials have concluded that the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. Most scientists remain convinced, though, that somewhere along the line, whether in a market or elsewhere, Sars-CoV-2 will have passed naturally froman animal to a human. They point to an increasing number ofsuch “spillover” eventsdriven by factors such as population growth and human encroachmenton natural habitats. Dr Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from Hong Kong University who joined the Chinese National Health Commission fact-finding trip to Wuhan in January, says the “spillover” theory is the most favoured for the origin of this virus. This is not least, he says, because such events have happened so often before, from Sars CoV-1 to other avian-flu pandemics. “H5N1 was the first wake-up, then Sars, then H7N9 in the Yangtze Delta, and now Sars-CoV-2,” he tells me. “So, if you ask me what is the highest possibility – it’s that the virus is coming out from markets, markets that are selling wildlife.” And that’s why, he argues, the trade in wild animals should remain the focus of prevention efforts. “It is not easy to change culture, but we must,” he says. Finding the source of the virus is not just a question of academic interest. If Sars-CoV-2 has come from a reservoir of infection in a particular animal species, then of course, it could continue to pose the risk of new outbreaks. In mid-May, the World Health Organization passed a resolution calling for an international effort to trace the likely intermediate animal host. It has just announced it has been given permission to send ateam of investigators to China for this purpose. But scientists agree it maynot be an easy task. We sent a number of questions to the Chinese National Health Commission and the foreign and science ministries about the work already being done in this regard. We asked if any studies had begun to test various animal species that could have spread the virus. We received no answers to our questions. Outside the shuttered Huanan Seafood Market we’re stopped from filming. “I don’t care where you’re from,” a policeman tells me when I explain that I’m a foreign journalist. “China has done a lot to contain the virus. You need to promote positive energy.” As Wang Fei lay dying in hospital, another location in Wuhan, a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood Market, was already becoming the focus of an altogether different theory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was now at the centre of a growing storm of conspiracy theories, suspicions and allegations that the virus might have leaked from a lab. They have continued to this day. The WIV’s modernist, grey concrete and glass structure, set in a leafy campus with a small lake, is clearly visible from the adjacent road. When we arrive there, we are quickly surrounded by security guards who tell us it’s a sensitive area and call the police. The institute is the world’s leading authority in the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. Its researchers are led by star scientist Professor Shi Zhengli – known as “Bat Woman” to her colleagues because of her expertise. They have spent years collecting samples from live bats in remote Chinese caves. Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab One recent paper, co-authored by Professor Shi, gives details about hundreds of bat coronaviruses, many of them previously unpublished, unveiling justhow many have been gathered. The research has included the genetic modification of some of these viruses, including the construction of new, chimeric – or hybrid – viruses, in order to examine their potential to infect humans and, potentially, cause pandemics. It was Professor Shi who discovered and sequenced the genetic code of the nearest known relative of theSars CoV-1 virus, found inside a bat from a cave in China's Yunnan Province. Ever since the Sars CoV-1 outbreak, the fear of an even deadlier, more infectious spillover event has been the driving force behind Wuhan's coronavirus research. On 2 January, just three days after becoming aware of the new virus circulating in Wuhan, she also became the first tosequence Sars-Cov-2. Ironically, it is the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 that has itself helped fuel the lab-leak theory. Some subsequent studies, includingone by Prof Shi, suggest that there is something different about its genome compared to other known coronaviruses of a similar type. Its spike proteins – the pointy bits of the “crown” that latch onto the cells of an infected host – seem to bind extremely well to human cells. While most viruses need time to adapt to a new host, Sars-CoV-2 appears to have been highly infectious from the beginning of the outbreak. One papercompared the new outbreak with the original Sars epidemic. It found that Sars-CoV-2 was already “pre-adapted” for human infection. The virus’ spike proteins also have a feature, unusual in Sars-type coronaviruses, known as a “furin cleavage site”. These arethought likelyto increase the efficiency with which the virus can penetrate the human cells, take them over and replicate inside them. It is this combination of factors – the WIV’s proximity to the outbreak, the kind of scientific work it was involved in, and the seemingly unusual nature of the virus itself – that have led to the highly controversial alternative to the natural “spillover” theory. Claims that the virus leaked from a lab first began to circulate on the Chinese internet in early February. There were unsubstantiated rumours the coronavirus may have passed from a lab-infected animal tothe local community, or that one of the WIV researchers may have themselvesbecome accidentally infected,  either with a natural virus collected from the wild, or a lab-made one. Conspiracy theories soon spread further afield, including claims in some foreign newspapers and websites that the virus may have beenan engineered “bio-weapon”. But none of the lab leak theories – animal virus, man-made virus, deliberate or accidental – have been backed up with any concrete proof, relying instead on conjecture and circumstantial evidence. A group of Indian researchers were some of the first to use the virus’ genome to hint at the possibility ofgenetic modification in a lab. But the paper was quicklydebunked and was withdrawn. However unusual the virus appeared to be, there was nothing to prove that its notable features could not have come directly from nature. In early February, Shi Zhengli herself took to social media in response. “I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote, adding that those who spread rumours should“shut their stinking mouths”. Meanwhile, Mr Wang was succumbing to some of the same notable qualities of the virus on which such theories were partly based. It was a pattern of decline now all too familiar to medics everywhere. His lungs were being ravaged by the pathogen, filling with fluid and white blood cells, and the oxygen in his blood was plummeting. “My heartbeat rate is 160 per min. My blood oxygen saturation is only 70. It’s killing me,” he texted his sister. The following day, on 8 February, he sent one last message. “Please save me,” it read, “I can see stars.” He died a few hours later.  On 30 April, the US president waded into the controversy. He was asked by a reporter: “Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?” “Yes, I have. Yes, I have,”Donald Trump replied. Other administration officials have weighed in, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming what he claimed was China’s“history of running sub-standard laboratories”. But despite the US saying to have “enormous evidence” for a lab leak, none has been provided. With the theory now central to an escalating geopolitical dispute between the US and China, critics of President Trump’s handling of the response at home see it as a sensationalist smokescreen todeflect domestic blame. Mindful that they could be drawn into a quagmire of conspiracy and propaganda, some scientists, however, believe that the lab leak question should not be dismissed out-of-hand. It relates, they say, to one of the major scientific debates of our time and it has implications not just for China but for the US government too. The work of the WIV, in collecting large numbers of bat coronaviruses and experimenting on them, has not been a lone venture. It has been part of a majorinternational effortfocused on the growing risk of spillover events and the threat of new, human pandemics. Some of Wuhan’s research has involved collaborations withUS scientistsand the backing of generous amounts ofUS funding. And its creation of chimeric viruses - the stitching together of parts of the genomes of different viruses to make new ones - uses an easily accessible technique commonplace in labs around the world. Such research has  been the subject of an intense disagreement between scientists about the benefits andrisks of such research. Supporters say it can help us to anticipate how viruses might emerge in the wild and has the potential to help with the development of medicines and vaccines. Those against, say it risks doing the exact opposite. Manipulating viruses – to make them more infectious or more deadly – could, they say, spark off a man-made pandemic with a lab-made virus. The risks might include lab workers becoming infected – perhaps unknowingly – when collecting virus samples from animals in the field, when handling animals kept in the lab, or when experimenting with live viruses. Since the Sars CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, for example, there have been four separate leaks from labs studying that disease. Two of the incidents were at the National Institute of Virology inBeijing in 2004. During one of them, a researcher caught Sars after spending two weeks at the lab. She went on to infect her mother, who died, as well as a nurse, who in turn infected several other people. The coincidence of a new pandemic coronavirus appearing in the same city as a laboratory devoted to studying them is something that Prof Shi Zhengli appeared to initially acknowledge. When she learned of the outbreak at the end of December, her thoughts turned to the viruses stored in the institute's freezers. In an interview with Scientific American, she says she remembers thinking that if coronaviruses had sparked the pandemic:“Could they have come from our lab?” While the lab leak theory has smouldered away both online and in Washington political circles, it has largely beendismissed by scientists. It is a scientific consensus that has, in turn, fed into mainstream media coverage, with now wide acceptance that a natural, spillover event is the most probablecause of Sars-CoV-2. The dismissal is based not just on the fact that such spillovers have happened before, but on a key piece of evidence that has come from Prof Shi Zhengli herself. Concerned to rule out her lab’s involvement in the outbreak, according to the Scientific American interview, she began “frantically” searching the experimental records and samples already stored in her lab. HerFebruary paperreported what she said was the closest match she was able to find. A virus, which she named RaTG13, collected from a bat in 2013, showed a 96.2% similarity to Sars-CoV-2. Although that sounds close, the 3.8% genetic difference between the two would, estimates suggest, take decades of evolutionary change tooccur in nature. If Sars-CoV-2 had leaked from her collection of coronaviruses, the lab would have contained either Sars-CoV-2 itself, or something much, much closer related. “That really took a load off my mind,” Prof Shi told Scientific American. “I had not slept a wink for days.” But the evidence that has undoubtedly had the most bearing on the discussion about a possible lab leak was contained in a paper published in March in the medical journal,Nature Medicine. It has become widely accepted as proof that the virus was not made in a lab. The unusual features of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein discussed earlier – its high binding affinity to human cells and its furin cleavage site – must have, the authors argue, come from nature. Their evidence is partly based on the use of sophisticated computer modelling. If a scientist had used such models in advance, they argue, to analyse how strongly the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein might bind to human cells, the results would predict a far weaker bond than actually turns out to be the case. In other words, a computer would be unable to foresee the binding strength of the virus. Therefore, they argue, no scientist is likely to have set out to create it in a lab. Furthermore, they imply, to create Sars-CoV-2 in a lab, you’d need to start with a virus with a much closer genetic match than RaTG13, the distant ancestor found in the Wuhan freezer. A new virus cannot be made from a virus that does not exist. Far more likely, they say, that the virus picked up its notable features while circulating, undetected, in humans or animals for months or years before the outbreak. “We very carefully considered a potential link to the lab - we did not dismiss this possibility out of hand,” the paper’s lead author Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US tells me. “And it is clear - all the available data is fully consistent with a natural history of Sars-CoV-2. There is no scientific data showing any link to the lab. “Most theories considering a link to the lab are conspiracy theories,” he adds. “They are exceptionally disruptive to the efforts of getting Covid-19 under control and result in unnecessary human suffering.” Despite the wide acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Nature Medicine Paper, there are stillsome scientistswho refuse to see it as conclusive proof that the virus wasn’t manipulated in some way. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide and Chairman and Research Director of Vaxine, a company leading Australia's search for a Covid-19 vaccine, believes that laboratory manipulation has to remain under consideration for being behind a possible explanation for Sars-CoV-2’s“surprising”ability to bind to human cells. And he rejects the argument that if it wasn’t pre-planned by a computer model, it didn’t happen. “In science a lot of things are done on the basis of give-it-a-go, and a lot of things happen completely by accident,” he tells me. “You know, a lot of Nobel prizes have been won on the basis of accidents.” Others referto Wuhan’spast experimentsin which genome segments from different viruses have been stitched together to investigate how spike proteins bind to human cells. And they point out that there is no way of knowing whether or not Wuhan does in fact have, among the hundreds of coronaviruses it has collected, anything closer in genetic make-up to Sars-CoV-2 than RaTG13. What’s more, RaTG13 is itself the subject of some speculation. The BBC has had it confirmed, from the researchers running a respectedChinese database, that it is the same virus as one that the WIV previously referred to as RaBatCov/4991inthis paper. There is no explanation for the change of name, but that 2016 paper makes it clear that the virus appears to be a new strain of Sars-type coronavirus. Professor Petrovsky says it would be odd if the WIV, given its interest in such viruses, hadn’t continued to work on it. But there is no more mention of it at all until this year, when RaBatCov/4991 re-emerged under its new name RaTG13 as the closest known relative of Sars-CoV-2. Professor Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University in the US, says there is only one way to conclusively rule out any form of a lab leak. “A credible investigation would need unrestricted access by investigators to facilities, samples, records, and personnel, as well as unrestricted environmental sampling of facilities and serological sampling of personnel,” he tells me. The US government said in a statement in April that the intelligence community does not believe the virus was modified or created, but the government continues “to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of anaccident at a laboratory in Wuhan”. We put in a request to speak to Professor Shi Zhengli but it was turned down. We sent questions to the WIV asking whether any investigation had been carried out and, if not, whether they’d be willing to allow one. Again, there was no response. Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days. Afraid that she might be infected, Ms Wang was too worried to join her mother at home, so stuck it out in the office, surviving on simple meals. She was joined by her brother’s 13-year-old daughter, while his widow, also infected with coronavirus, recovered in hospital. “I kept writing down memories of my brother,” Ms Wang tells me, “and then posted them on social media in order to ease my empty feelings and hopelessness.” After the lockdown was lifted on 8 April she emerged into a city that had, through an extraordinary collective effort and the forced ordeal of lockdown, vanquished the virus. Today, Wuhan is returning to life. But the signs of the lingering economic impact can still be seen. In one of the usually vibrant night-markets people are eating and socialising again, but many of the tables are empty. “Customer numbers are down by two-thirds,” one woman selling boiled frogs tells me. There are signs of something else here too. Early in the lockdown, in the chaos and confusion of that moment, the censorship controls appeared to briefly vanish. People vented their anger on social media about the perceived official failings, and their grief, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang. Today though, a different narrative has taken hold. “China united together to prevent the epidemic,” says another trader, selling yellow-croaker fish on sticks. “But you foreigners don’t know how to protect yourselves.” And the market customers appear to have absorbed yet another origin theory which has been promoted by Chinese state media andsome senior officials. “I think the virus came from the US,” one woman tells me. “In the early stage of the outbreak, US soldiers were visiting Wuhan. They left early in a chartered plane.” In the absence of independent evidence, politics and propaganda are filling the vacuum with both the US and China continuing to trade unsubstantiated allegations. And without it, it is impossible to answer the big questions. How might a spillover event be better contained next time? And how do we properly balance the benefits of the study of pandemic viruses, in a growing number ofvirology labs, against the risks? Scientists who support such work are convinced that Sars-CoV-2 is an incentive to redouble their efforts. “The mission must go on,” Professor Shi Zhengli says, with a plan to sample bat viruses on a much bigger scale. Something Professor Richard Ebright, from Rutgers, calls the“definition of insanity”. China has, under some diplomatic pressure, agreed to anindependent investigationinto the international response to the virus, although it is unclear what the remit will be, who will take part, and when it might happen. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it will have to wait until thepandemic is over. Meanwhile Ms Wang says she intends to continue to fight for answers about her brother’s death. She insists the warnings from the police to keep quiet won’t stop her. “I’m a law abiding citizen,” she says. She does not want us to publish her full name simply to minimise the risk of online abuse, not because she is trying to hide from the authorities. Sometimes it is in the individual stories that the true, global impact of the virus really hits home. Four months after Wang Fei died, Ms Wang has only just told her mother what really happened. The family, fearing she would be unable to bear the news, allowed her to believe her son was still in quarantine. In the end, they could hide it no longer. “For several days my mum couldn’t fall asleep,” Ms Wang tells me. “A woman born before the founding of our country can’t understand why such a tragedy can happen in modern times.”   ",Negative,3.680477e-06

"Michelle Geraghty-Carns says she must be able to reopen if she is to save her business Spas and firms offering complementary therapies such as massage, detox and hydrotherapy have told the BBC they could go out of business soon if they cannot reopen in July. ""I can sustain my business for another two weeks, and that's it,"" says Michelle Geraghty-Carns, owner of complementary therapy clinic EternalBeing and spa firm EternalSpa in Enderby, Leicestershire. Entrepreneurs in the industry were already struggling with a slump in demand, having had to shut their businesses due to coronavirus restrictions. But when spas and firms offering complementary therapies were not included ona long list of businesses allowed to reopen from 4 July, some felt dismay. Ms Geraghty-Carns, who has been in business for 20 years, last week made the difficult decision to shut her spa down because she could no longer afford the lease on the premises. Her clinic, which offers a range of treatments for allergies, intolerances and deficiencies, is in better shape, but only just. Like others in the complementary therapy sector, Ms Geraghty-Carns is ""frustrated and annoyed"" that the government is permitting hairdressers, pubs and restaurants in England to reopen, but not businesses like her own. It considers spas and firms offering complementary therapies to be""close contact"" - and therefore riskier - services,external, but she feels they are no less safe. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said it wanted businesses to reopen ""as soon as possible"" but in a ""Covid-secure way"". Ms Geraghty-Carns has invested heavily in personal protective equipment Although she is certified by several national complementary therapy governing bodies, Ms Geraghty-Carns' work is not officially classed as healthcare, so it falls into a grey area and is often mistaken as being part of the beauty industry. ""No one's using any common sense when looking at separate businesses,"" she says. ""You speak to your insurer, or the local council, and we're told we've got to wait until the government gives us the sign-off."" Adding to her woes, Ms Geraghty-Carns recently refurbished her clinic and spa and invested heavily in personal protective equipment (PPE), having expected she would be able to reopen. ""That cost Â£38,000 and we've had to get a bank loan to pay for it. And I just picked up the latest in American hydrotherapy equipment last week that costs Â£20,000,"" she says. Professional massage therapists in the UK are facing a similar challenge, but they also have to contend with negative connotations wrongly attributed to their occupation. Massage therapist Anneli Hukins is not allowed to treat clients who have been suffering from pain through lockdown ""I think the government's phrasing of 'massage parlour' is hugely disturbing. I don't know what kind of parlours politicians frequent, but my work is in pain management,"" says Anneli Hukins, a former nurse and self-employed mobile massage therapist in Kent, who owns health business Woodstock Holistics. ""I'm furious that having spent so much of my life studying to treat people who are sick or injured I'm being told to stay at home, when hairdressers can go to work, and hairdressing is not an essential part of health and wellbeing."" Coronavirus: Lockdown to be relaxed in England as 2m rule eased Coronavirus: We're taking pandemic seriously, says beauty firm Hairdresser: 'We've built a waiting list of over 2,000 people' Ms Hukins, a fellow of the Complementary Medical Association (CMA), is currently writing a paper on why massage therapy should be reclassified as being on par with other physical therapies such as physiotherapy and osteopathy. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has found that massage can help conditions such as sciatica and lower back pain as an alternative to medication, but the NHS is not currently offering this therapy. Retired nurse Gillian Tomkins, 70, suffers from constant hip and shoulder pain Gillian Tomkins, 70, from Northiam, East Sussex, is a retired nurse who suffers from osteoarthritis. It is incurable - a side effect from being on her feet for most of her career. ""I've had one hip replacement. The other hip is no good and my shoulders are no good,"" she says. ""I'm in constant pain and I'm taking more pain medication than I was before lockdown began."" Ms Tomkins says she misses her massage therapist and is ""desperate"" for relief, as her medication only goes so far. ""I only see my therapist once every other week and it's amazing, it keeps you going."" Aly Thobani is the owner and director of Spa and Massage, a chain of five massage therapy clinics in London that started in 2007. Aly Thobani is worried about the future of his business He employs healthcare professionals, physiotherapists and massage therapists, all of whom are certified. ""I am worried about the future of my business. The prolonged closure runs up more costs and we're already in a very precarious position,"" he says. ""We've got hundreds of emails from clients enquiring whether we can send therapists to their homes, but mobile massage therapy is not allowed either."" Before the pandemic, the business was doing 1,000 massages a week. Like many in the wellbeing industry, Mr Thobani had expected that if hairdressers could open, so could other services providing hands-on therapies. He is very upset by the government's recent announcement: ""What Boris Johnson said about massage parlours is insulting and discriminatory, because a massage parlour has a connotation of something sexual. ""But massage therapy clinics are a mainstream business - people are coming to get something fixed. ""During treatment, the client lies face down. We have air-ventilated rooms, the client can wear masks, we can wear masks. We can check temperatures and we have an appointment-only service."" Massage therapists already have to sanitise treatment rooms after each client Mr Thobani is worried because landlords are chasing rent on his five premises, and from 30 September onwards they will be able to take legal action against those who can't pay. It means Spa and Massage needs to find the money to pay for around four months of rent covering lockdown, its PPE costs, and the salaries of staff when they come back to work. But revenues are likely to be 50% lower than usual even if the firm can reopen, Mr Thobani says, because it will not be able to see as many clients as it could prior to lockdown. ""We need to see the government allow massage therapy clinics to open urgently and change the classification of such businesses to be medical professionals,"" he says. ""My life savings are in this, years of work, and all of our contractors are also sitting at home. ""They're all really passionate about their work - this is what they do, they fix people. It's their livelihood and they have no idea when they will be able to work again."" A Beis spokesman said: ""We want to reopen closed businesses as soon as possible, once we're confident they are able to operate in a Covid-secure way. ""This is particularly important for close contact services such as massage therapists, which can often pose a greater risk of transmission due to prolonged periods of close contact. ""Businesses can continue to access our extensive package of financial support to help them through this difficult period."" We're taking coronavirus seriously, says beauty firm 'There isn't time.

Boddell's in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, shut its doors at 21:00 BST on Saturday after learning there were ""a number of people around the town centre who had been drinking all day"". Bosses said the decision was a ""proactive rather than reactive measure"" and no customers were asked to leave for not following rules. In a poston the venue's Facebook page,external, they said: ""Understanding that it will take some time for people to become fully accustomed to the 'new normal' of pubs, especially after a few drinks, we have subsequently taken the decision to close earlier on weekends for the time being.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the prime minister was ""certainly not blaming care homes"" for social care coronavirus deaths in comments made on Monday. Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying""too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures""during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sharma said: ""Specifically on the point the prime minister was making yesterday, I think what he was actually pointing out is that nobody knew what the correct procedures were at the time because, quite frankly, we didn't know what the extent of asymptomatic transmission was. ""We then put in place very detailed action plans for care homes, we made sure there was a rigorous testing regime put in place, and we also ensured there was extra money - there was Â£600m that went in as part of an infection control fund."" The level of litter and fly-tipping in woodlands during lockdown is harming the countryside and putting nature at risk, a charity has warned.

"Traffic has almost disappeared in many cities around the world, such as LA (pictured) We're living through the biggest carbon crash ever recorded. No war, no recession, no previous pandemic has had such a dramatic impact on emissions of CO2 over the past century as Covid-19 has in a few short months. Multiple sources indicate we are now living through an unrivalled drop in carbon output. But even though we will see a massive fall this year, the concentrations of CO2 that are in the atmosphere and warming our planet won't stabilise until the world reaches net-zero. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red' As our chart shows, since the Spanish flu killed millions over 100 years ago, the global expansion of emissions of CO2, from the use of oil, gas and coal has risen massively. While these energy sources have transformed the world, the carbon seeping into our atmosphere has driven up global temperatures by just over 1C since the mid-1850s. They could rise by 3-4C by the end of this century if CO2 levels aren't savagely reduced. Over the past 100 years, as indicated on the graphic, a number of events have shown that dramatic falls in carbon are possible. Much is made of the financial crash in 2008-2009, but in reality, carbon emissions only fell by around 450 million tonnes between 2008 and 2009. This is much smaller than the fall in CO2 in the aftermath of World War II, which saw a drop of around 800 million tonnes. This video can not be played Coronavirus and climate change a ""double crisis"", say activists It is also smaller than the global recession in the early 1980s that followed the oil crisis of the late 1970s. During this period, CO2 went down by around one billion tonnes. But the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 dwarves all of these previous shocks by some distance. In a few months, demand for energy globally has fallen off a cliff. The International Energy Agency (IEA)says that the world will use 6% less this year,external- equivalent to losing the entire energy demand of India. This will feed through to large falls in CO2. A number of different analyses,including this one from Carbon Brief,external, show that emissions this year will fall by 4-8%, somewhere between 2 and 3 billion tonnes of the warming gas. That's between six and ten times larger than during the last global recession. By air and on roads, the world has cut back heavily on travel. Full lockdowns have also pushed global electricity demand down by 20% or more, says the IEA. Across the full year, the need for electricity will fall by 5% - the biggest drop since the Great Depression of the 1930s. ""This is an historic shock to the entire energy world,"" says Dr Fatih Birol, IEA executive director. The changes in energy demand will have a knock-on effect on global coal demand, which is set to fall 8% this year. With China the first country to stall its economy in response to the virus, coal use dropped sharply at first, though it is now rebounding and the expectation among energy analysts is that production this year will be down by just over 1%. Researchers say the biggest thing hitting CO2 emissions right now is the reduction in road transport. Air travel has fallen by half in the US According to the IEA global average road transport activity fell to 50% of the 2019 level by the end of March 2020. As can be seen in our chart, almost every country has seen a huge drop in road use. This has resulted in a massive fall in the use of oil. ""Back in the 2009 recession, average oil demand dropped by 1.3 million barrels per day versus 2008. And now 2020 is set to average 10 million barrels per day less than 2019."" said Erik Holm Reiso, from Rystad Energy, an independent research firm. ""It's a much more severe cycle."" Similarly, air travel has dropped hugely, but by different amounts in different regions. In Europe, the number of flights is down around 90%, whereas in the US it has been more resilient with around half the number of planes taking off compared to last year. Globally, though, the demand for jet fuel is down 65% year-on-year to April. ""What we're seeing is that the largest relative reduction is in air traffic,"" said Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (Cicero). ""But air emissions are only about 3% of global total. So while the relative reductions in land transport are lower than air transport, the absolute reductions there are much more significant."" A really simple guide to climate change Climate change: Where we are in seven charts While the lockdown might feel rather uniform across the world, there have been huge variations in emissions reductions from different cities. If we take Paris and New York as examples, the contrast, as shown on our chart, is huge. Paris saw a CO2 drop of 72% (+/-15%) in the month of March compared to normal. New York in the same period, saw a CO2 fall of around 10%. Paris has seen a dramatic fall in CO2 since the lockdown began So why the big difference? ""In the Paris area, there are no large fossil fuel power plants, or industrial sites,"" said Philippe Ciais, from the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace in Paris. ""Another difference is whether buildings are heated with fuels or with electricity. In France, around 70% of electricity comes from nuclear."" Much of New York's CO2 comes from emissions related to the heating of buildings. But significant emissions come from fossil fuel plants based within the city limits. Cars make up a much smaller proportion of overall energy use. ""I guess something to think about is that we shut down the entire city and got a reduction of 10% in the CO2 emissions,"" said Prof RÃ³isÃ­n Commane from Columbia University in New York. ""We are still emitting more than 80% of our previous CO2 emissions. That is a massive number. So personal behaviour really isn't going to fix the carbon emission problem. We need a systematic change in how energy is generated and transmitted."" This video can not be played What is climate change? Back in 2008, the European electricity industry was hit badly by the global financial recession and demand for power fell sharply. But when that demand picked up again, it was solar and wind that were by then large enough to supply all the growth. Europe's use of fossil fuels to produce electricity never returned to the level it had been at before the crash. Experts now believe something similar could happen with the coronavirus pandemic. ""In about half of the world, we've already seen peak demand for fossil fuels,"" said Kingsmill Bond, from independent financial think tank Carbon Tracker. Air pollution has cleared in some parts of Nepal due to restrictions there ""In Europe it was 2005, in the USA 2007."" This means that the trend in demand has been downhill ever since. He added: ""There has been a global coal demand peak in 2013. If you look at car demand, it is increasingly accepted that you saw peak conventional car demand in 2017."" So will the pandemic's big hit on carbon mean that last year, 2019, becomes the year the world reached a turning point? Not so fast. The carbon emissions drop that followed the recession in 2009was followed by a sharp rise,externalof almost 6% in 2010. Something similar could happen over the next couple of years. ""At this point, we do not see any clear signs that the pandemic and our societal response to it will lead to significant and permanent changes in the path of future global emissions,"" said Robbie Andrew from Cicero. ""Right at the moment what we're seeing are immediate emissions responses, and following most previous crises, global emissions have returned to their pre-crisis trajectory."" The oil industry has ground to a halt as demand has slumped To keep the world on track to stay under 1.5C this century, the world needs similar cuts for the foreseeable future to keep this target in view. ""If Covid-19 leads to a drop in emissions of around 5% in 2020, then that is the sort of reduction we need every year until net-zero emissions are reached around 2050,"" said Glen Peters, also from Cicero. ""Such emissions reductions will not happen via lockdowns and restrictions, but by climate policies that lead to the deployment of clean technologies and reductions in demand for energy."" Energy experts believe there will be a bounce back next year, but that, long term, the world will move to greener fuels. But it may not be enough to keep temperatures down to safer levels. ""That downward slope will accelerate over time beyond peak fossil energy,"" said Erik Holm Reiso, from Rystad Energy. ""That doesn't chime with 1.5C, but maybe 1.8-1.9C degrees could be within reach and this situation right now could help achieve that, I think."" Lessons learnt? Many climate researchers are optimistic that this deadly pandemic has taught governments some critical lessons that they can apply to the problem of rising temperatures. The big challenge is to ensure the recovery has a green focus. According to Prof Gail Whiteman from Lancaster University, UK, it was almost impossible to believe that governments around the world, when faced with a health emergency, would put humanity ahead of the economy. But they did. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"TikTok has said it will quit Hong Kong after China imposed a new security law on the city. ""In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The company's exit from the city will come ""within days,"" according to the Reuters news agency. Facebook and Twitter said this week they were ""pausing"" co-operation with Hong Kong police over user information. The short-form video app was launched by China-based ByteDance for users outside mainland China as part of a strategy to grow its global audience. The tech company operates a similar short video sharing app in China called Douyin. TikTok's Boogaloo extremism problem TikTok ban surprises India content makers TikTok, now run by former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app's user data is not stored in China. The company has also said previously that it would not comply with any Chinese government requests to censor content or give access to its users' data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. However, the controversial national security law in Hong Kong has given Chinese authorities sweeping new powers, raising concerns about data privacy. The legislation punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison. Critics say it erodes Hong Kong's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, including freedom of speech. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google and Telegram have all announced this week that they are also making changes to their operations in Hong Kong after the new security law came into force last week. The tech firms have said they are not processing data requests from the Hong Kong police while they assess the ongoing political changes in the city. TikTok's decision to stop operations in Hong Kong of its popular video app looks unusual - but is strategic. The company has struggled to fight off suspicions that it operates under Chinese law, or under the control of Beijing. Which is why TikTok has been at pains to try to change its global image - and this move could be one more step towards doing that. TikTok has also consistently said that if asked, it would never hand over data to Beijing - and that it's never been asked for any user data either. Staying in Hong Kong, under the new law, may make it difficult for it to keep to that commitment. Its biggest market is India - where it has recently been banned by the Indian government because of a border conflict with China. Analysts say it could potentially lose up to a billion dollars in lost advertising revenue in India. Which is why it is keen to show that it is not simply a Chinese-owned firm - but a global company that is also an international and responsible social media player. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the national security law imposed by Beijing saying it was not ""doom and gloom"" for the city. Ms Lam said the law would restore Hong Kong's status as one of the safest cities in the world after pro-democracy protests last year often turned violent. ""Compared with the national security laws of other countries, it is a rather mild law. Its scope is not as broad as that in other countries and even China,"" she said. The legislation has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997. Also on Tuesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the US is ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok. ""I don't want to get out in front of the President (Donald Trump), but it's something we're looking at,"" Mr Pompeo said. In response to Mr Pompeo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US. ""We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.""

"Hundreds of thousands of homeowners will receive vouchers of up to Â£5,000 for energy-saving home improvements, with the poorest getting up to Â£10,000. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out a Â£2bn grant scheme in England for projects such as insulation as part of a wider Â£3bn plan to cut emissions. The Treasury said the grants could help to support more than 100,000 jobs. Labour said renters appeared to be left out and called for a ""broader and bigger"" plan to cut carbon emissions. It comes ahead of a summer statement from Mr Sunak on Wednesday, in which he could announce changes to stamp duty and VAT. Business leaders and a former chancellor have called for radical action to bolster the economy, which is still reeling from the impact of coronavirus. Under the Green Homes Grant, the government will pay at least two-thirds of the cost of home improvements that save energy, the Treasury said. For example, a homeowner of a semi-detached or end-of-terrace house could install cavity wall and floor insulation for about Â£4,000 - the homeowner would pay Â£1,320 while the government would contribute Â£2,680. Coronavirus: UK warned to avoid climate change crisis Coronavirus: Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Coronavirus recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' The scheme will launch in September, with online applications for recommended energy efficiency measures, along with details of accredited local suppliers. Once one of these suppliers has provided a quote and the work is approved, the voucher is issued. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Business Secretary Alok Sharma added that the poorest households could receive up to Â£10,000 towards costs, and that double glazing would also be covered by the scheme. He continued: ""What [the scheme] ultimately means is lower bills for households, hundreds of pounds off energy bills every year, it's supporting jobs and is very good news for the environment."" The chancellor is rumoured to be planning changes to stamp duty to help the housing market The government said about half of the fund - which is due to be spent in one financial year - will go to the poorest homeowners, who will not have to contribute anything to the cost. Better insulation could save some people Â£600 a year on energy bills, the Treasury said. Mr Sunak said the investment would also help to ""kick-start our economy"" by creating thousands of jobs and providing business for existing skilled workers, as the UK recovers from the economic shock of coronavirus. ""As Britain recovers from the outbreak, it's vital we do everything in our power to support and protect livelihoods across the nation,"" he said. The governmentwill pledge to provide 30,000 new traineeshipsto get young people in England into work, giving firms Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer According to reports, there could be a short-term VAT cut for the ailing hospitality industry to help lift demand However, the Observer reported that plans to give all adults Â£500 and children Â£250 in vouchers to spend on hospitality were being considered as an alternative The chancellor is also likely to announce a stamp duty holiday, reportedly aimed at first time buyers. The grants are part of a wider Â£3bn ""green investment"" package due to be announced in the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday, to support efforts to rebuild the economy after the pandemic. The plan aims to create tens of thousands of new jobs while helping the UK meet its 2050 target of achieving net zero carbon emissions. It will involve improving insulation in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and retro-fitting low-carbon heating technology to social housing. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The Conservative manifesto had pledged Â£9.2bn for improving the energy efficiency of low income housing and public buildings. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband welcomed the plan but stressed that it was not ""comprehensive"". ""It appears there is almost nothing for the people who rent the 8.5 million homes in the social rented sector and private rented sector, which has the worst energy efficiency standards. That means one-third of people are left out,"" he said. The Treasury says the Â£3bn investment plan will cut energy bills by an average of Â£200 for some of the UK's poorest households Mr Miliband said the government needed ""a much broader and bigger-scale strategy"" to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, including investing in nature conservation, increasing renewable energy, supporting manufacturers to be greener and improving transport. Meanwhile, Rosie Rogers, senior political advisor at Greenpeace UK, said the UK still wasn't ""playing in the same league"" as other countries, such as Germany, which is investing â¬40bn (Â£36bn) in green jobs and energy efficiency, or France, which pledged â¬15bn to tackle the climate crisis in June. The UK Treasury said the figures are not like-for-like. Ahead of Wednesday's summer statement, former Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Sunak faced an extraordinarily complex challenge in reviving the economy. He said Mr Sunak would need to support viable businesses affected by shutdowns, but also help ""a transition"" for businesses that are no longer economically viable. ""Some businesses will close, some viable businesses will close units,"" he said. Mr Hammond added that ""the other great unknown"" is that ""we don't know what the trajectory of the disease itself is going to be"". He said the economy was likely to start to bounce back quickly as restrictions are lifted, but that would tail off, and some parts of the economy such as hospitality, aviation, and entertainment could take years to recover. Meanwhile Alison Brittain, chief executive of Premier Inn owner Whitbread, said it would be ""enormously helpful"" if Mr Sunak took action to support the hospitality sector on Wednesday. ""Anything about VAT relief for guests and customers would be great,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""Anything on rates relief, still, because the business rates holiday was enormously important for the sector and if we could extend that a bit longer, that would be equally helpful to us.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland John Beattie posed the question to Fergus Ewing on Drivetime, who said testing upon arrival to Scotland was a ""reasonable approach"". ""It's one the health officials I'm sure will be considering,"" he said. ""I do expect an early announcement on all these matters. ""I go back to the fact that the best way to resume tourism is to see off the coronavirus, and it sadly it is still resident in far too many countries and is unwilling to leave."" Fiona WalkerBBC Scotland health correspondent BBC Scotland has had special access to a high security laboratory where they deal with live Coronavirus. At the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow scientists are growing the virus in order to find out more about Covid-19 and trace the different strains that come into Scotland. Hopefully what we do in here can help produce vaccines and help produce drugs and hopefully, in the end, get us to a situation where we are all back to normal. Angela Elliot, Centre for Virus Research You can see a full report on the work being done in this lab onReporting Scotland at 18:30 on BBC One Scotland. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing Scotland's rural economy and tourism minister says the first minister is expected to provide clarity on so-called air bridges ""very soon"". This would allow Scots to holiday abroad in certain countries, with no need to quarantine on their return. Fergus Ewing denies claims that the present situation is confusing for people in Scotland. He says: ""The primary duty the first minister set out is to keep people in Scotland safe and the encouraging reduction in cases and fatalities shows that is correct approach. ""Let's say there was free travel to Scotland and that resulted in a second wave, because we haven't done the checks about whether or not there was a high level of risk you'd be saying 'why weren't you more careful?' He adds: ""I would encourage people to have stay-cation in Scotland. We are gradually reopening but we can't do it all at once."" The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham said it was contacting customers People in Scotland are now able to return to beer gardens, however people have been able to visit pubs in England since 4 July. The landlady of one of the pubs in England which hashad to close after a customer tested positive for coronavirussaid the experience had been ""stressful"". Jess Green, landlady of The Lighthouse Kitchen pub in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme she rang at least 90 people who had left their contact details when they had visited after the lockdown was eased on Saturday. ""The main thing that was going through our heads was we had to make sure everyone was safe, that we contacted every one of our customers. ""It took us all day, we finished at about 10 o'clock last night. Our (list) was about 90 and there were actually more but if they were in a social bubble or a household, we took the main person and they spoke to the people they were with."" Allow Twitter content?

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The first minister has said she won't be rushed into making a decision on so called air bridges. Air bridges would allow Scots to holiday abroad in certain countries, with no need to quarantine on their return. As things stand, anyone flying into Scotland still has to quarantine for 14 days. Shona Thorne from Thorne Travel in Ayrshire tells Drivetime: ""People are still trying to fly abroad, but it's very confusing at this moment in time."" She says there are ""very mixed messages coming out"" on the issue. Ms Thorne calls for mandatory testing as soon as anyone lands in the country instead of automatic quarantine. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Edinburgh resident James McDonald has lived in his flat for over 40 years as an owner and occupier. He claims that when short-term let apps such as Airbnb came into common use, areas like his became a ""horror story"" as dozens of tourists would come into the building causing disruption without any accountability. The hospitality industry is set to open on 15 July, but James also claims that these lets have been available throughout the lockdown. ""All the ones in our area are available so they're obviously operating,"" he told Drivetime. ""I looked it up online and sure enough they're taking bookings and have done through the entire shut down. ""It's part of a long trend that's been going on for a while. We have these tourists coming in and no one has any idea which of these flats they're staying in, how long and who is responsible. ""Phoning the police is no use because they're away the next day anyway. Defacto, they are operating a hotel without a license."" The latestfigures from the Department of Health and Social care,externalhave been released, showing that a further 155 people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus. It makes the total number of deaths after a positive test in hospitals, care homes and the wider community 44,391. But it does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK. That figure is now thought to have passed 55,000. In Scotland a further one person died in the last 24 hours with Covid-19, taking the total to 2,489 deaths in Scotland by that measure. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took his fourth coronavirus test on Monday after developing Covid-19 symptoms, has tested positive for the virus. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks posed by the virus, calling it ""a little flu"" and saying that he would not be seriously affected by it. He has also urged regional governors to ease lockdowns, which he says hurt the economy, and on Monday he watered down regulations on wearing face masks. As of Monday, the number of deaths in Brazil was over 65,000 and infections were over 1.6m, second only to the United States. Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland John Finch who runs Saucy Desserts near Lockerbie tells Drivetime that around 40% of the shop's income is from events such as farmers markets and food festivals. As many of those events have been cancelled, he says the shop has had to change how it does business - such as by doing doorstep deliveries. ""It's good to meet customers,"" he says. ""But now lockdown is easing it's harder to catch people at home so we'll have to adapt again."" As for the impact of the travel restrictions in Dumfries and Galloway, John says it has changed how some people ""perceive holidaymakers"". He says: ""There were lots of anxieties around people coming in and this added further spice to it."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Stephen Montgomery who runs The Townhead Hotel in Lockerbie welcomes the news thattravel restrictions have been lifted in Dumfries and Gallowayfollowing a cluster of coronavirus cases. And while bookings are beginning to return, he says it will likely take a year before bookings from European holiday makers return to normal levels. He tells Drivetime with John Beattie: ""We obviously understand it was done for a reason. Opening up the area is very important to get the economy moving. ""But we've got to put health over profit,. We saw quite a few cancellations in the last week to 10 days but we're starting to see bookers come back in, particularly stay-cations. ""I think we'll be a while before we see the European market come back to fruition."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The Treasuryâs Â£1.57 billion of financial
backing vocals for the art and culture sector is bringing Â£97m to
Holyrood. The funding is part of this weekâs summer
stimulus of spending and support, being set out tomorrow by the Chancellor,
Rishi Sunak. A further splurge announced this morning is
of Â£3bn of greenery, including Â£2bn vouchers for English home-owners to make
energy efficient improvements. Expect a share of that for devolved
administrations, including Holyrood. This brings us back
to the question of what gets a share of funding to Holyrood and what is applied
directly in Scotland. Pre-briefing includes a report, in The Times,
that the property market is to get a stimulus from a cut to stamp duty in
England and Northern Ireland. That translates in Scotland to the Land and
Buildings Transaction Tax, wholly controlled from Holyrood. It can also choose
to cut those rates as a stimulus, but unlike Westminster, it canât borrow to
fill the gap created in its budget. The Times is also reporting there could be a
VAT cut aimed at restaurants and pubs. If that happens, that would cross the
border and apply equally to Scotland. The Scottish government wants extended
furlough funding, which has been done through the tax system at a UK-level. For the details though, weâll have to wait until
Wednesday, and later find out what the Scottish government intends to do with
additional funds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Mr Sunak said the investment would also help to ""kick-start our economy"" by creating thousands of jobs and providing business for existing skilled workers, as the UK recovers from the economic shock of coronavirus. ""As Britain recovers from the outbreak, it's vital we do everything in our power to support and protect livelihoods across the nation,"" he said. The governmentwill pledge to provide 30,000 new traineeshipsto get young people in England into work, giving firms Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer According to reports, there could be a short-term VAT cut for the ailing hospitality industry to help lift demand However, the Observer reported that plans to give all adults Â£500 and children Â£250 in vouchers to spend on hospitality were being considered as an alternative The chancellor is also likely to announce a stamp duty holiday, reportedly aimed at first time buyers. The grants are part of a wider Â£3bn ""green investment"" package due to be announced in the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday, to support efforts to rebuild the economy after the pandemic. The plan aims to create tens of thousands of new jobs while helping the UK meet its 2050 target of achieving net zero carbon emissions. It will involve improving insulation in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and retro-fitting low-carbon heating technology to social housing. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The Conservative manifesto had pledged Â£9.2bn for improving the energy efficiency of low income housing and public buildings. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband welcomed the plan but stressed that it was not ""comprehensive"". ""It appears there is almost nothing for the people who rent the 8.5 million homes in the social rented sector and private rented sector, which has the worst energy efficiency standards. That means one-third of people are left out,"" he said. The Treasury says the Â£3bn investment plan will cut energy bills by an average of Â£200 for some of the UK's poorest households Mr Miliband said the government needed ""a much broader and bigger-scale strategy"" to meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, including investing in nature conservation, increasing renewable energy, supporting manufacturers to be greener and improving transport. Meanwhile, Rosie Rogers, senior political advisor at Greenpeace UK, said the UK still wasn't ""playing in the same league"" as other countries, such as Germany, which is investing â¬40bn (Â£36bn) in green jobs and energy efficiency, or France, which pledged â¬15bn to tackle the climate crisis in June. The UK Treasury said the figures are not like-for-like. Ahead of Wednesday's summer statement, former Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Sunak faced an extraordinarily complex challenge in reviving the economy. He said Mr Sunak would need to support viable businesses affected by shutdowns, but also help ""a transition"" for businesses that are no longer economically viable. ""Some businesses will close, some viable businesses will close units,"" he said. Mr Hammond added that ""the other great unknown"" is that ""we don't know what the trajectory of the disease itself is going to be"". He said the economy was likely to start to bounce back quickly as restrictions are lifted, but that would tail off, and some parts of the economy such as hospitality, aviation, and entertainment could take years to recover. Meanwhile Alison Brittain, chief executive of Premier Inn owner Whitbread, said it would be ""enormously helpful"" if Mr Sunak took action to support the hospitality sector on Wednesday. ""Anything about VAT relief for guests and customers would be great,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""Anything on rates relief, still, because the business rates holiday was enormously important for the sector and if we could extend that a bit longer, that would be equally helpful to us.""

"TikTok has said it will quit Hong Kong after China imposed a new security law on the city. ""In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The company's exit from the city will come ""within days,"" according to the Reuters news agency. Facebook and Twitter said this week they were ""pausing"" co-operation with Hong Kong police over user information. The short-form video app was launched by China-based ByteDance for users outside mainland China as part of a strategy to grow its global audience. The tech company operates a similar short video sharing app in China called Douyin. TikTok's Boogaloo extremism problem TikTok ban surprises India content makers TikTok, now run by former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app's user data is not stored in China. The company has also said previously that it would not comply with any Chinese government requests to censor content or give access to its users' data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. However, the controversial national security law in Hong Kong has given Chinese authorities sweeping new powers, raising concerns about data privacy. The legislation punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison. Critics say it erodes Hong Kong's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, including freedom of speech. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google and Telegram have all announced this week that they are also making changes to their operations in Hong Kong after the new security law came into force last week. The tech firms have said they are not processing data requests from the Hong Kong police while they assess the ongoing political changes in the city. TikTok's decision to stop operations in Hong Kong of its popular video app looks unusual - but is strategic. The company has struggled to fight off suspicions that it operates under Chinese law, or under the control of Beijing. Which is why TikTok has been at pains to try to change its global image - and this move could be one more step towards doing that. TikTok has also consistently said that if asked, it would never hand over data to Beijing - and that it's never been asked for any user data either. Staying in Hong Kong, under the new law, may make it difficult for it to keep to that commitment. Its biggest market is India - where it has recently been banned by the Indian government because of a border conflict with China. Analysts say it could potentially lose up to a billion dollars in lost advertising revenue in India. Which is why it is keen to show that it is not simply a Chinese-owned firm - but a global company that is also an international and responsible social media player. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the national security law imposed by Beijing saying it was not ""doom and gloom"" for the city. Ms Lam said the law would restore Hong Kong's status as one of the safest cities in the world after pro-democracy protests last year often turned violent. ""Compared with the national security laws of other countries, it is a rather mild law. Its scope is not as broad as that in other countries and even China,"" she said. The legislation has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997. Also on Tuesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the US is ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok. ""I don't want to get out in front of the President (Donald Trump), but it's something we're looking at,"" Mr Pompeo said. In response to Mr Pompeo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US. ""We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.""

"Strawberries and cream, maybe even a glass of rosÃ©: the ""summer update"" has a whiff of end-of term festivities. But the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday may impact millions of livelihoods - and his own reputation. The grants, subsidies and loans deployed to shield the British economy from the shock of lockdown didn't manage to preserve all jobs. However, they ensured that lay-offs in the first couple of months of lockdown were in the thousands, rather than millions. The real test for Rishi Sunak starts now. As one of his predecessors remarked, everyone loves the chancellor when he's splashing the cash, and those schemes have cost tens of billions - in total he's staring at a Â£300bn deficit this year. With the furlough scheme set to be wound down, it's clear crippling job losses in some sectors are under way. This emergency mini-Budget on Wednesday will attempt to help minimise the pain as the economy convalesces by ""flattening the curve"" - this time of job losses - and to prevent the kind of lingering mass joblessness last seen when the chancellor was a toddler, that risks blighting millions of lives. Here are five areas to bear in mind - we already know some of what he'll look at, but there's more to come. At present, some economists say unemployment could triple to over four million this year. Rishi Sunak is expected to detail the beefing up of job centres, with more work coaches and advisers - underscoring that the government too is getting ready for an onslaught of losses. The rise in joblessness won't be fleeting; the first advisers won't be in place until October. There's more money for careers advice too, and work placements. Learning new skills will be vital - particularly for the youngest workers and lowest paid who've been particularly badly hit. Rishi Sunak has talked of preserving jobs where possible, and that may mean taking different approaches with different industries. A skilled workforce isn't enough; you need the demand for their talents - in other words, flourishing businesses. And some of those are suffering simply because they've not been able to open yet. Lyceum Theatre in London, home to the Lion King, was wrapped in messages of support last week in a campaign calling on the government to prevent the arts industry from collapse The struggling arts and heritage sectorhas been promised a Â£1.6bn bespoke package of loans and grants. That's a shift away from the Treasury's previous reluctance to provide tailored help - and may raise hopes elsewhere. But will those industries that don't have the glamour of showbiz, with high-profile spokespeople, be as lucky? The package for the arts sector may signal that the chancellor remains reluctant to extend the furlough scheme, even for struggling sectors. Some sectors - travel, for example - may fail to ever fully recover in the absence of a vaccine. Rather than prop them up, some argue it would be better to divert resources to supporting growing industries. Rishi Sunak is expected to earmark some cash to support green jobs and to promote environmentally friendly home improvements. Incentives for other ""new"" industries may also feature. Even the future of businesses who have reopened may not be secure, unless customers feel safe coming back, not just physically, but financially. Rishi Sunak has stopped short of a haircut photo opportunity, but he's set the tone with visits to shops, markets and even the pub, despite being teetotal. Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Rishi Sunak urged by MPs to extend self-employed help What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? And now he may be after our bank accounts. A record amount of money was stashed away in May as the majority of the population saw their incomes untroubled, but their spending reduced. An emergency short-term VAT cut of say, 2% or 3%, targeted at perhaps the hospitality industry may tempt us to part with some cash. A waiter serves drinks to diners in the Soho area of London on Saturday as pubs and bars reopened A similar cut was tried during the financial crisis but its impact was limited. Other ideas that have been touted include state-issued vouchers to spend on holidays, or changes to National Insurance contributions. All would bear a cost of billions. The next annual Budget is due in the autumn, which gives the chancellor time to mull over how the economy is progressing and introduce more measures, alongside the usual forecasts. We may, however, not have to wait that long for rumoured temporary changes to stamp duty. Some now expect that measure, which would boost the fortunes of homebuyers and housebuilders, to come up this Wednesday. At that Budget, we may hear more about how he will pay for all this. At present, the government is able to borrow cheaply via bonds on the financial markets, but there are limits. Mr Sunak may have to find other ways of footing the bill, such as pausing the ""triple lock"" formula used to calculate pension rises, for example. That won't be popular. Five months into the job, Mr Sunak is enjoying popularity ratings far in excess of that of his Cabinet colleagues, thanks to his handling of the economic crisis so far. Hanging on to that pole position over the challenging months - or even years - ahead will be no picnic. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.

"Restrictions on daily life in many parts of the UK - to try to curb the spread of coronavirus - have been eased in recent weeks. Employers in England can bring staff back to the workplace and people can use public transport for non-essential journeys (while wearing face coverings). Many pubs, shops and restaurants have reopened, while most of those who have been shielding are no longer advised to stay at home. There are places where the easing of lockdown measures has been halted - Leicester and Greater Manchester, for example. But, overall, how have people in the UK responded? More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit.
