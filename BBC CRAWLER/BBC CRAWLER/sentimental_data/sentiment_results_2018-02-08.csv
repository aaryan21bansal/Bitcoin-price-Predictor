"Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh (l to r) A man who was alleged to have been part of an Islamic State group known as the Beatles has been charged and remanded in custody in the UK. Aine Davis, from west London, had just returned from Turkey, where he had served seven and a half years for terrorism offences. He has been charged with offences related to funding terrorism. Members of the group, known as the Beatles because of their British accents, murdered hostages while fighting with the IS in Syria. Davis denied being a member of the group. The four members who are said to be part of the group all grew up in west London and volunteered to fight for the Islamic State group in Syria. They ended up guarding Western hostages. US authorities say the group beheaded 27 hostages. Videos of the murders were sent around the world, causing outrage. Hostages also recall the group torturing with electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions. They were""thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"", Spanish journalist and former hostage Javier Espinosa told BBC News, in 2017. Three are still living - Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey, El Shafee Elsheikh. Mohammed Emwazi, who was nicknamed Jihadi John, was killed in Syria, in 2015. Aine Davis Davis, who lived in Hammersmith, had a number of drug convictions and was jailed in 2006 for possessing a firearm. After converting to Islam, Davis changed his name to Hamza and met Emwazi. The two were part of a group that radicalised Muslims living in London. Davis left the UK to join IS in 2013. Davis was jailed for seven and a half years in Turkey Davis was arrested near Istanbul in 2015 and in 2017 he was convicted by a Turkish court of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation. At his trial in Turkey, Davis admitted knowing Mohammed Emwazi from praying in the same mosque in west London, but denied being his friend, or a member of the ""IS Beatles"" group. He served seven and a half years in prison. Arriving back in Britain at Luton Airport in August 2022, Davis was arrested by counter-terrorism officers from the Met Police and charged with offences including possession of a firearm for a purpose connected with terrorism, and charges related to funding terrorism. Alexanda Kotey Alexanda Kotey was sentenced in April 2022 to life imprisonment in the US, having pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges including lethal hostage-taking and conspiracy to support terrorists. He admitted involvement in the deaths of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Sentencing him, thejudge described his actions as ""egregious, violent and inhumane"". Kotey was one of two men reportedly ""unmasked"" by media reports in 2016 These offences carry the death penalty - but US authorities have told Britain they will not execute Kotey, who is 38. Instead, he faces life imprisonment. He has been stripped of his British citizenship. Living in west London, Kotey - who is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background - had attended the al-Manaar mosque with Mohammed Emwazi. He was captured in Syria by Kurdish forces, alongside El Shafee Elsheikh. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The cell is also blamed for the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. El Shafee Elsheikh The son of Sudanese refugees who came to Britain, Elsheikh, went to Syria in 2012 and joined al-Qaeda before signing up with IS. Hostages called him Jihadi George and say as the main guard, he carried out most of the torture. Elsheikh was captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in January 2018, as they overran the last pieces of IS-controlled territory in Syria. El Shafee Elsheikh is said to have earned a reputation for ""waterboarding, mock executions and crucifixions"" He wasfound guilty of lethal hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder. He was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018. Mohammed Emwazi Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John, fronted a number of videos showing executed hostages. Born in Kuwait, his family moved to the UK when he was six years old, in 1988. He studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, graduating in 2009. Emwazi, thought to be the group's ringleader, was killed after an intensive manhunt in 2015 Throughout 2014, Emwazi was shown, with his face disguised, in a number of videos where Western hostages appeared to be beheaded. A top target for intelligence services,he was killed in a joint US-British drone strike in Syria, in November 2015.

"Cambodian police released a group shot of the 10 arrested foreigners in January A court in Cambodia has granted bail to seven of the 10 foreign tourists who were charged last month with producing pornographic images. The group were arrested in January after photographs emerged of people imitating sex acts at a party in a villa in north-west Siem Reap province. If convicted, they could face up to a year in a Cambodian prison. Three of the alleged party organisers - from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway, remain in custody. A total of 87 foreigners were arrested on Jan 25 in a raid on a ""Let's get wet"" pub crawl event, after being accused by police of ""singing and dancing pornographically"". Police say most were released after being ""educated"" over their unacceptable behaviour. But ten members - five Britons, two Canadians, a Norwegian, a New Zealander and a Dutch national, were charged and detained in custody. Images allegedly from the pub crawl event showed several clothed couples on the floor of the villa, appearing to act out sexual positions. The Angkor Wat temple is a world heritage site, drawing tourists to Siem Reap province The British Foreign Office confirmed on Thursday that four British nationals were among those released on bail. They said staff continued to assist the nationals and remain in contact with the Cambodian authorities. A spokesman for the Siem Reap provincial court said those released on bail could not leave the country as they their passports had been confiscated. Siem Reap is popular with tourists because it is close to the famous ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's biggest tourist site. A police handout picture of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party The country's nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years as it has become more popular among backpackers and budget travellers. This has sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative Buddhist culture. In 2016 the country announced a ban on tourists wearing ""revealing clothes"" from visiting the ancient temple park, after a number of foreign tourists were arrested and deported for taking nude photographs at the site.

"David Davis has described a leaked EU paper suggesting it could cut UK access to the single market if there was a post-Brexit row as ""discourteous"". A draft document leaked on Wednesday suggested any dispute could mean UK benefits being suspended in the ""transition period"" after Brexit. The UK Brexit secretary said it had not been ""in good faith"" to publish it. He also said every economic forecast about Brexit had been ""proven wrong so far"". Official forecasts out earlier suggested it would mean a slowdown in growth across the UK. May and ministers hammer out Brexit stance Negative Brexit forecasts revealed EU 'seeks single market sanction power' How to make sense of those pesky Brexit forecasts Mr Davis was speaking after the prime minister chaired meetings of the Brexit cabinet committee, aimed at sketching out what the UK wanted its future relationship with the EU to look like. He said the atmosphere had been ""very constructive"" and there had been ""lots of things resolved"" but admitted there was ""still progress to be made"". He described the draft section of the withdrawal agreement that leaked out on Wednesday as ""hardly a legal document, it was a political document"". ""What we're about, is building an implementation period which is to build a bridge to a future where we work well together,"" he said. ""I do not think it was in good faith to publish a document with frankly discourteous language and implying that they could arbitrarily terminate in effect the implementation period. ""That's not what the aim of this exercise is. It's not in good faith. We think it was unwise to publish that."" The transition - or implementation - period is expected to begin straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union, on 29 March 2019, and end on 31 December 2020. The UK says this will allow businesses to adapt to its new relationship with the EU. The EU says its rules should still apply during the transition period, as will rulings of the European Court of Justice. According toa footnote in the EU papers leaked to journalistsin Brussels, if referring a dispute to the EU court during that period took too long, the withdrawal agreement ""should provide for a mechanism allowing the union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market"". Mr Davis was also asked about UK officials' economic forecasts that model the 15-year impact of the UK: staying in the single market doing a trade deal with the EU leaving without a deal The government agreed to show them to MPs, following a leak of some of the information to Buzzfeed last week. The estimates suggested north-east England and the West Midlands would be hardest hit although others would also see a slowdown in growth. But Mr Davis said: ""Every single financial or economic forecast related to Brexit has proven wrong so far, massively wrong - all on the same side, all underestimating the progress of the economy. ""[The] second point is that this is a work in progress. This is not a complete policy document. ""You wouldn't drive a car that is half finished. You shouldn't use a forecast that is half complete."" A Downing street source said the prime minister had told the Brexit cabinet committee that her starting point was to aim for ""something that hadn't been done before in order to come to a new relationship that will last a generation or more"". Meanwhile Italian MEP Roberto Gualtieri, who sits on the European Parliament's Brexit steering committee, said it was unlikely, during the transition period, that Britain would have to follow any new EU rules drawn up when it was no longer a member state. He said it was unlikely there would be time for new legislation to be brought forward within the period - expected to be around two years - because of European Parliament elections in 2019 and the fact a new European Commission would not be in place until autumn that year. David Davis says the UK will seek an ""appropriate process"" to object to any new laws introduced during the period. But Mr Gualtieri said the UK was likely to have had its say as a member state on any new EU rules that come into force during that period.

"Model Chloe Ayling has told her lawyer she is saddened that many people do not believe she was kidnapped in Italy last summer, as a trial begins in Milan. Lucasz Herba, 30, is accused of luring the 20-year-old from south London to Milan with the promise of a photoshoot, and then kidnapping her for a ransom. Ms Ayling's lawyer, Francesco Pesce, told the BBC his client had been terrorised and threatened with death. Mr Herba argues that Ms Ayling was a willing participant in her abduction. On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, a police officer told the Milan court that Ms Ayling had been drugged, handcuffed and transported in a suitcase. He said she had suffered mental and physical abuse during the six-day ordeal last July. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling would not give evidence in court because she did not want to see her alleged kidnapper's face again. He said she had been interrogated for almost 13 hours last August and her request not to return to Italy for the trial had been granted. ""She's had enough,"" he said, adding that she was currently ""putting herself back together"" and had returned to modelling. ""She is saddened by the fact that many people don't believe her story. But she is strong and she will carry on,"" he said. Asked about a video which emerged of Ms Ayling and Mr Herba holding hands, Mr Pesce said: ""There is nothing to defend. ""She doesn't appear to be happy or smiley - she acts like a hostage. ""She was being terrorised by this man, who kidnapped her and took her to a place in the middle of nowhere. It was psychological terrorism."" Lucasz Herba says Ms Ayling was a willing participant in her own abduction Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling's alleged kidnapper threatened to kill her if she tried anything so she ""played the friendship card"". ""She wanted to stay on his good side - as the alternative was to die,"" he said. ""She thought this was her only hope... and it worked."" Mr Pesce said Mr Herba seemed to have a ""change of heart"" when he discovered Ms Ayling was a mother, and told her he would free her. If convicted, Mr Herba, from Poland, faces up to 25 years in prison for abduction. The trial continues.

"Same-sex marriages on Bermuda-registered cruise lines like Cunard and P&O Cruises will be outlawed The UK government has said it would not be ""appropriate"" to block Bermuda's decision to repeal same-sex marriage. On Wednesday the British overseas territory became the first country in the world to pass, and then revoke, the law, replacing gay marriage with domestic partnerships. The decision also means cruise ships registered in Bermuda are likely to be banned from hosting same-sex weddings. Theresa May said the UK's dealings with Bermuda should be based on ""respect"". But critics say the law reversal will make the UK an international ""laughing stock"". The Atlantic island, which is home to 60,000 people, legalised marriage between homosexual couples in May 2017, following a Supreme Court ruling. Gay marriage: First couples wed in Australia NI Secretary Karen Bradley rejects same-sex marriage call California judge sides with baker in 'gay cake' row But thenew Domestic Partnership Act,external, approved by Bermuda Governor John Rankin on Wednesday, rolls back the legalisation. Instead of marriage, the act allows gay or straight couples to form a partnership, which the Bermuda government says carries equivalent rights. According to Bermuda's minister of home affairs, Walton Brown, the majority of Bermudians do not agree with gay couples marrying. He said: ""The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples."" Because of Bermuda's status as an overseas dependent territory, the UK government had the power to block the law change. But Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told MPs: ""After full and careful consideration in regards to Bermuda's constitutional and international obligations, the Secretary decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to use this power to block legislation, which can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional circumstances."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""seriously disappointed"" about the decision to abolish same-sex marriage. But she added: ""That bill has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government."" MPs on all sides criticised the decision and called it a backward step. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the law reversal will make Britain a ""laughing stock in the international human rights field"".

Raising the issue in the Commons as an urgent question, Mr Bryant added: ""Same-sex Bermudian couples who have been married under the ruling of the Bermudian Supreme Court have now been rendered an anomaly. ""Gay and lesbian Bermudians have been told that they aren't quite equal to everyone else."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The problem, as many MPs pointed out, is that Britain may now find it harder to promote LGBT rights around the world when it has failed to do so in one of its own overseas territories."" The cruise companies Cunard and P&O Cruises, both of which register their ships in Bermuda, said they were ""very unhappy"" about the change in legislation, which will outlaw same-sex marriage ceremonies on their liners. ""We do not underestimate the disappointment this will cause those guests who have planned their weddings,"" the companies said in an identically-worded statement. Instead, the firms will offering same-sex couples on-board alternative ""commitment"" ceremonies.

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track. Bank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. However, they said rates would need to rise ""earlier"" and by a ""somewhat greater extent"" than they thought at their last review in November. Economists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May. The value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments. Higher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy. Live: Pound jumps as rates hold steady What would a rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Growth better, but warning lights flashing on rates Five key messages from the Bank of England Around 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. Interest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England. But for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. In November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%. Its forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years. But it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected. ""The Committee judges thatâ¦ monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,"" minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said. The Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth. It also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost. As a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. But it says its forecasts are based on a ""smooth"" adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Read Kamal's blog in full Economists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain. ""All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%."" Official figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting. Unemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%. The Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November. In the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was ""almost entirely"" due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.

"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Bank of England hints at earlier rate rises What has driven the Dow's surge? US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts Also worrying markets was agovernment budget proposalUS lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings."" But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."" Stock markets: Your questions answered Ahmed: Will fall turn into rout? Did robots trigger the market plunge?

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track. Bank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. However, they said rates would need to rise ""earlier"" and by a ""somewhat greater extent"" than they thought at their last review in November. Economists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May. The value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments. Higher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy. Live: Pound jumps as rates hold steady What would a rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Growth better, but warning lights flashing on rates Five key messages from the Bank of England Around 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. Interest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England. But for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. In November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%. Its forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years. But it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected. ""The Committee judges thatâ¦ monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,"" minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said. The Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth. It also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost. As a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. But it says its forecasts are based on a ""smooth"" adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Read Kamal's blog in full Economists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain. ""All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%."" Official figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting. Unemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%. The Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November. In the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was ""almost entirely"" due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.

"Twitter has reported its first quarterly net profit helped by a rise in video advertising sales. The news gave a massive boost to Twitter's shares which closed 12% up on the day. That was despite the number of people using the social network coming in below expectations. Twitter's previous failure to make a profit had confounded investors given its widespread use and popularity among celebrities and politicians. Net profit was $91.1m (Â£65m) in the fourth quarter of 2017,external, compared with a loss of $167.1m for the same period a year ago. Twitter, which has posted consistent losses since it became a public company in 2013, said it expected to be profitable for the full year of 2018 as well. The company has found success with video and other changes, deepening the experiences on offer, James Erkine, director at marketing firm The Social Circle, told the BBC. ""It's now about taking that scalable model and using it to reach new user groups to increase their user base,"" he said. ""Hopefully now they've made a profit once, they should be able to do it next quarter and carry on doing it."" In October last year, Twitter had suggested a profit was likely as it sought to cut costs, including by slashing stock-based compensation. Revenue in the quarter rose 2% to $732m, as growth internationally offset a decline in the US. User growth, however, remained fairly flat. The firm reported 330 million active users a month, a rise of 4% on last year but no change on the previous quarter. Monthly active users in the US were down to 68 million from 69 million in the third quarter. Twitter said user numbers had been hurt by changes made by Apple to its Safari web browser. A crackdown on fake accounts also contributed to the lacklustre growth, it said. The firm has faced controversy over use of the platform during political events, including Brexit and the 2016 presidential election in America. The firm's shares were trading around $32 per share in mid-morning trade.

"Dozens of protesters have gathered outside a London cinema to protest against the cancellation of a screening of a film advocating therapy to ""cure"" people from being gay. Christian group Core Issues Trust hired a screen at Vue Piccadilly, in the West End, to show its film - the Voices of the Silenced. But the cinema cancelled the event at the last minute, saying it contradicted the company's values. Protesters accused Vue of censorship. According to the film's makers, the documentary tells the stories of 15 people ""emerging out of homosexual lifestyles"" and aims to ""preserve and promote teachings on sexual ethics"". I was sent for 'gay cure' Push to ban 'gay conversion therapy' 'Gay cure' group's advert banned 'Pray the gay away' Michael Davidson, who leads Core Issues Trust, said the film was ""very niche"" and reflected ""our community"", which he says is a small but growing international group. The cancellation was regrettable and showed no regard for this section of the population, he added. He said the film did not disrespect the LGBT community. Rather, it raised issues from a different point of view. Michael Davidson, pictured right, says the cancellation was regrettable and showed no regard for this section of the population Andrea Williams, chief executive ofChristian Concern,external, an organisation which wants to see the UK ""return to the Christian faith"", said the Vue's decision to cancel had been ""tragic and disproportionate"". ""This is a freedom issue,"" she told the BBC. ""This film is the stories of lives that are transformed, marriages saved, fathers who stay fathers. ""There is nothing wrong with saying I don't want to do that any more. I want to access therapy to help me live in a different way,"" she said. The protest was, she added, about showing people: ""We are not going away."" The film was screened instead at an alternative venue, at a nearby conference centre in Westminster. In a statement, Vue said it was not ""our intention to censor content"". ""In some instances, where we feel that an activity and its associated campaign and content are in direct contradiction with Vue's values, we make the decision to refrain from allowing that activity to take place in our cinemas,"" it added. It said management had been made aware the private screening request would be promoting and campaigning for a medical ""cure"" to homosexuality. ""After careful consideration of the facts, a decision was made to cancel the event,"" it added. The decision, made on Tuesday, was reached independently of any external influence, including media, social media or petitions, it said. It went on to say that the Vue would ""always consider, and be sensitive to, our customers when we are asked to promote or indirectly endorse, or act as host for, one particular cause, campaign or belief"". The Core Issues Trust promotes ""change-oriented processes"" for ""relationally and sexually damaged and wounded adults who seek wholeness"". It describes itself on its website as ""a spiritual home... for believers and seekers who struggle with issues of sexual brokenness, including homosexuality"". Members of the LGBT community have said the organisation's teachings are ""unethical"". A spokesperson for campaign group Stonewall said: ""LGBT people aren't ill. Being gay, lesbian, bi or trans is not something that should be 'cured' or changed. ""This unethical and degrading practice has been condemned by all major UK health organisations.

"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% after much speculation. Expectations of a strengthening economy, solid employment levels, more consumer spending and the potential for wages to rise have all played a part in the decision. The Bank's main priority is to keep the rising cost of living - known as inflation - under control. It uses its key interest rate, known as the Bank rate or base rate, which is the reference point for how much banks and building societies pay savers and charge borrowers in interest. Generally, a rise in the Bank rate is good for the UK's 45 million savers and bad for borrowers - but the reality is a bit more nuanced. Here are the key points. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% Across the UK, 9.1 million households have a mortgage. Of these, more than 3.5 million are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. These are the people who would be most affected, as their monthly payments would increase. The relatively small rise will not be particularly painful for the vast majority of householders, although debt charities say that some squeezed families will find this extra burden a real challenge. Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances. The average outstanding balance is Â£112,000. For somebody with 20 years left on this mortgage, the monthly bill rise by about Â£14 a month. For those with a larger balance, then clearly the rise in the mortgage bill will be greater. The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 96% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years. Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to about 4.7 million households. Some of these rates are expected to rise after the latest announcement. Of course, none of these borrowers would see an immediate rise. However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments. That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal. Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive. Some rates may rise on other types of borrowing such as personal loans and credit cards. Should they rise, that would have relatively little impact on a credit card interest rate that is generally about 18%. When base rates rise, so do savings rates, in theory. But it depends on the extent to which banks and building societies want to increase their deposits. So after November's rate increase, banks were slow to pass on any rise to savers, or they typically passed ona fraction of the full increase. In fact, half of all savings accounts did not move at all after the last Bank rate rise in November. Commentators say savers could probably expect something similar this time. According to the Bank of England, returns on longer-term cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) were little changed in December. Yet they jumped significantly in January, with average returns on cash ISAs going up from 0.36% to 0.94%. In February and March they held steady at 0.86%, before falling subsequently to 0.63% by the end of June. For the average cash Isa saver with Â£11,200 locked away, the latest rise - if passed on - could mean Â£28 more a year in interest. Any rate rise might also good for retirees buying an annuity - a financial product that provides an income for life. Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. These yields could be expected to rise amid an environment of rising interest rates, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity. Back in November 2011, a 65-year-old buying a joint annuity for Â£100,000 would have got an annual income of Â£5,404. Last year, that had dropped by Â£1,318 to Â£4,086. However, by now this has risen to about Â£4,670. Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up. According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates - but this remains a long-term consideration. ""Annuity rates have been in the doldrums since the EU referendum in 2016, when gilt yields fell dramatically. Any increase in the bank rate should result in higher gilt yields, which will in turn lead to higher annuities,"" he said. ""However, don't hold your breath waiting for annuity rates to rise, because it is normally a slow process."" But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a Â£100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of about Â£15,000 a year.

"US-allied SDF fighters control territory east of the River Euphrates Syria has accused the US of carrying out a ""brutal massacre"" with a bombing attack in Deir al-Zour province. The overnight air and artillery strikes killed an estimated 100 pro-government fighters near the Euphrates river, according to the US. It claimed a right to self-defence, saying it was responding to an attack on its coalition forces. The Pentagon said Russian mercenaries were also killed, but Russia denies having personnel in the area. The strikes happened in the Middle Euphrates Valley, which serves as an informal demarcation line in eastern Syria. The government controls the western side and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) the east. The two sides have clashed over the past year while trying to drive Islamic State (IS) militants from their last major stronghold in the country. What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The rapid rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts The US said the forces aligned with the Syrian government crossed the agreed line and launched an ""unprovoked attack"" on an SDF headquarters late on Wednesday, near the town of Khursham. It said 500 pro-government fighters, backed by artillery, tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems and mortars, were involved in the assault. Syrian news channel Al-Ikhbariyah said the bombing left ""dozens of dead and wounded"", and identified the pro-government fighters as ""local people"". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said they were local tribesmen loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and Afghan Shia militiamen. One member of the SDF - which is mostly Kurds and Arab fighters - was reportedly wounded in the incident, and there were no US casualties. Pro-government forces control the city of Deir al-Zour and territory west of the River Euphrates A Pentagon official said Russian mercenaries were among the dead. If confirmed, this would be the first time US forces have killed Russians in Syria. However, the Russian Defence Ministry said it was only aware of 25 Syrian militia being wounded in the strikes, and no casualties. The Pentagon said it had been in constant contact with Russia, raising concerns about a build-up of forces beside the SDF headquarters. US Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesperson, told the BBC that Russia had assured them they were not involved, and so they felt free to launch strikes. ""Everyday we communicate with our Russian counterparts so when this attack occurred they, the best way to say it is, gave us the green light,"" he said. This video can not be played Syria accuses the US of carrying out a ""massacre"" after strikes in Deir al-Zour province By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent US and Russian forces in Syria have a communications line open 24 hours a day to ensure that they do not attack each other. This is a matter of what the US military calls ""deconfliction"", not co-ordination. Initially the line - which has been supplemented on occasions by face-to-face meetings of more senior officers - was focussed on avoiding close encounters in the air. But increasingly - as IS has been rolled up - the ""deconfliction"" mechanism has been used to try to avoid contacts on the ground as well. The line was used prior to this latest incident - not least to ensure that Russian army personnel were not located in the target zone. To say, as the US spokesman did, that the Russians gave a ""green light"" to the operation is perhaps an exaggeration. But, satisfied that warning had been given, the US engaged the pro-government Syrian fighters with artillery and air strikes, and this appears to have inflicted significant casualties. The Syrian foreign ministry said it had written to the United Nations, demanding international condemnation. It described the latest strikes as ""a war crime and a crime against humanity"", and said the US was directly supporting terrorism. The UN has called for a month-long ceasefire in the country, as violence escalates. Elsewhere in the country, Syrian forces have bombed the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital, Damascus, for the past four days.At least 201 people have been killed since Monday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Syrian government has also been accused of using chemical weapons on a rebel-held town in Idlibprovince earlier this week. One US official told Reuters news agency that the pro-Syrian forces were ""likely seeking to seize oilfields in Khusham that had been a major source of revenue for [IS] from 2014 to 2017"", the official added. Both Russia and the US have accused each other of operating in the area to seize control of local oil operations. Before the war, the Omar oil field was producing 30,000 barrels of oil per day, while the Conoco gas field was producing 13m cubic metres of gas per day. US claims self-defence in eastern Syria.

"Imported inflation that followed the pound's fall post Brexit is easing back - and wages starting to grow While policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%, there were signs that further increases could be on the way. Stronger global growth is expected to help the UK economy, as inflation starts to ease and pay begins to increase. Here are five key messages from the Bank of England's latest Inflation Report: Prices have been rising faster than pay for much of the last year. However, the Bank believes the era of falling real pay - once inflation is factored in - is coming to an end. It noted that pay growth had already returned to around its pre-crisis rate for those switching jobs and said there were signs that pay rises would soon spread. A survey conducted by the Bank's Agents, which serve as its eyes and ears across the country, showed that private sector companies expect to increase staff pay by around 3.1% this year. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), rose to 3.1% in November, which is well above the Bank's 2% target. The fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote pushed up import costs, which translated into higher shop prices. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, warned that while inflation could once again rise above 3% mainly due to rising oil prices, policymakers expected inflation to ease back as the impact of the fall in the value of the pound diminishes. However, the MPC expects domestic cost pressures to build. The Bank has the power to keep a lid on these pressures as they build, which is why they are signalling that the next rate rise could be around the corner. Britain's jobs-rich recovery is expected to continue in the coming years, with the unemployment rate remaining at a four-decade low until the start of the next decade. In recent years, the Bank has lowered its estimate of how low it believes the unemployment rate can go before inflationary pressures start to build through employers needing to offer higher wages to attract and retain staff. A couple of years ago, the Bank said inflationary pressures would start to build when unemployment dropped to 5% but it has since reduced this so-called ""natural rate"" to 4.25%, slightly below the current unemployment rate of 4.3%. There are three main factors behind this: Firstly, people are living longer and retiring later. Secondly, we're smarter. A longer period in education means people are more adaptable when a downturn hits and are able to stay in work. Thirdly, a series of reforms to the benefits system have helped to make work pay. The Bank said the vote to leave the European Union had made Britain a less attractive place to work. The pound buys fewer euros and dollars for those sending money abroad, while a stronger European economy means more people can get work at home. The Bank said falling net migration would affect the outlook for the economy, which could hit medium-term UK growth. The interest rate rise from 0.25% to 0.5% last November has been felt differently by consumers and businesses. Most businesses with variable credit are paying more interest on their loans, but competition among high street banks has helped to keep personal loan rates down, with the average rate on an unsecured Â£10,000 rising by just four basis points - 0.04% - since last summer. Also, while on average banks and building societies have passed on the full rate increase to households with variable rate mortgages, the rate of interest earned on the average instant-access savings account has only edged up by seven basis points. The global economy is firing on all cylinders and is expected this year to grow at a pace not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis and this is expected to lift UK economic growth. While growth of around 1.8% over the next three years may not seem spectacular, the Bank has already warned that the UK may not be able to grow much above 1.5% per year before policymakers have to raise interest rates to prevent it from overheating. Raising the UK's long-term growth will require stronger productivity growth and investment, which will help to increase the speed limit of the economy. This will determine whether the UK is left in the slow lane. Graphics produced by Daniele Palumbo.

"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Dow Jones closes down 4.15% Pound under $1.39 Bank holds rates at 0.5% Debenhams cuts 320 jobs Chris Johnston That's all we have time for on Business Live today - thanks for reading. We're back bright and early at 06:00 tomorrow, so do join us then. Let's get a quick update on Twitter shares now - they ended the day 12% ahead. They had  surged by more than 18% in early trade on the news that the company had reported its first quarterly net profit.  Explaining the big falls Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner with Meridian Equity Partners in New York said: ""The dust hasn't settled yet, and I think both buyers and
sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants
to do. ""I would think that this continues to happen for the next
few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out."" To put those fall on Wall Street into context both the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow have fallen by more than 10% from the record highs they hit on 26 January. Female prisoners on a cycle mechanic training scheme launched by Halfords have gone on to work for the retailer after finishing their sentence, it has emerged. The Halfords Academy was launched a year ago at HMP Drake Hall, Stafford, aimed at women inmates who wanted to train as bike mechanics.
 It followed a similar facility set up in 2015 at Onley Prison in Rugby, which has also seen offenders offered full-time jobs. Halfords said two women had joined the company as cycle mechanics following their release, another two are due to start employment soon and others are expected to follow suit.
 The programme gives offenders the chance to recondition bikes, which are then donated to primary schools. Jonathan Crookall of Halfords says: ""It's about changing people's lives and giving them a second chance. We'd really encourage other businesses to consider supporting offender rehabilitation.""  The falls on Wall Street gathered pace towards the end of trading - with the Dow Jones seeing a big correction after gains earlier this week. Dow Jones closed down 4.15% or 1,033.23 points to 23,860.12. The S&P 500 fell 100.58 points or 3.75% to 2,581. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.9% or 274.82 points at 6,777.16.

It certainly has been a rollercoaster ride for sterling today. The pound is back above the $1.39 level to be up 0.3% at $1.3921. Nine hundred jobs are at risk at three poultry plants that 2 Sisters Food Group says are ""loss-making"". The sites facing closure are Cambuslang in Scotland, with 450 jobs at risk, along with Smethwick and Wolverhampton in England, where 350 and 100 roles are at risk respectively. Scot Walker, a Unite union representative at the Cambuslang plant, said staff were dismayed at news of the possible closure. ""It is far too early to accept that this is the final word,"" he said. Last year an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News found that workers at a 2 Sisters factory in West Bromwich hadchanged slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. The Dow Jones has fallen further in afternoon trading in New York to be down 2.3% or about 570 points, but the broader S&P 500 has shed just 1.5%, or 41 points. Exxon Mobil is the sole riser of the 30 companies on the Dow, with American Express the biggest faller.

Some of the blame for the slide on Wall Street is being attributed to a fall in returns on Treasuries, or US government bonds, if you prefer. Bond prices have weakened in recent days as investors prepared for the likelihood of a stronger US economy and higher inflation, which could lead the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more times than previously anticipated this year. That has all kept equity investors nervous about higher rates and inflation.
    ""Now we are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market. Things haven't quietened down,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer and chief economist at Albion Financial Group. ""As rates rise, things, as far as equity investors are concerned, are getting worse,"" he added. Oops: sterling has now erased almost all of its earlier gains against the dollar to be just 0.1% higher on the day at $1.3893 even. While the London market had a reasonably bad day, and Wall Street looking set to close lower as well, it was worse on the continent: the Cac 40 in Paris and the Dax in Frankfurt tumbled about 2% and 2.6% respectively. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: ""Stocks are offside today as traders undo the positive move from yesterday. Investors remain unconvinced that panic has disappeared from the markets. ""The aftermath of a major decline usually leaves traders in limbo as they fear another leg lower is around the corner, and stocks are selling off.""

Wall Street is heading south again amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve could soon raise interest rates. At lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 460 points,  or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.8% as well. Analysts said higher returns for US government bonds was the reason for Thursday's  drop. US markets have been under pressure all week due to worries the Fed may  accelerate hike rates if inflation rises suddenly.

"Alexanda Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh were the last two members of the cell at large Two British men believed to be members of a notorious Islamic State group cell have been seized by Syrian Kurdish fighters, US officials say. Alexanda Kotey, 34, and El Shafee Elsheikh, 29, were the last two members of the cell to remain at large. The four, all from London, were nicknamed ""the Beatles"" because of their British accents. US officials said the ""execution cell"" had beheaded at least 27 hostages and tortured many more. Families of the men's victims have called for the two seized men to go on trial. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was captured and beheaded by IS - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she wants the men to face life imprisonment. ""Their crimes are beyond imagination,"" she added. This video can not be played Former IS hostage tells Today: I want justice not revenge Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who spent 10 months as an IS captive, also told Today that he wanted justice. He stressed that any attempt to deny the men of their civil rights would only feed IS's claims of victimisation by the West. Mohammed Emwazi - dubbed Jihadi John, was the masked militant from west London who featured in gruesome IS videos, taunting Western powers before beheading hostages. Victims who appeared in those videos included British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. The alleged ringleader of the group, he waskilled in a drone strike in 2015 in Raqqa, the former de facto IS capital in Syria Aine Davis, also from west London, was convicted of being a senior IS member andehe was jailed in Turkey last year on terrorism charges, after being arrested near Istanbul in 2015. Alexanda Kotey, another west Londoner,took part in the torture of hostages, the US State Department says,external, and also acted as a recruiter for IS El Shafee Elsheikh""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"",externalwhile serving as the cell's guard, the US state department says Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? The gangster who ditched drugs for jihad The latest arrests were confirmed by US officials. Officials quoted by US media said the two men had been captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. The UK Foreign Office, meanwhile, said it did not comment on individual cases or investigations. Their capture was first reported by the New York Times,,externalwho noted that American officials had wanted to keep the news secret. The aim was ""to allow analysts more time to pursue the intelligence leads developed from their detention and prepare raids against unsuspecting Islamic State targets"", the newspaper said. The Syrian fighters who apprehended them told US officials in mid-January that the two may have been captured, and the men's identities were later confirmed using fingerprints and other biometric data. The families of the men told the BBC they were not aware of the capture until the story was reported by news organisations. The Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate - its area of control - shrunk rapidly last year. In October, the group lost its ""capital"" of Raqqa to the SDF.In the beginning of November, it lost Deir-al Zour in Syriaon the same day as it lost al-Qaim in Iraq. The Islamic State group has been all but destroyed in Syria The SDF is an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters opposed to IS. The US-backed group has played a key role in driving IS from its strongholds in Syria. The US has said it aims to maintain an open-ended military presence in the country to ensure the jihadist group's defeat. However, the presence of large numbers of Kurdish armed forces in northern Syria has alarmed neighbouring Turkey. Gordon Corera, security correspondent The pair are said to have provided valuable intelligence following their capture. That may be helpful in answering the wider question of what happened to the foreign fighters as the so-called caliphate disintegrated. How many of the thousands of foreign fighters were killed and how many went to other countries or would seek to come home? These men will have been priority targets - but not the only ones. Their capture also raises the issue of what happens next. They could be put on trial in the US, since they were allegedly involved in the killing of US hostages - but there may be some in the Trump administration who would like to send them to Guantanamo Bay. And it is not clear if this is - formally - an issue for the UK Government, as there are reports the pair may have had their UK citizenship stripped from them using powers available to the Home Office.

"Police arrived as the couple were having photos taken in Hinksey Park Newlyweds had a surprise when their wedding pictures were interrupted by a police chase. Toby and Becky Eyre were posing for photos in Oxford's Hinksey Park on Saturday when police arrived. ""At first we just saw a man running and heard police shouting 'stop'... We tried to get out of the way as much as possible,"" said Mr Eyre. Officers made two arrests before returning for photos which were shared on Thames Valley Police's Twitter feed. Mrs Eyre said they had chosen the park for photos as they wanted a quiet moment to celebrate their wedding away from the church and reception. She described how they saw a man come running round the lake and right past them before jumping in the water. They did not see the arrests but police later confirmed two men were held on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs. Mrs Eyre said police saw ""light of the situation"" The bride said the officers were ""focused on the job in hand"" but later saw ""light of the situation"" and drove past to apologise and joined them for a ""free photo shoot"". The story later got ""a few laughs"" when they returned to the wedding reception, Mr Eyre added.

"This video can not be played BBC gains exclusive access to A&E at University Hospital of North Tees Hospital corridors are the new emergency wards, experts say, with growing numbers of patients finding themselves stuck on trolleys because there are no beds for them. The warning comes as figures for the NHS in England showed January was one of the most difficult months on record. Record numbers of seriously-ill patients faced delays waiting for a bed - with 1,000 waiting over 12 hours. It comes despite the mass cancellation of routine treatments to ease pressure. The move was ordered by NHS bosses before Christmas when it became clear hospitals were struggling.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. But the four-hour A&E target was still missed for the 30th month in a row; with 85.3% of patients seen, marginally better than the 85.1% in December. Similar performance is being recorded in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland are doing even worse. A&E stats don't tell full story of a difficult winter Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes However, it was the issue of finding beds that has sparked most alarm. These are known as trolley waits, because patients often find themselves on trolleys in side-rooms and corridors until a bed comes free on a ward. These tend to be the most seriously-ill patients, so doctors decide to admit them on to a ward rather than treat them in A&E. Some 81,000 waited more than four hours for a bed in England - one in five of the 390,000 people who needed to be admitted. Both the four-hour and 12-hour figures for trolley waits were the worst on record - figures go back to 2010. But this does come amid rising numbers of A&E attendances. The data from NHS England shows more than two million patients came to A&E during the month, a rise of more than 5% in a year. Health bosses said with that in mind - and the high levels of flu that have been seen in the worst outbreak since 2011 - the NHS has performed well. Ian Dalton, chief executive at the regulator NHS Improvement, said it was a ""testament"" to the dedication of staff that performance had not declined further. This video can not be played Five secrets of a well-run A&E department But Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said the health service was ""creaking at the seams"". He said the growing number of trolley waits showed ""corridors had become the new emergency wards"". A spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons said: ""These figures show just how tough it was for hospitals this winter despite cancellation of planned surgery to free up capacity. ""Surgeons and other frontline NHS staff are working tirelessly to provide the best care possible to patients. But today's figures show that these short-term measures are insufficient to meet NHS targets.""

"Twitter has reported its first quarterly net profit helped by a rise in video advertising sales. The news gave a massive boost to Twitter's shares which closed 12% up on the day. That was despite the number of people using the social network coming in below expectations. Twitter's previous failure to make a profit had confounded investors given its widespread use and popularity among celebrities and politicians. Net profit was $91.1m (Â£65m) in the fourth quarter of 2017,external, compared with a loss of $167.1m for the same period a year ago. Twitter, which has posted consistent losses since it became a public company in 2013, said it expected to be profitable for the full year of 2018 as well. The company has found success with video and other changes, deepening the experiences on offer, James Erkine, director at marketing firm The Social Circle, told the BBC. ""It's now about taking that scalable model and using it to reach new user groups to increase their user base,"" he said. ""Hopefully now they've made a profit once, they should be able to do it next quarter and carry on doing it."" In October last year, Twitter had suggested a profit was likely as it sought to cut costs, including by slashing stock-based compensation. Revenue in the quarter rose 2% to $732m, as growth internationally offset a decline in the US. User growth, however, remained fairly flat. The firm reported 330 million active users a month, a rise of 4% on last year but no change on the previous quarter. Monthly active users in the US were down to 68 million from 69 million in the third quarter. Twitter said user numbers had been hurt by changes made by Apple to its Safari web browser. A crackdown on fake accounts also contributed to the lacklustre growth, it said. The firm has faced controversy over use of the platform during political events, including Brexit and the 2016 presidential election in America. The firm's shares were trading around $32 per share in mid-morning trade.

"Nearly all local authorities areconcerned for their financial stability, according to a survey carried out by BBC News,which also indicates the majority of local authorities plan to raise council tax, cut spending, or both. Everybody relies on council services to some extent, whether it is bin collection, road maintenance or the local library. But some people rely on services more than others. BBC News spoke to some of them. Many people in East Sussex who have had a stroke rely on a charity - the Stroke Association - to help them rebuild their lives. The organisation currently receives an Â£80,000 grant from the county council - but the local authority recently voted through a Â£17m savings package and a 5.99% council tax rise, which will see a number of frontline services affected. Katie Simpson is a mother of two girls. She had a stroke in 2013 when she was aged 25 and 16 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. ""I had lost feeling in my body, and my speech was starting to slur. ""Doctors had to make the decision whether to save my life or for me to deliver my unborn baby first. I gave birth to my baby son, who was stillborn. ""Scans confirmed I'd had several mini-stokes, and strokes on the left and right side of my brain. ""I had to move back into my parents' home with my two daughters. The stroke left me with severe fatigue, a communication difficulty called aphasia, left-sided weakness in my body, on-going chronic pain, and issues with swallowing which meant I could only eat pureed food like a baby. ""The Stroke Association,externalsupported me when I left hospital, and have continued to support me with many aspects of my life over the past five years. ""My little girls were only four and seven years old. ""I felt like I'd lost my life. It was really difficult. All of a sudden the simple things I'd naturally do with my children were really challenging - you never quite realise how much you actually use your limbs until you lose the power to move them. ""Walking was difficult, cooking, using kitchen utensils, reading a bed time story, trying to help my children get ready for school - it's so sad when you are the adult and you can't do their buttons on their tops or tie their laces. Even putting their hair up was impossible. ""I remember crying because I felt like a failure and that I couldn't help them with such simple things. ""Thanks to support from the Stroke Association I have regular therapy sessions to help with this. ""I owe so much thanks to the Stroke Association for being there for me and my family through my darkest days and bringing me out on the other side."" Northamptonshire County Council is currently consulting on almost Â£35m worth of cuts and plans to close some of its libraries. Rachel McMain is a member of campaign group Save Kingsthorpe Library, which she first used as a child. ""I used to get books there with my grandma and these days I use the library's children's services with my own one-year-old baby. ""I have accessed the service since I was tiny. Now I'm a new mum and if I hadn't have had the library I wouldn't have had the support network that I have now. ""It's not just the children's services, it's people that are vulnerable in the community. It is a place for them to meet, to socialise. ""The council will fund the libraries for one more year before they are taken over by community groups, but for Kingsthorpe it is not great news. ""The council said it would be extremely difficult for Kingsthorpe to be a community-run library but has still decided to make that decision.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has asked the National Audit Office to look into the finances and pay policy of the Motability charity. It follows reports it has Â£2.4bn in reserves and pays its boss Â£1.7m. The charity denies having built up ""spare"" money and says it has provided 4.5m vehicles to disabled people and their families since its 1977 launch. Labour's John Mann, who raised the matter in the Commons, called the cash reserves and pay figures ""grotesque"". He said there needed to be an ""urgent review"" into ""this registered charity, which is funded by a direct grant by the taxpayer through the government"". Ms McVey, answering Mr Mann's urgent question in the House of Commons, told MPs: ""Motability was originally set up 40 years ago with cross-party support. It has done much good in that time. ""But come today, anybody looking at the size of the reserves and pay packages would question the direction Motability has taken in allowing this to happen. ""And with the current focus on corporate governance issues and the use of public money, I have today asked the National Audit Office to give consideration to undertake an investigation into this matter."" After theinitial report in the Daily Mail,externalearlier this week,Motability issued a statement,externaldenying having a ""spare"" Â£2.4bn, saying that the money is not held as cash but is used to buy cars. ""This reduces the amount of borrowing required... underpins the scheme's financial stability, protecting it from the business risks it faces, particularly in relation to used car values,"" it said in the statement. On chief executive Mike Betts' pay, the charity said it was ""reviewed against the market to ensure that it is both competitive over the long term and to ensure that any rewards are related to performance especially in relation to the quality of service provided"". The statement said Motability had an annual turnover of Â£4.2bn, manages a fleet of vehicles worth Â£6.5bn and buys and sells 200,000 cars each year.

"Iain Gilmour had drunk three bottles of wine before being pulled over by police A head teacher who was pulled over after driving through two red lights was almost twice the drink-drive limit and had cocaine. Iain Gilmour, 48, was stopped late at night in Portsmouth on 25 January. He told Portsmouth Magistrates' Court he had been under ""constant"" political and financial pressure at Isambard Brunel Junior School. He was banned from driving for 18 months after admitting drink-driving and possessing a Class A drug. He was also ordered to pay costs and fines totalling Â£1,920. Gilmour, of George Street, Portsmouth, was suspended from his job last Thursday. Isambard Brunel Junior School was given a ""requires improvement"" rating by Ofsted The court heard he was stopped in Manor Road and had half a gram of cocaine which he had purchased for Â£200 earlier that day. The court was told he had drunk three bottles of wine and police recorded his alcohol level as 67mg per 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35mg. Reading from a prepared statement in court, Gilmour said: ""The last couple of years have been incredibly difficult for me. ""As well as constant political and financial changes that all schools face, I have had to face further unique challenges as a head teacher."" He spoke about being affected by the death of a long-standing school colleague from cancer, disappointing exam results in July and being placed on a support programme after an Ofsted inspection. The school was given a""requires improvement"" rating by the education watchdog,externalfollowing an inspection last year. He also revealed he had been battling depression and a recent dependency on alcohol. ""I was in such a state on the night of my arrest when I compounded my stupidity by giving into a desire for something stronger. My subsequent actions have destroyed my career,"" he said. The school, which is currently being led by the deputy head, said Gilmour was ""suspended immediately"" when the allegations came to light and it would be starting disciplinary procedures. Gilmour apologised to his family and the school and said he was seeking help to fight his ""personal demons"".

"This video can not be played ""Nobody welcomes a tax rise"" Nearly all local authorities in England are set to raise council tax and service charges amid concerns for their financial stability, a survey suggests. Council tax is set to rise in 95% of authorities while 93% will hike service fees, according to the 2018 State of Local Government Finance research. The planned increases come as 80% of councils fear for their balance sheets. Last week, Northamptonshire County Council banned all new spending and saidits financial future was ""grave"". Council tax can rise by 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, althoughthe largest authorities are to be allowed to increase it by up to 5.99%. Local authorities also oversee charges for services such as parking, burials and planning and 93% of respondents to the survey indicated new or increased fees in order to make ends meet. 'What council tax has done for me' Central government funding has come under fire as a result, with councils said to be calling for a ""fundamental redesign of the financial system"". The research -carried out by the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) think tank and The Municipal Journal,external- claims the biggest pressure on authorities' budgets is children's services (nearly 32% of councils), then adult social care (close to 28%) and housing and homelessness (19%). In the 113 councils that responded to the survey, a third of all those in England, social care was found to be the greatest long-term pressure. Additionally, councils are uncertain about what monies they will receive after 2020 as decisions over business rates and theFair Funding Review,externalare yet to be decided, the report found. Of those 113 respondents, just six said they would not raise council tax. Of those six, onlyEast Hampshire District Council agreed to be identified. Early Briton had dark skin and blue eyes UK 'could adopt' Norway recycling system Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 degree On Friday, it emerged Northamptonshire County Council had imposed emergency controls on its spending in order to address ""severe financial challenges"". The move, known as a section 114 notice, is issued when a council does not have enough money to meet its expenditure. It is the first local authority in 20 years to resort to the measure. The Conservative-run council has projected overspend of Â£21.1m for 2017-18 and its chief financial officer warned predictions for the following year were ""grave"". On Tuesday, Surrey County Council (SCC) agreed a 6% rise in its council tax in the face of a Â£105m funding gap, according to analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism,as reported in The Times.,external In February 2017, the Tory-led authority threatened to impose a 15% increase in council tax in order to deal with its deficit - which would have triggered a referendum - but then found itself at the centre ofa political row over a so-called ""sweetheart deal""from the government. Analysis by Daniel Wainwright, BBC England data journalist How much you pay in council tax depends on where you live and how expensive your house would have been when the system was first drawn up, in 1991. Police and crime commissioners and fire authorities all add to the bill and in areas with county, district and parish councils, each tier of local government will have its own precept. Band A homes, those that would have been of the lowest value, will pay the least and Band H will pay the most. When all these bills and different bands of housing are taken into account, eight of the 10 areas with the highest average council tax bills are in Surrey. People in the Elmbridge district will pay almost Â£2,000 per home. Despite this, the county council is still facing a Â£105 million funding gap. While London is known for being expensive, particularly when it comes to housing, it has some of the lowest council tax bills in the country. People in Wandsworth pay an average of Â£645 a year per household. In Westminster,where the average property price is more than Â£1 million,external, people pay an average of Â£724 a year. A spokesman for SCC, which serves the UK's richest county in terms of high net-worth individuals, said: ""We've been successfully managing the growing need for adult social care, children's and other key services partly through making savings of Â£540m since 2010 and have made sure we keep within our overall budget."" Councils in England get their money from: Council tax Taxes paid by local businesses Central government grants - some (like education) is ring-fenced Rent from social housing Fees and charges, such as for parking The money is then spent on: Adult social care Children's services Transport and highways Housing Waste collection and recycling Community safety and crime reduction Cultural services like libraries Cremations and burials Source: BBC Reality Check Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, claimed the survey showed that councils ""are on the edge"" and most are ""holding it together"" by ""raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves"". ""Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change,"" he said. In Scotland, council tax policy is the responsibility of the Holyrood government but the 32 local councils set the rates and collect the duties. Authorities were discouraged from increasing rates for a period of nine years via the threat of financial penalties, but this central freeze was ended in 2017. Most councils have now opted to raise taxes by up to the 3% permitted. In Wales, the Welsh Government settlement assumes a rise of 2.5% in council tax on average. There is no official cap, but there is an informal limit of 5% which was set ministers. So far, this has not been exceeded, although last monthPembrokeshire County Council said it was considering a rise of 12.5%. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, the body which speaks for local councils, added that some authorities are ""perilously close"" to financial collapse. Council budgets: One in three spent more than planned Council spend on agency social workers doubles The rules that govern council tax increases ""Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps,"" he said. ""Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face. Local authority finances are ""on the edge"" and ""perilously close"" to failure, it is claimed ""This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result."" A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said its finance settlement ""strikes a balance"" between relieving pressure on councils and ensuring taxpayers ""do not face excessive bills"". ""Overall, councils will see a real-term increase in resources over the next two years, more freedom and fairness and with a greater certainty to plan and secure value for money,"" he said. He added that more control had also been given to councils over the business rates they raise locally so ""millions of pounds"" could stay in communities.

"The inquest heard Richard Handley vomited and choked A ""missed opportunity"" for potentially life-saving treatment contributed to the death of a man from constipation complications, an inquest has found. Richard Handley, 33, who had Down's syndrome, died at Ipswich Hospital on 17 November 2012. Some 10kg (22lb) of faeces were removed from his body two days before. Coroner Dr Peter Dean said there were ""gross failures"" in spotting Mr Handley was in a critical state after the surgery. After an 11-day inquest at Ipswich Coroners' Court, Dr Dean said an overall care co-ordinator ""would have prevented this from happening"" as there were a number of agencies involved in looking after Mr Handley. Mr Handley's mother Sheila, who gave evidence during the inquest, said outside court she was ""disappointed"" after the coroner's verdict. ""With hearing about the gross failures identified and missed opportunities spoken of I find it very hard to understand how the coroner didn't feel able to use the word 'neglect' in his conclusion,"" she said. ""It feels to me, having heard all the evidence, that the level of the failures was such that Richard died because he was neglected. He wasn't given the care he needed to keep him safe."" Mr Handley was admitted to Ipswich Hospital on 14 November 2012 Chief executive of The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, Nick Hulme, said: ""I am extremely sorry that we let Richard and his family down in the last 48 hours of his life. ""I want to give my personal assurance that we have learned from this tragedy and improved the care and support we provide for people with learning disabilities and patients whose health is rapidly deteriorating."" Mr Handley died as a result of choking on his own vomit having inhaled gastric contents following complications with surgery. The coroner said there were missed opportunities to alert more senior staff to his condition. Mr Handley was admitted to hospital on 14 November after his family became concerned with his distended abdomen,which made him look ""full-term pregnant"". He had an operation to remove the faecal matter the following day. The inquest heard Mr Handley was a ""much-loved member"" of his family Mr Handley was born with moderate learning disabilities and bowel problems and family members said they provided daily laxatives and a high-fibre diet to alleviate his constipation. He was moved to a care home in Lowestoft in 1999, which was turned into a supported living complex in 2009. This resulted in changes to his diet and a reduction in monitoring his bowel movements, leading to his constipation worsening. The coroner said this was the start of a chain of events that led to his death and without them his ""death would not have occurred"". Tim Cooper, from United Response, which ran the home where Mr Handley lived, said the organisation ""could and should have done better"". ""The coroner has concluded today that everyone involved in his care acted in good faith to assist him at all times, but it's clear that we collectively failed Richard,"" he said. ""We are incredibly sorry for Richard's death. Situations like his are rare but there are lessons for each organisation to learn from and act upon to provide truly integrated support for those with learning disabilities in the future."" Richard Handley's family had told the inquest his death was ""wholly preventable"" Julie Cave, chief executive of Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT), said it ""fully accepts"" the conclusions of the coroner. She added: ""Since the publication of a serious case review in 2015, NSFT has made significant improvements to the services we provide to people with learning disabilities who also experience mental illness."" Mike Hennessey, Suffolk County Council director for adult care, said it had ""already taken significant steps to address the recommendations of the serious case review"". He said: ""Alongside all organisations involved, we are fully committed to further work to improve the health and social care services provided to people with learning disabilities in Suffolk."" Inquest, the charity which provides expertise on state related deaths and their investigation, worked with Mr Handley's family. It said ""most so called 'natural cause' deaths of people with learning disabilities... are not afforded proper scrutiny and never have an inquest"" It praised the family for their ""persistent fight for answers"".

"Police arrived as the couple were having photos taken in Hinksey Park Newlyweds had a surprise when their wedding pictures were interrupted by a police chase. Toby and Becky Eyre were posing for photos in Oxford's Hinksey Park on Saturday when police arrived. ""At first we just saw a man running and heard police shouting 'stop'... We tried to get out of the way as much as possible,"" said Mr Eyre. Officers made two arrests before returning for photos which were shared on Thames Valley Police's Twitter feed. Mrs Eyre said they had chosen the park for photos as they wanted a quiet moment to celebrate their wedding away from the church and reception. She described how they saw a man come running round the lake and right past them before jumping in the water. They did not see the arrests but police later confirmed two men were held on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs. Mrs Eyre said police saw ""light of the situation"" The bride said the officers were ""focused on the job in hand"" but later saw ""light of the situation"" and drove past to apologise and joined them for a ""free photo shoot"".

"Same-sex marriages on Bermuda-registered cruise lines like Cunard and P&O Cruises will be outlawed The UK government has said it would not be ""appropriate"" to block Bermuda's decision to repeal same-sex marriage. On Wednesday the British overseas territory became the first country in the world to pass, and then revoke, the law, replacing gay marriage with domestic partnerships. The decision also means cruise ships registered in Bermuda are likely to be banned from hosting same-sex weddings. Theresa May said the UK's dealings with Bermuda should be based on ""respect"". But critics say the law reversal will make the UK an international ""laughing stock"". The Atlantic island, which is home to 60,000 people, legalised marriage between homosexual couples in May 2017, following a Supreme Court ruling. Gay marriage: First couples wed in Australia NI Secretary Karen Bradley rejects same-sex marriage call California judge sides with baker in 'gay cake' row But thenew Domestic Partnership Act,external, approved by Bermuda Governor John Rankin on Wednesday, rolls back the legalisation. Instead of marriage, the act allows gay or straight couples to form a partnership, which the Bermuda government says carries equivalent rights. According to Bermuda's minister of home affairs, Walton Brown, the majority of Bermudians do not agree with gay couples marrying. He said: ""The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples."" Because of Bermuda's status as an overseas dependent territory, the UK government had the power to block the law change. But Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told MPs: ""After full and careful consideration in regards to Bermuda's constitutional and international obligations, the Secretary decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to use this power to block legislation, which can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional circumstances."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""seriously disappointed"" about the decision to abolish same-sex marriage. But she added: ""That bill has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government."" MPs on all sides criticised the decision and called it a backward step. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the law reversal will make Britain a ""laughing stock in the international human rights field"".

""Gay and lesbian Bermudians have been told that they aren't quite equal to everyone else."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The problem, as many MPs pointed out, is that Britain may now find it harder to promote LGBT rights around the world when it has failed to do so in one of its own overseas territories."" The cruise companies Cunard and P&O Cruises, both of which register their ships in Bermuda, said they were ""very unhappy"" about the change in legislation, which will outlaw same-sex marriage ceremonies on their liners. ""We do not underestimate the disappointment this will cause those guests who have planned their weddings,"" the companies said in an identically-worded statement.

"MPs found to have bullied or harassed their staff will have to write a letter of apology and undergo training, under new proposals. In more serious cases, they could be suspended or forced to face a public vote on their future. The plans were drawn up by a cross-party committee after widespread allegations of sexual harassment. At the moment, MPs don't have any formal disciplinary procedures. Discipline is handled by their parties and there are no independent channels for staff to raise complaints about their behaviour. MPs' staff tell of bullying and abuse Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, who chaired the committee, said: ""This is a major step in bringing about the culture change that Parliament needs."" She acknowledged how difficult it was for MPs to be ejected from Parliament under the current rules, given how many had continued to sit after admitting, or being found guilty of, misconduct. ""It's for individual perpetrators to make a decision on whether to resign or retire,"" she told MPs. ""But it is absolutely the intention of this new procedure that they will and can be forced to do so, regardless of who they are and what their role is."" The committee also wants MPs to be given mandatory training in appropriate behaviour in the workplace, which would start after the next general election. ""Consent training"" and lessons in how to recruit staff and avoid ""unconscious bias"" will also be made available. This video can not be played Kate Maltby tells Today there needs to be ""political will"" to change attitudes towards harassment in Parliament Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who sat on the committee, rejected claims that training was unnecessary because MPs should already be aware of how to behave towards staff and colleagues. ""The MPs who are kicking up the most fuss about the training are precisely the ones who should be first in the queue for it,"" she told BBC News. She also defended plans to grant anonymity to both the accusers and alleged perpetrators, amid claims that keeping the identity of an offender secret could prevent other alleged victims from coming forward. The committee had wanted to ensure complainants were ""given the power in this process"", she said, but ""it doesn't take very much investigation"" to work out the identity of an accuser if the MP employing them is named. If the most serious sanctions were applied, the identity of the alleged perpetrator would be made public, under the committee's proposals. This video can not be played The complainant can ""seek justice without having their names splashed across the newspapers"" says Mrs Leadsom MPs are in a ""constant media spotlight"" and ""checks and balances"" were needed to guard against ""vexatious"" complaints, the report said. Under the new proposals, which will also apply to members of the House of Lords, a trained sexual violence adviser will be appointed to handle complaints. The adviser would lead an ""informal"" resolution process, which could result in a written apology for the complainant or workplace training for the perpetrator. Complainants would be given ""practical and emotional"" support, whether or not they decide to take the matter to the police or pursue their claim. In more serious cases, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner would investigate and recommend the suspension of an MP or peer for a specified period. This could trigger proceedings for recall of an MP - resulting in a new election in his or her constituency - or the expulsion of a peer, under procedures introduced in 2014 by the coalition government. The committee also called for a new code of behaviour, independent of the political parties, applying to everyone on the Parliamentary estate, including visitors. In a survey carried out by the MPs' working group more than 250 people said they had seen or experienced sexual harassment in the past year. The survey, which got 1,377 responses, or 17% of the Westminster workforce, found that as well as 19% reporting experience of sexual harassment, 39% had experienced non-sexual harassment or bullying in the past 12 months. It was ""unacceptable"" that such ""inappropriate behaviours"" have taken place across the ""parliamentary community"", the report added. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said she hoped the report would create a ""safe and secure and constructive workplace"" for everyone working at Westminster. The SNP's Pete Wishart, who also helped draw up the recommendations, said he hoped they would ""signal the end of the poisonous patriarchal culture that has characterised so many of the relationships in this House"". The proposals will be debated by MPs later this month.

"A ban on puppy sales by pet shops and other third-party dealers in England is being considered by the government. Under the proposals, people buying or adopting a dog would deal directly with a breeder or rehousing centre. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the plan would be examined as part of a new package of measures aimed at driving up welfare standards. Enhanced licensing conditions for breeders are already due to come into force this year. Under the new rules, breeders or sellers of dogs must be licensed and will not be able to sell puppies and kittens under eight weeks old. Puppies must also be shown alongside their mother before a sale is made, and - amid concern over online sales - purchases must be completed in the presence of the new owner. Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested a ban on third-party sales could lead to the creation of an illegal market. But the Dogs Trust welcomed the government's latest thinking on the issue, which is subject to aconsultation.,external Paula Boyden, veterinary director for the Dogs Trust, said: ""If a ban was introduced now, puppy farmers could exploit loopholes such as setting themselves up as unregulated re-homing centres or sanctuaries. ""Licensing and inspection of dog breeders and sellers must also be stronger to ensure that everyone involved in the trade is on the radar of local authorities."" RSPCA deputy chief executive Chris Wainwright said: ""We have always said that an end to third party sales alone would not be enough to end the puppy trade crisis, and we are pleased that this is being looked at alongside enhanced licensing conditions for breeders."" The RSPCA said many breeders are putting profit ahead of the health and welfare of dogs The charity's chief inspector Ian Briggs said officers had found dogs and puppies ""covered in filth"" while kept in cold, damp pens with no light by breeders and dealers involved in the underground puppy trade. He said: ""We've also found tiny puppies kept in buckets amongst the dead bodies of their siblings."" The Mayhew Animal Home charity highlighted the case of Luna, a Jack Russell terrier who was sold online despite being ill with a suspected skin disease. At six weeks old, Luna was already under the legal age required for puppies to be sold - but the seller claimed the young dog was 10 weeks old. Jack Russell terrier Luna was illegally sold underage online A Mayhew spokeswoman said the new rules, due to come into force at the end of October, will ban third-party sales like in Luna's case. And Mayhew's chief executive Caroline Yates said: ""Getting a dog or cat is not a commercial business and the big puppy farms have no regard for the health or welfare of animals. ""Owners are being duped into buying animals from these places."" In another case, the Dogs Trust said a French bulldog called Lola was forced to travel from eastern Europe so her puppies could be born and sold in the UK at a higher price. Two of her puppies later died. ""The law is not protecting these dogs and we need to be absolutely sure that future legislation is properly resourced and enforceable,"" the charity said.

"Twitter has reported its first quarterly net profit helped by a rise in video advertising sales. The news gave a massive boost to Twitter's shares which closed 12% up on the day. That was despite the number of people using the social network coming in below expectations. Twitter's previous failure to make a profit had confounded investors given its widespread use and popularity among celebrities and politicians. Net profit was $91.1m (Â£65m) in the fourth quarter of 2017,external, compared with a loss of $167.1m for the same period a year ago. Twitter, which has posted consistent losses since it became a public company in 2013, said it expected to be profitable for the full year of 2018 as well. The company has found success with video and other changes, deepening the experiences on offer, James Erkine, director at marketing firm The Social Circle, told the BBC. ""It's now about taking that scalable model and using it to reach new user groups to increase their user base,"" he said. ""Hopefully now they've made a profit once, they should be able to do it next quarter and carry on doing it."" In October last year, Twitter had suggested a profit was likely as it sought to cut costs, including by slashing stock-based compensation. Revenue in the quarter rose 2% to $732m, as growth internationally offset a decline in the US. User growth, however, remained fairly flat. The firm reported 330 million active users a month, a rise of 4% on last year but no change on the previous quarter. Monthly active users in the US were down to 68 million from 69 million in the third quarter. Twitter said user numbers had been hurt by changes made by Apple to its Safari web browser. A crackdown on fake accounts also contributed to the lacklustre growth, it said. The firm has faced controversy over use of the platform during political events, including Brexit and the 2016 presidential election in America. The firm's shares were trading around $32 per share in mid-morning trade.

"This video can not be played BBC gains exclusive access to A&E at University Hospital of North Tees Hospital corridors are the new emergency wards, experts say, with growing numbers of patients finding themselves stuck on trolleys because there are no beds for them. The warning comes as figures for the NHS in England showed January was one of the most difficult months on record. Record numbers of seriously-ill patients faced delays waiting for a bed - with 1,000 waiting over 12 hours. It comes despite the mass cancellation of routine treatments to ease pressure. The move was ordered by NHS bosses before Christmas when it became clear hospitals were struggling.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. But the four-hour A&E target was still missed for the 30th month in a row; with 85.3% of patients seen, marginally better than the 85.1% in December. Similar performance is being recorded in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland are doing even worse. A&E stats don't tell full story of a difficult winter Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes However, it was the issue of finding beds that has sparked most alarm. These are known as trolley waits, because patients often find themselves on trolleys in side-rooms and corridors until a bed comes free on a ward. These tend to be the most seriously-ill patients, so doctors decide to admit them on to a ward rather than treat them in A&E. Some 81,000 waited more than four hours for a bed in England - one in five of the 390,000 people who needed to be admitted. Both the four-hour and 12-hour figures for trolley waits were the worst on record - figures go back to 2010. But this does come amid rising numbers of A&E attendances. The data from NHS England shows more than two million patients came to A&E during the month, a rise of more than 5% in a year. Health bosses said with that in mind - and the high levels of flu that have been seen in the worst outbreak since 2011 - the NHS has performed well. Ian Dalton, chief executive at the regulator NHS Improvement, said it was a ""testament"" to the dedication of staff that performance had not declined further. This video can not be played Five secrets of a well-run A&E department But Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said the health service was ""creaking at the seams"". He said the growing number of trolley waits showed ""corridors had become the new emergency wards"". A spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons said: ""These figures show just how tough it was for hospitals this winter despite cancellation of planned surgery to free up capacity. ""Surgeons and other frontline NHS staff are working tirelessly to provide the best care possible to patients. But today's figures show that these short-term measures are insufficient to meet NHS targets.""

"The fire broke out shortly after 22:00 GMT Wednesday An 18th Century water mill that used to supply paper for the Bank of England has been gutted by fire.

"Why watch the Winter Olympics - surely just a collection of incomprehensible sports events that Britain - a country regularly destabilised by a few centimetres of snow - is no good at? Or is it an adrenaline-filled ride into the unknown, where you just don't know what you'll be entranced by next? Here are eight things we predict will capture the imagination at Pyeongchang 2018. Great Britain's Eve Muirhead throws a stone in the Sochi Winter Olympics 2014 What is curling? If you were to invent a sport from scratch, you would probably end up suggesting monkey tennis before you'd get to the slightly strange hotpotch that is curling. Experts may talk of curling stones, the skip, the house and the brushes - but ask any non-aficionado and they'll describe it as bowls on ice with added broomstick action. A lot of broomstick action. Few would mark this combination out as a surefire TV winner but, every four years, it becomes one of the most mesmerising things you can watch on a TV screen. It's now 16 years since more than six million viewers stayed on watching past midnight as British curlers Rhona Martin, Debbie Knox, Janice Rankin and Fiona MacDonald secured the gold medal in Salt Lake City. If nothing else, use it as inspiration to get on with your spring clean. After taking in a exciting curling showdown, you'll find that you'll be wielding your brush, broom or mop around your floors with unexpected vigour. South Korean artist Psy gave K-Pop an international reach This year's games are being held in South Korea, and with it there is likely to be a pyrotechnic extravaganza full of bubblegum K-Pop. For those notau faitwith this particular genre of music (ie anyone over 25), think R&B meets Vengaboys. It's tacky, highly stylised, and infectiously brilliant. Any aficionado of the Eurovision Song Contest will enjoy the choreographed moves and caffeinated energy of K-Pop. The details of who will be performing have been shrouded in secrecy but everyone is hoping the Mr Gangnam Style himself, Psy, will make an appearance. The opening ceremony will be broadcast on Friday Pita Taufatofua at the Rio Olympics 2016 Back in the heat of the Maracana stadium at the opening of the Rio Olympics, Tongan flag bearer Pita Taufatofua raised temperatures even more with his choice of attire. The Taekwondo athlete entered the arena bare-chested and visibly oiled up in a rather minimalist ceremonial outfit. And the good news for those who immediately adopted him as a cult hero is that he is back for the Winter Olympics as he's switched the dojang for the ski slopes. The 34-year-oldwill be competing in cross-country skiing, and is the first person from Tonga to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Don't expect big things on the slopes - Taufatofua only saw snow for the first time a couple of years ago. Butdoexpect big things at the opening ceremony. Temperatures will be a lot lower, meaning the same outfit is unlikely, but this is a man who knows how to make an entrance. Team GB's Amanda Lightfoot cross-country skiing, with a gun attached to her back Great Britain's team for 2018 Winter Olympics The biathlon combines two of the most bourgeois and middle-class pursuits known to man: skiing and shooting. Generally in life, opportunities to show off your aptitude at cross-country ski-ing and shooting a rifle at the same time are limited, unless you're trying to hunt down a Yukon moose in the dead of winter - or on a mission for Her Majesty's Secret Service tracking a tricky Russian villain. Sadly, James Bond has failed to make the British team, possibly because jumping off the edge of a cliff and deploying a Union Jack parachute contravened Olympic regulations. But Amanda Lightfoot will be competing for Team GB in the women's 7.5km sprint, surely hoping to avoid any kind of Ski-fall. Lizzy Yarnold competing at the BMW IBSF World Cup Skeleton in Koenigssee, Germany What is skeleton? Sometimes I have a waking nightmare that I am hurtling down a mountain at 80mph (130km/h), with my face only inches away from a rock hard sheet of ice. It turns out that's a sport, and Team GB has had some incredible successes in it. Possibly because not everyone in the world can be convinced to give it a go. In 2010 Amy Williams,externalwon the women's skeleton gold for Britain, as didLizzy Yarnold in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Yarnold will return to the skeleton track in Pyeongchang alongside Laura Deas, Dom Parsons, and Jerry Rice. This video can not be played 'We're all goofballs' - meet the first African bobsleigh team at a Winter Olympics Even those who have never watched the Winter Olympics coverage have seen the film Cool Runnings, the Disney caper based on the real life story of the 1988 Jamaican bobsleigh team. Thirty years on the Jamaican women's team have qualified for the bobsleigh, but there's an even more historic breakthrough to keep a close eye on. The Nigerian bobsleigh team will become the first team from the African continent to compete in the truly whizzbang event, which may look like fun but requires guiding a sled at speeds of up to 150kph (90mph) down a particularly perilous track. Everyone loves a heart-warming underdog story, and these two teams will be cheered by millions. Torvill and Dean performing to the Bolero in the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics What is figure skating? To younger audiences, Torvill and Dean are the judges that get the fewest boos on Dancing on Ice, but in 1984 the pair set the ice on fire (metaphorically speaking) at the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. Get a perfect set of sixes and you're guaranteed to be more popular than Jason Gardiner for the rest of your life. Penny Coomes and Nick Buckland are the British pair out in South Korea doing their best to recreate that Torvill and Dean magic and perhaps secure their spots on the judging panel in the future. For Dancing On Ice fans, it'll be a good opportunity to compare the likes of Donna Air and Kem Cetinay with full-time athletes who are striving for a gold medal rather than merely avoiding the skate-off. And if you see any dancers you particularly like the look of... let Dancing On Ice know. Winter sports are fast and furious - and flawed. As great as it is when it goes right, the more memorable moments are when it goes wrong. And in the Winter Olympics there's always a proliferation of pratfalls, by virtue of the fact that competitors are airborne or on slippery surfaces 100% of the time.

"The participation of 22 North Korean athletes at the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics has captured the world's attention. The contingent, comprising skaters, skiers and ice hockey players, arrived in South Korea in two batches. What do we know about them? North Korean figure skaters have won laurels at recent international events Figure skating pair Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik are thought to be the North's best hope for a medal as the only athletes who qualified for the Games on merit. They have trained with Canadian coach Bruno Marcotte and are expected to perform to a cover version of the Beatles song ""A Day in the Life"", according to the official website of the Pyeongchang Olympics. Coaching North Korea's figure skaters in Canada North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive Ryom turned 19 on 2 February and enjoys music, dancing and reading. Her skating partner Kim, 25, is interested in football. In January, the duo came third at the International Skating Union (ISU) Four Continents Figure Skating Championships held in Taiwan. The annual event hosted athletes from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania (non-European countries). This was North Korea's first medal at an ISU-sanctioned event. They also won bronze at the 2017 Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan. The couple are said to befriendly,externalwith the South Korean team of Kim Kyu-eun and Kam Kang-chan, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. They all met in Montreal last year during their summer training. The rivals seem to be bonding as Kim Kyu-eun gave cosmetics and the two mascots of the Pyeongchang Olympics to Ryom for her birthday. The Korean women hockey players will compete as one team in the Pyeongchang Olympics Twelve female ice hockey players from North Korea are taking part at the Pyeongchang Olympics, which is the first unified Korean team for any sport at the Olympics. The move has been criticised by some in South Korea who feel that their athletes have lost the opportunity to play so players from the North could be accommodated. Canadian coach Sarah Murray also expressed reservations about the unified team initially. ""It's exciting to be a part of something that's so historic, to have two countries so divided come together through sports... But at the same time, it's mixed feelings because it's at the expense of... we don't get to play our full roster"", she said at a news conference in late January. She is hopeful about the joint team's prospects though it lost a friendly match against Sweden on 4 February. Four North Korean players - Jong Su-hyon, Kim Un-hyang and Ryo Song-hui and Hwang Chung-gum - played in the exhibition match. And language is creating communication hurdles as Korean has developed differently in both countries. Ms Murray talked about some of these difficulties in comments to reporters. ""Something that I didn't even think about is North Korean is different than South Korean, the language. So for our team meetings, it is going through to English to South Korean to North Korean. So the meetings take three times as long. It is really hard when you have three different languages in one team,"" she said. Ice hockey is a fast-paced game and the use of different hockey terms by both sides could affect co-ordination, reports have said. Skiers from both Koreas recently trained at the Masikryong ski resort in North Korea North Korea has also sent two short track speed skaters, three alpine skiers and three cross-country skiers to compete at the Olympics. However, it has not been a good start for the short trackers, Choe Un-song and Jong Kwang-bom. Choe, 25, sustained an injury in his right leg during a practice session last week. It is not clear whether he will be able to take part in the Olympic events. Skiers from both Koreas recently trained together for two days at the North's Masikryong Ski Resort. The alpine skiers in the delegation are Choe Myong-gwang, Kang Song-il and Kim Ryon-hyang while the cross-country skiers are Han Chun-gyong, Pak Il-chol and Ri Yong-gum. South Korean media says the athletes have been keeping a low profile. Figure skater Ryom has been one of the few to respond to reporters' questions, though briefly, and has also smiled at the cameras. Asked to comment on her visit, she simply said, ""I don't talk before competitions"" and added that ""it's cold here"".

"People wave a unified Korea flag during a joint Korean women's hockey match It is not unusual for the Olympic Games to take place with a heated political backdrop. But these Winter Olympics, in the mountainous Pyeongchang region of South Korea, are happening in particularly intriguing circumstances. We've condensed the story down to 100 words and 500 words - you can read each individually or one after the other. The Games are happening only 80km (50 miles) from the North Korean border and come at a time of heightened concerns over the North's military capabilities. After several missile and nuclear tests, there are fears North Korea, an autocratic, unpredictable state, may now have a nuclear weapon they're able to fit on a missile - one that could reach the US. Leader Kim Jong-un has also been engaged in a war of words with Donald Trump - a key ally to South Korea. But there's been a warming of ties between North and South before the Games. How long will that last? The Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are taking place in a country still technically at war with its neighbour, which is only 80km (50 miles) from the Games venue. In reality though, they're not in a state of war - neither side was able to claim victory after the 1950-53 Korean War, so they agreed a ceasefire. Relations between the two remain fraught. But South Korea's president Moon Jae-in has said the Games are a ""precious opportunity"" to seek peace on the Korean peninsula, and has called these Games the ""Peace Olympics"". North Korean ice hockey player Choe Un-gyong cuts her birthday cake as North and South Korean teammates look on Both countries will walk together under the same unified flag, and are fielding a joint women's hockey team. The Korean peninsula has been divided since the end of World War Two. The North is an autocratic state of 25m people, largely isolated from the world, headed by Kim Jong-un. The South is a thriving democratic state of about 51m people that is a key US ally. Officially, both countries support unification. But their visions of what a unified Korea would look like are very different. North Korea, insisting it has the right to defend itself, has pushed ahead in recent years with developing a nuclear programme and producing ever more advanced missiles. In 2017, it conducted its sixth nuclear test and also tested intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US. North Korea also said it could now place a miniaturised nuclear weapon on top of a missile. North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy The US has installed a missile defence system in South Korea - its presence there has infuriated the North. Last year also saw a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump, who threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea in a UN speech. In a surprise move, Kim Jong-un extended a rare olive branch to the South in his new year's speech, saying he was willing to send a team to the Games. This was noteworthy as there hasn't been much co-operation between the countries under the past two governments in South Korea. The North also boycotted the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, so its willingness to travel to Pyeongchang is significant. After Mr Kim's speech, the North agreed to send a 500-strong delegation to the Games -his sister, Kim Yo-jong, was among the officials to visit. The warmer ties have been welcomed, but there's been plenty of scepticism too. Hong Joon-pyo, leader of South Korea's main opposition party, said the government ""is being dragged around by Kim Jong-un's false peace offensive and political show"". Inside the world's most secretive country Japan's foreign minister said North Korea was using the Games as a chance to improve its image, while continuing its missile and nuclear programmes regardless. ""It's not the time to ease pressure towards North Korea,"" Taro Kono said. Meanwhile, the signs that North Korea is happy to continue provoking its critics are still there - it moved its traditional military display forward two months, to the eve of the Games.

"When Mark Carney channelled his inner Gwyneth Paltrow and wondered aloud when the UK might ""consciously recouple"" with the global economy, he was sending a delicate signal wrapped in some Hollywood glamour. Today, that delicate signal - first given in a BBC interview the Governor of the Bank of England gave last month - became a lot stronger. Global growth is continuing at a rate not seen since 2011. All the vital economic engines - America, China, continental Europe and Japan - are, if not exactly purring, exuding a level of confidence which has put the Bank in a more positive mood. The European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator is close to a 17 year high. Growth in China was faster in 2017 compared with 2016. The US is seeing a jobs boom. We are an exporting nation - more than 25% of everything we make we sell abroad. If ""abroad"" is doing well, we do well. The Bank has upgraded growth for the UK for this year and next. Employment rates are at record levels and wage growth is slowly returning. Business investment is up. Now, this benign environment does contain risks. As demand increases globally, inflationary pressures rise. Oil prices are up. Commodity prices for things like metals are up. Rising wages in the UK increases the risk of domestic inflation taking hold. The Bank is wary. Inflation is still 1% above the 2% target set by the Government. It was willing to ""look through"" that issue whilst the economy still needed the support of hyper-low interest rates. That willingness has waned. Today the Bank warned that interest rates are likely to increase earlier this year than expected and then more often after that than previously anticipated. The chances of the next interest rate rise happening in May have risen considerably. The chances of another rate rise in 2019 and 2020 have also increased. Let's not forget - the present very low rates are unconventional and allowing inflation to float above target is also against the norm. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise. And savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Consumer confidence is also soft, affected by the incomes squeeze which has seen earnings not rising as fast as inflation. There are two big points from today's Inflation Report, the Bank's three monthly health check on the UK economy. Growth is better. And the risk of interest rate rises has risen.

"The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, official figures say. Economists had expected a 0.4% expansion in the three months to December. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the broader picture was ""slower and more uneven"" growth. In 2017 as a whole, growth was 1.8% compared with 1.9% in 2016 - the slowest since 2012, the ONS said. The services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, expanded by 0.6% in the fourth quarter - stronger than the 0.4% rise in the three months to September. ""The boost to the economy at the end of the year came from a range of services including recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management,"" said Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS. Carney calls for 'deeper relationship' with Europe Mortgage approvals at five-year low Yet consumer-facing parts of the services sector, which include distribution, hotels, catering, transport and communications, posted much slower growth, he said. Manufacturing also grew strongly, but construction contracted by 1% - its third consecutive fall and worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2012. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said construction appeared to be the sector most affected by Brexit-related uncertainty, deterring commercial property investment and dampening the housing market, particularly in London. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the ""undeniably strong"" quarterly figures increased the chance of the Monetary Policy Committee raising interest rates again as soon as this summer. However, Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell described growth as anaemic and doubted there would be more than one rate rise this year, ""probably in the autumn"". Sterling jumped 0.8% to $1.4253 following the release of the GDP figures. Choose your comparator. You might, like Bank of England governor Mark Carney, point out that the economy is about 1% smaller than the Bank predicted it would be before the Brexit vote. But that was in the event of a ""stay"" vote. Pro-Brexit critics might point out the economy is doing a lot better than his own warnings about the risk of a ""technical recession"" if the UK voted to leave. Annual growth of 1.8% may be less than we would like, but so far there is little sign of the Brexit-induced disaster that some predicted.

"The Freemasons have placed full-page advertisements in several national newspapers calling for an end to the ""discrimination"" against their members. The United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) said it welcomes individuals from all walks of life but that members are ""undeservedly stigmatised"". It said it had written to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Recent news stories questioned the influence of Freemasons in policing and in parliament. In an advert in the Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian, the governing body of Freemasonry complains of the ""gross misrepresentation"" of its members. Under the headline ""Enough is enough"", chief executive Dr David Staples said the organisation raised more than Â£33m for good causes last year. The secret ceremonies and rituals of female Freemasons He said people of any race, faith, age, class or political persuasion were welcome in the 300-year-old organisation. The United Grand Lodge of England is restricted to men, although separate women-only lodges also exist. There are about six million Freemasons worldwide and more than 200,000 in the UK under the United Grand Lodge of England There are about 4,700 female Freemasons in the UK and 200,000 male Freemasons in England and Wales with more under the Grand Lodge of Scotland Freemasons meet in a temple, which they call a ""lodge"", as it is understood that is where ancient stonemasons met when working on a church or cathedral Lodges are grouped by region, roughly in line with the old county boundaries Freemasons wear masonic aprons, dating back to the theory that freemasonry evolved from the stonemasons, who wore them for protection from stone chipping The ""third degree"" is the final stage before becoming a fully fledged Mason. The ceremony involves close questioning, which is where the expression ""giving someone the third degree"" originates Famous Freemasons have included Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Burns, Oscar Wilde and Peter Sellers There are about 200,000 Freemasons in England and Wales, who meet in more than 7,000 lodges. In the last week, the Guardian reported thattwo Freemasons' lodges are operating at Westminster,external- which it said were for MPs and political journalists. But Dr Staples said that, although the lodges existed, none of their members were MPs or political journalists. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The UK's inflation rate has fallen for the first time since June, mainly because of the impact of air fares. The inflation rate dipped to 3% in December, down from November's rate of 3.1% - a six-year high. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat while air fares rose last month, it had a smaller impact than at the same point in 2016. It added that a drop in the price of toys and games also contributed to December's fall. The ONS said it was too early to say whether this was the start of a longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation. The Bank of England has said it thinks inflation peaked at the end of 2017 and will fall back to its target of 2% this year. The rate had been rising over the past year, partly due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote which has pushed up the cost of imported goods. In November, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The continued weakness of underlying price pressures means that the MPC has little need to rush the next rate hike."" Midlands sees biggest house price rises UK manufacturing output best for 10 years Aberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O'Carroll agreed there was no need for another quick rise in interest rates, but said: ""What matters most for the long-term health of the UK economy is improving its productivity performance. ""If we can do that then the Bank of England may be able to keep rates low for a lot longer. But on recent experience, improving productivity is much easier said than done."" What a difference a 10th of a percentage point makes. Inflation in the year to December was 3%, rather than the previous 3.1%, naturally generating predictions that it has now peaked. One of the biggest factors driving inflation has been the inflated price of imports following the Brexit vote feeding through to the shops. Yes, the vote and the devaluation of the pound following it was more than a year-and-a-half ago. But because many retailers buy their stock a year or two ahead, they have only felt the impact of costlier imports in the last few months. For the same reason the recent rally in sterling, which if it lasts should bring down the cost of imports, isn't yet benefiting consumers. In fact, taking goods prices separately from services, inflation at 3.4% is higher than it's been for more than five years. Even if inflation more broadly has peaked, the Bank of England has to bring it down over the next two to three years closer to its 2% target. On that basis trading in the City currently forecasts the next interest rate rise will take place in August. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the drop in inflation was not enough to ""significantly ease the pressure on UK household spending"" because wages were still rising by less than the rate of inflation. However, he said that if that situation changed then ""a sustained trend of falling inflation and better wage growth could spell happier times for the UK consumer, and the UK economy"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""We suspect that relatively lacklustre economic growth will continue to limit domestic price pressures. ""Earnings growth seems likely to pick up only gradually as some firms remain keen to limit their total costs in a challenging and uncertain environment. ""Fragile consumer confidence may also deter some workers from pushing hard for increased pay rises, despite recent higher inflation and a tight labour market."" The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, rose to 4.1% last month from 3.9% in November. The ONS's preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner-occupiers' housing costs, fell to 2.7% in December, down from 2.8% the month before.

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track. Bank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. However, they said rates would need to rise ""earlier"" and by a ""somewhat greater extent"" than they thought at their last review in November. Economists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May. The value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments. Higher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy. Live: Pound jumps as rates hold steady What would a rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Growth better, but warning lights flashing on rates Five key messages from the Bank of England Around 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. Interest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England. But for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. In November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%. Its forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years. But it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected. ""The Committee judges thatâ¦ monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,"" minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said. The Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth. It also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost. As a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. But it says its forecasts are based on a ""smooth"" adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Read Kamal's blog in full Economists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain. ""All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%."" Official figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting. Unemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%. The Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November. In the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was ""almost entirely"" due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.

"Many councils spent more than the planned to on providing services in 2016-17 One in three English councils spent more on services in a year than they expected to, according to official data. The total expenditure during 2016-17 for 113 councils came to just over Â£1.5bn more than was given in official estimates. Councils said that in many cases they received additional funding that meant their budgets still balanced, despite big cuts in central government grants. It comes asNorthamptonshire County Councilhas introduced emergency spending controls due to ""severe financial challenges"". Analysis ofofficial budget data,externalby the BBC England Data Unit found about one in three English local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to at the start of the financial year. From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, while resources are being stretched. The Local Government Association (LGA), the body that speaks for councils says over the next two years local authorities are facing a funding gap of Â£5.8bn. The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population. Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. In 2016-17 local authorities spent Â£1.1bn more on social care than was in their forecast budgets. Government data on ""net current expenditure"" represents what councils expect to spend on providing all services such as schools, care homes and housing, before they receive funding from central government to pay for them. The fact that one in three councils spent more than they expected to last year does not mean councils are in financial trouble. However, it does show many councils found demand on their services to be greater than they had anticipated. South Hams District Council in Devon spent Â£6.6m more than was estimated, equivalent to 21% more than was forecast. However, the authority stressed that once additional grant funding or income the council generated for itself was taken into account, it was left Â£45,000 over budget. Selby District Council in Yorkshire, which spent Â£4.6m more on services than expected, said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term too"". A spokesman said: ""Our accounts for 2016-17 and our arrangements for securing value for money have been given a clean bill of health by our external auditors."" Northamptonshire County Council overspent by Â£43m Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000. Northamptonshire County Council says it currently has Â£608m in outstanding loan debts and Â£194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities. The means the council's combined debts of Â£802m are greater than its planned budget spend of Â£706m. Northamptonshire County Council also had thelargest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers. The Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said the heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers. Northamptonshire County Council's finances 'serious' Council spend on agency social workers doubles Northamptonshire County Council 'warned it was unsustainable' The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review."" An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018. Correction 14 February 2018: This article has been amended to better reflect the issues raised by this data, which relate to forecast budget versus actual spending rather than overspending.

"Social workers in Nottinghamshire spoke about the challenges of having high numbers of agency staff Council spending on social workers from agencies has doubled in the past four years, figures show. UK spending increased from Â£180m in 2012-13 to Â£356m in 2016-17. Staff say relying on agencies to fill shortages in the permanent workforces can drain council funds and high turnover among these staff can lead to a poorer quality of service. The Department for Education said it had invested more than Â£750m to support the recruitment of social workers. Lesley Hagger, director of children's services at Northamptonshire County Council, said: ""Whilst we are using our resources to pay high costs for agency staff, we can't provide other services we might want to, such as early help services, to prevent children coming into care in the first place."" And while she valued agency staff and they were very good, they cost more than she could afford to pay. Councils struggled to recruit social workers, because they were being ""lambasted"", and this drove up agency costs, Ms Hagger said. ""They are the people that do one of the most important and difficult jobs in the country, and they don't get very much recognition for it,"" she said. Lesley Hagger says social workers do not receive enough recognition By Alison Holt, BBC social affairs correspondent The demands made on social workers are huge and increasing, whether they are protecting children or helping adults who are vulnerable because of their age or disabilities. They are professionals who in case conferences will sit alongside doctors and police officers as life-changing decisions are made. But many social workers will say rather than the respect those other professionals get, they face suspicion and blame if things go wrong. They have long complained about poor pay, high caseloads and the unrelenting pressure of the job. That's why working for an agency, where you get paid more and can leave when you wish, can seem like an attractive option. But for those who rely on their help, such as children, frequent changes in social worker are damaging. It makes it harder to trust the person there to help you, if you think they will leave soon. And it is easier for warning signs to be missed when cases are handed from person to person. The ongoing challenge for councils and government is not just how to recruit enough people to be social workers but how to make sure they will stay for the long term. And with so much money being spent on plugging the gaps, the cost of failing to do this is massive. The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to all councils in the UK with social care responsibilities asking for their spending on agency social workers. This covered staff working with both adults and children. Of the 211 councils, 153 responded in full, showing spending had risen Â£176m over the past four years. According to Department for Education figures, the number of agency social workers employed by local authorities in England's children's services rose from 3,250 to 5,330 between 2013 and 2016. The BBC was able to collect data for only the first 11 months of 2016-17. Our full-year figure assumes that spending in the final month of the year was not very different to the rest of the year. Some authorities provided information for their whole children's and adult services departments, with their figures including social work administrators as well as qualified social workers. Councils with largest agency social worker spending increases for adults and children's services from 2012-13 to 2016-17 Northamptonshire:  Â£17,392,364 Birmingham:            Â£12,248,660 Wandsworth:             Â£7,263,426 Rotherham:               Â£6,170,565 Kirklees:                     Â£6,118,715 In Northamptonshire, spending on agency staff in children's services in particular rose from Â£1.7m to Â£17.9m over the four-year period Sue Stevenson, team manager of the social work academy at Northamptonshire, said the resulting staff turnover made it very difficult to follow through with care plans for vulnerable children. ""Risk will get missed, potentially, and support not be put in place in a timely way, because maybe that referral has been made but then it might need chasing up,"" she said. In an attempt to retain more permanent staff, the academy gives newly trained social workers additional training and guidance, as well as less complex caseworks in their first year. Sue Stevenson says using agency staff can make handing over cases more difficult. Claire Kober, who chairs the Local Government Association's Resources Board, said: ""The government needs to support council schemes to recruit social workers, by improving the image and career prospects of social work. ""It needs to provide more funding and give councils freedom to use this money to the best effect according to local priorities."" Unison head of local government Heather Wakefield said: ""With morale so low, many social workers are choosing to move into agency work where they have more control over their hours and can get better pay. ""The government has made social work a profession in crisis."" The Department of Education said training programmes were bringing in high-calibre graduates and preparing them for the realities of both children's and adult social work. It said more than 1,300 adult social workers had qualified in 2016-17. ""Councils increased spending on children and young people's services to over Â£9bn in 2015-16, and we are empowering councils to develop new and better ways of delivering these services,"" a spokesman added.

"This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track. Bank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. However, they said rates would need to rise ""earlier"" and by a ""somewhat greater extent"" than they thought at their last review in November. Economists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May. The value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments. Higher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy. Live: Pound jumps as rates hold steady What would a rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Growth better, but warning lights flashing on rates Five key messages from the Bank of England Around 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. Interest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England. But for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. In November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%. Its forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years. But it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected. ""The Committee judges thatâ¦ monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,"" minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said. The Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth. It also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost. As a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. But it says its forecasts are based on a ""smooth"" adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Read Kamal's blog in full Economists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain. ""All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%."" Official figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting. Unemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%. The Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November. In the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was ""almost entirely"" due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.

"Children were encouraged to do an extra 30 minutes of exercise every day School programmes encouraging children to take more exercise and eat healthily are unlikely to have any real effect on childhood obesity, a study in the British Medical Journal suggests.

"Low rates of pay and workload pressures mean care services can no longer fill key posts in England, a watchdog says. TheNational Audit Office,externalsaid a lack of government planning and funding had undermined the ""Cinderella"" service and its 1.34 million staff. The sector was struggling in particular to recruit nurses and senior staff to run services, causing the elderly and disabled to go without care, it said. The warning comes as ministers draw up plans to overhaul the sector. The government has promised a Green Paper with proposals to change the way care services work will be published by the summer. This will cover care homes and support in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing paid for both by councils and privately by individuals. The NAO said changes were desperately needed, as there was no guarantee the extra Â£2bn being invested in the sector over the next three years would have any significant impact. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care Tammy Ardron works as a nurse in a nursing home in South Yorkshire. She says she is not surprised nurses turn their backs on the sector because it is an incredibly demanding job. She says she works 12-hour shifts and has to care for 30 different people at a time, many with complex conditions and challenging behaviour. ""It is busy. You've got to be on the ball all the time. ""When you are hospital based you have doctors at the end of the beep, somebody to call on. Here you are on your own."" The review warned low rates of pay - most of the 815,000 carers in the system were paid less than Â£7.50 an hour and a third were on zero-hour contracts - was making it difficult to attract staff. Across the sector, 6.6% of posts remained unfilled, with 28% of staff leaving their jobs each year - double the rate in the wider economy. But the most serious problems were being seen in key posts: One in 11 nursing posts was vacant, after the numbers working in the sector fell by 8,000 to 43,000 in the past four years One in nine register-manager jobs was unfilled, these are considered vital to ensure services comply with laws and regulations The NAO said it was clear councils were struggling to find the money to fund the services properly. And this had meant that people who paid their own fees - the system is means-tested - were effectively subsidising the state. NAO chief Amyas Morse said: ""Social care cannot continue as a Cinderella service - without a valued and rewarded workforce."" Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said councils were doing all they could to ""protect services"", but without extra funding in the forthcoming change of the system she feared providers of services would start pulling out of the sector. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the report was a ""damning indictment of the failure of successive governments"" and meant frail older people were going without the care they needed. The government said it would unveil its plans for the sector later in the year and also pointed out Health Education England was currently putting together a 10-year workforce strategy which would take a long-term look at the sustainability of the health and care sectors.

"MPs found to have bullied or harassed their staff will have to write a letter of apology and undergo training, under new proposals. In more serious cases, they could be suspended or forced to face a public vote on their future. The plans were drawn up by a cross-party committee after widespread allegations of sexual harassment. At the moment, MPs don't have any formal disciplinary procedures. Discipline is handled by their parties and there are no independent channels for staff to raise complaints about their behaviour. MPs' staff tell of bullying and abuse Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, who chaired the committee, said: ""This is a major step in bringing about the culture change that Parliament needs."" She acknowledged how difficult it was for MPs to be ejected from Parliament under the current rules, given how many had continued to sit after admitting, or being found guilty of, misconduct. ""It's for individual perpetrators to make a decision on whether to resign or retire,"" she told MPs. ""But it is absolutely the intention of this new procedure that they will and can be forced to do so, regardless of who they are and what their role is."" The committee also wants MPs to be given mandatory training in appropriate behaviour in the workplace, which would start after the next general election. ""Consent training"" and lessons in how to recruit staff and avoid ""unconscious bias"" will also be made available. This video can not be played Kate Maltby tells Today there needs to be ""political will"" to change attitudes towards harassment in Parliament Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who sat on the committee, rejected claims that training was unnecessary because MPs should already be aware of how to behave towards staff and colleagues. ""The MPs who are kicking up the most fuss about the training are precisely the ones who should be first in the queue for it,"" she told BBC News. She also defended plans to grant anonymity to both the accusers and alleged perpetrators, amid claims that keeping the identity of an offender secret could prevent other alleged victims from coming forward. The committee had wanted to ensure complainants were ""given the power in this process"", she said, but ""it doesn't take very much investigation"" to work out the identity of an accuser if the MP employing them is named. If the most serious sanctions were applied, the identity of the alleged perpetrator would be made public, under the committee's proposals. This video can not be played The complainant can ""seek justice without having their names splashed across the newspapers"" says Mrs Leadsom MPs are in a ""constant media spotlight"" and ""checks and balances"" were needed to guard against ""vexatious"" complaints, the report said. Under the new proposals, which will also apply to members of the House of Lords, a trained sexual violence adviser will be appointed to handle complaints. The adviser would lead an ""informal"" resolution process, which could result in a written apology for the complainant or workplace training for the perpetrator. Complainants would be given ""practical and emotional"" support, whether or not they decide to take the matter to the police or pursue their claim. In more serious cases, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner would investigate and recommend the suspension of an MP or peer for a specified period. This could trigger proceedings for recall of an MP - resulting in a new election in his or her constituency - or the expulsion of a peer, under procedures introduced in 2014 by the coalition government. The committee also called for a new code of behaviour, independent of the political parties, applying to everyone on the Parliamentary estate, including visitors. In a survey carried out by the MPs' working group more than 250 people said they had seen or experienced sexual harassment in the past year. The survey, which got 1,377 responses, or 17% of the Westminster workforce, found that as well as 19% reporting experience of sexual harassment, 39% had experienced non-sexual harassment or bullying in the past 12 months. It was ""unacceptable"" that such ""inappropriate behaviours"" have taken place across the ""parliamentary community"", the report added. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said she hoped the report would create a ""safe and secure and constructive workplace"" for everyone working at Westminster. The SNP's Pete Wishart, who also helped draw up the recommendations, said he hoped they would ""signal the end of the poisonous patriarchal culture that has characterised so many of the relationships in this House"". The proposals will be debated by MPs later this month.

The warning comes as figures for the NHS in England showed January was one of the most difficult months on record. Record numbers of seriously-ill patients faced delays waiting for a bed - with 1,000 waiting over 12 hours. It comes despite the mass cancellation of routine treatments to ease pressure.

Similar performance is being recorded in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland are doing even worse. A&E stats don't tell full story of a difficult winter Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes However, it was the issue of finding beds that has sparked most alarm. These are known as trolley waits, because patients often find themselves on trolleys in side-rooms and corridors until a bed comes free on a ward. These tend to be the most seriously-ill patients, so doctors decide to admit them on to a ward rather than treat them in A&E. Some 81,000 waited more than four hours for a bed in England - one in five of the 390,000 people who needed to be admitted. Both the four-hour and 12-hour figures for trolley waits were the worst on record - figures go back to 2010. But this does come amid rising numbers of A&E attendances. The data from NHS England shows more than two million patients came to A&E during the month, a rise of more than 5% in a year. Health bosses said with that in mind - and the high levels of flu that have been seen in the worst outbreak since 2011 - the NHS has performed well. Ian Dalton, chief executive at the regulator NHS Improvement, said it was a ""testament"" to the dedication of staff that performance had not declined further.

"A campaign group fighting to keep the UK in the EU has received Â£400,000 from billionaire investor George Soros. Mr Soros made his donation to Best for Britain through one of his foundations. TheDaily Telegraph says the group will launch advertising,externallater this month to rally public opinion and convince MPs to vote against the final Brexit deal. Best for Britain chairman Lord Malloch-Brown, a former Labour minister, said Mr Soros was a ""valued"" supporter but small donors had contributed more. Mr Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, made a fortune in 1992 betting against sterling on Black Wednesday, forcing then-PM John Major to take the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The activists still fighting Brexit What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? Brexit: All you need to know May and ministers hammer out Brexit stance He has previously suggested it was possible that the UK would apply to rejoin the European Union soon after Brexit. According to the Telegraph, the donation was made through Mr Soros's Open Society Foundation Best for Britain was co-founded by Gina Miller, who took the UK government to court in 2016 over its triggering of the Article 50 process to leave the EU. A judge ruled Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit. Mrs Miller left Best for Britain last June. Lord Malloch-Brown confirmed Mr Soros's contribution but said some of the campaign's other major donors had given more. He added Best for Britain had followed rules governing financial contributions. He said: ""We have never hidden our agenda; we have been campaigning hard to win a meaningful vote on Brexit, which we did, and to keep all options on the table, including staying in the European Union."" He said the campaign was a ""democratic and patriotic effort to recover our future and we welcome support for our efforts from many quarters"". The involvement of Mr Soros was reported in the Daily Telegraph in a story co-written by Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy. In an article in the paper, Mr Timothy maintained the objective of the campaign was ""to convince MPs to vote against the deal Theresa May negotiates with Brussels, regardless of its content"". He said: ""Malloch-Brown and his backers believe that, if Parliament rejects the Brexit deal, the government will fall, and Brexit can then be stopped.""

"XXIII Olympic Winter Games Venue:Pyeongchang, South KoreaDates:9-25 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button, Connected TVs, BBC Sport website and mobile app. Warped skis, fake snow and predicted windchill temperatures of -25C... is Pyeongchang going to be too cold for even a Winter Olympics? As the name of the event suggests, it is supposed to be cold - but the 2018 edition, which starts on Friday, looks set to break all records. Concerned athletes are already shivering on social media, so what will seriously sub-zero temperatures mean for events, for the equipment, and for the competitors and fans getting ready for 17 days of action? Winter Olympics - Day-by-day guide to Pyeongchang 2018 Between-2Cand-5Cfor the opening ceremony - starting at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT) - according to the Korean Meteorological Administration's news conference on Wednesday. The agency says this is ""on par"" with average February temperatures in previous years of around0Cwith temperatures at night getting down to around -10C.To date, the 1994 edition in Lillehammer, Norway, was the coldest Games on record with a low of-11C. At nearly half a mile above sea level, Pyeongchang is regarded as one of the coldest regions of South Korea, and is Earth's coldest location for its latitude. But then on Wednesday parts of the UK woke up to temperatures as low as-9C- so what's all the fuss about? It's the windchill factor. At the opening ceremony rehearsal on Saturday, biting winds dropped the temperature to-23C.The agency said spectators should ""brace themselves"" and Olympics officials have warned everyone attending to ""wrap up and prepare properly"". Situated in the Taebaek Mountains, around 50 miles from the border with North Korea, the area is also susceptible to winds that travel down from Siberia and the Manchurian Plain in north-east China, meaning it will feel much colder than the base temperatures imply Because of the freezing temperatures, Pyeongchang is susceptible to variable levels of snowfall. Major snowstorms are a rarity in the area, and in February 2017it snowed on just seven days,externalwith an average snowfall of 6.3cm. It's a concern shared by Games organisers who, as a result, have brought in snow cannons - which force cooled water and pressurised air through a 'snow gun' - to produce it artificially at a cost of Â£4.4m. At the Yongpyong Alpine Centre - which will host slalom and giant slalom alpine skiing races - 250 snow guns served by three pumping stations have been installed. ""The wind is the worst - you walk around the Olympic village and it is like a nightmare,"" says Canadian skeleton racer Kevin Boyer, ""It's funny because coming from Canada we talk about being used to the cold but this is a cold we haven't seen before."" The first real test will be Friday's opening ceremony, with reports that some athletes may miss it altogether. The Italian team has already told any staff with existing health issues to skip the curtain-raiser and has reminded its athletes to keep moving at all times. The US team havespecially heated jackets,externalfor the opening ceremony, while Australian freestyle skier Lydia Lassila has turned down the opportunity to carry her nation's flag into the opening ceremony to avoid the cold before competition. Team GB have, after a ""significant"" amount of planning, designed a kit geared around both ""performance and warmth"". Winter Olympics 2018: Great Britain's team for Pyeongchang In terms of the events, cross country skiing rules say that at -20C racing will be postponed - but that's base temperature not including windchill factor. Many previous Olympic events have been postponed because of wind, too much snow, or fog but never purely because it's too cold. Team GB cross country skier Andrew Musgrave will make his third Olympic appearance in Pyeongchang ""One of the coaches said they are throwing the skis out after today,"" said ski course technician Craig Randell, overseeing practice on Wednesday. ""You can't do anything about it, but with the cold temperatures the snow adheres to the ski base and twists it. ""They are turning their skis to garbage real fast."" Austrian alpine skier Marcel Hirscher added: ""Snow crystals get really sharp when temperatures go to -20C. It's the same as lighting a fire and burning your ski base because the snow crystals get such sharp edges."" Such icy surfaces can make competing difficult, with skiers and snowboarders struggling to dig their edges in to make turns. That said, if the ice is smooth it makes for the ultimate piste condition for the speed skiing events of downhill and super-G. On the bobsleigh and skeleton track, if temperatures are too low it can make the ice sticky, ultimately slowing the sleds down. But there's good news if you're a Dave Ryding fan. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, four-time winter Olympian Chemmy Alcott said: ""Artificial snow is very grippy and you feel great on it. ""It suits Dave Ryding, who is one of our best hopes."" The Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium - where the opening and closing ceremonies will take place - was built without a roof in order to save time, but it's a decision that organisers could come to regret given the current temperature forecast. Costing $58m (Â£44.1m) to build, the stadium also lacks central heating as it was deemed too expensive for the arena, which will be dismantled after the conclusion of March's Winter Paralympic Games. According to reports, six people who attended a concert at the pentagonal stadium in December weretreated for hypothermia,external, while others huddled in bathrooms to take a break from the icy cold. As a result, each of the 43,000 spectators expected to attend the opening ceremony on Friday will receive heating pads, a blanket, a warm seat cushion and a raincoat, while 18 heat shelters, 40 large heaters and windshields have been put up. Organisers are also planning audience participation during pre-ceremony entertainment in order to keep spectators as warm as possible. The stadium will be dismantled after the conclusion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games The last edition of the Winter Olympics - in the sub-tropical Russian city of Sochi in 2014 - was deemed the warmest ever as temperatures hit a high of 20C, hotter than some days of theLondon 2012 Summer Olympics,external. Organisers were forced to store snow in order to have enough for the duration of the Games - much of it man-made. The average temperature was just shy of 10C, beating the previous record set four years earlier at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. Vancouver had never seen a warmer stretch of winter weather than the 31-day period that finished on 9 February, just three days before the opening ceremony. As with their successors in 2014, organisers in Canada were forced to bring in snow by thetruckload,external, with only the slopes of Whistler - situated 120km north of Vancouver - having enough of the natural stuff to host the alpine and nordic skiing events. Cross country skiers pass a section of melted snow during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics BBC weatherman Simon King After the relatively warm Winter Olympics of Sochi and Vancouver, where there were issues with snow cover, this Olympic Games will be much colder. There will be variations and some extremes in temperature from the colder Pyeongchang mountain cluster (especially higher up in the Phoenix Snow Park and Jeongseon Alpine Centre where the air temperature is likely to be much lower), to the less cold coastal cluster of Gangneung where some events are taking place. February is typically one of the driest months of the year in Pyeongchang but on average it still gets around 5cm of fresh snow with it snowing on around 12 days of the month. That's the average.  As for the conditions over the next couple of weeks, it's very likely to be colder than average with temperatures staying below freezing for most of the time. With the wind it'll feel bitterly cold and in the colder venues probably feel more like -25C to -30C.  It is also looking drier than average during the Games so while there will be some snow at times, on the whole it'll be dry.

"People wave a unified Korea flag during a joint Korean women's hockey match It is not unusual for the Olympic Games to take place with a heated political backdrop. But these Winter Olympics, in the mountainous Pyeongchang region of South Korea, are happening in particularly intriguing circumstances. We've condensed the story down to 100 words and 500 words - you can read each individually or one after the other. The Games are happening only 80km (50 miles) from the North Korean border and come at a time of heightened concerns over the North's military capabilities. After several missile and nuclear tests, there are fears North Korea, an autocratic, unpredictable state, may now have a nuclear weapon they're able to fit on a missile - one that could reach the US. Leader Kim Jong-un has also been engaged in a war of words with Donald Trump - a key ally to South Korea. But there's been a warming of ties between North and South before the Games. How long will that last? The Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are taking place in a country still technically at war with its neighbour, which is only 80km (50 miles) from the Games venue. In reality though, they're not in a state of war - neither side was able to claim victory after the 1950-53 Korean War, so they agreed a ceasefire. Relations between the two remain fraught. But South Korea's president Moon Jae-in has said the Games are a ""precious opportunity"" to seek peace on the Korean peninsula, and has called these Games the ""Peace Olympics"". North Korean ice hockey player Choe Un-gyong cuts her birthday cake as North and South Korean teammates look on Both countries will walk together under the same unified flag, and are fielding a joint women's hockey team. The Korean peninsula has been divided since the end of World War Two. The North is an autocratic state of 25m people, largely isolated from the world, headed by Kim Jong-un. The South is a thriving democratic state of about 51m people that is a key US ally. Officially, both countries support unification. But their visions of what a unified Korea would look like are very different. North Korea, insisting it has the right to defend itself, has pushed ahead in recent years with developing a nuclear programme and producing ever more advanced missiles. In 2017, it conducted its sixth nuclear test and also tested intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US. North Korea also said it could now place a miniaturised nuclear weapon on top of a missile. North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy The US has installed a missile defence system in South Korea - its presence there has infuriated the North. Last year also saw a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump, who threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea in a UN speech. In a surprise move, Kim Jong-un extended a rare olive branch to the South in his new year's speech, saying he was willing to send a team to the Games. This was noteworthy as there hasn't been much co-operation between the countries under the past two governments in South Korea. The North also boycotted the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, so its willingness to travel to Pyeongchang is significant. After Mr Kim's speech, the North agreed to send a 500-strong delegation to the Games -his sister, Kim Yo-jong, was among the officials to visit. The warmer ties have been welcomed, but there's been plenty of scepticism too. Hong Joon-pyo, leader of South Korea's main opposition party, said the government ""is being dragged around by Kim Jong-un's false peace offensive and political show"". Inside the world's most secretive country Japan's foreign minister said North Korea was using the Games as a chance to improve its image, while continuing its missile and nuclear programmes regardless. ""It's not the time to ease pressure towards North Korea,"" Taro Kono said. Meanwhile, the signs that North Korea is happy to continue provoking its critics are still there - it moved its traditional military display forward two months, to the eve of the Games.

"The blaze is also causing travel disruption About 100 firefighters have spent the night tackling a blaze at an industrial unit in Greater Manchester. Crews were called to Albert Royds Street in Rochdale at about 01:20 GMT, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said. A number of homes have been evacuated and several schools have been closed because of the smoke. The blaze is under control but crews are expected to be on site for the rest of the day. At its height between 03:00 and 07:00, firefighters were using more than 10,000 litres of water every minute to douse the flames. United Utilities said some local residents suffered ""poor pressure"" or ""discoloured"" water as a result. There were 12 pumps and three aerial appliances still at the fire by mid-morning The fire is causing disruption to trains, with National Rail warning of bus replacements and a limited service between Rochdale and Todmorden. By 15:00, the effort had been scaled back to four fire crews and two aerial units after 14 hours. Area manager Ben Levy, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""Crews have worked tirelessly to bring the fire under control. Fire crews will remain at the site for most of the day About 100 firefighters spent the night tackling the blaze ""They worked quickly and efficiently to protect neighbouring properties because when we arrived there was a very real and immediate risk that the fire could spread to nearby houses. ""Thankfully, the actions of our firefighters meant that was not the case."" The public are still advised to keep doors and windows closed if there is any visible smoke and to avoid the area as the road remains closed.

"Low rates of pay and workload pressures mean care services can no longer fill key posts in England, a watchdog says. TheNational Audit Office,externalsaid a lack of government planning and funding had undermined the ""Cinderella"" service and its 1.34 million staff. The sector was struggling in particular to recruit nurses and senior staff to run services, causing the elderly and disabled to go without care, it said. The warning comes as ministers draw up plans to overhaul the sector. The government has promised a Green Paper with proposals to change the way care services work will be published by the summer. This will cover care homes and support in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing paid for both by councils and privately by individuals. The NAO said changes were desperately needed, as there was no guarantee the extra Â£2bn being invested in the sector over the next three years would have any significant impact. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care Tammy Ardron works as a nurse in a nursing home in South Yorkshire. She says she is not surprised nurses turn their backs on the sector because it is an incredibly demanding job. She says she works 12-hour shifts and has to care for 30 different people at a time, many with complex conditions and challenging behaviour. ""It is busy. You've got to be on the ball all the time. ""When you are hospital based you have doctors at the end of the beep, somebody to call on. Here you are on your own."" The review warned low rates of pay - most of the 815,000 carers in the system were paid less than Â£7.50 an hour and a third were on zero-hour contracts - was making it difficult to attract staff. Across the sector, 6.6% of posts remained unfilled, with 28% of staff leaving their jobs each year - double the rate in the wider economy. But the most serious problems were being seen in key posts: One in 11 nursing posts was vacant, after the numbers working in the sector fell by 8,000 to 43,000 in the past four years One in nine register-manager jobs was unfilled, these are considered vital to ensure services comply with laws and regulations The NAO said it was clear councils were struggling to find the money to fund the services properly. And this had meant that people who paid their own fees - the system is means-tested - were effectively subsidising the state. NAO chief Amyas Morse said: ""Social care cannot continue as a Cinderella service - without a valued and rewarded workforce."" Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said councils were doing all they could to ""protect services"", but without extra funding in the forthcoming change of the system she feared providers of services would start pulling out of the sector. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the report was a ""damning indictment of the failure of successive governments"" and meant frail older people were going without the care they needed. The government said it would unveil its plans for the sector later in the year and also pointed out Health Education England was currently putting together a 10-year workforce strategy which would take a long-term look at the sustainability of the health and care sectors.

"A ban on puppy sales by pet shops and other third-party dealers in England is being considered by the government. Under the proposals, people buying or adopting a dog would deal directly with a breeder or rehousing centre. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the plan would be examined as part of a new package of measures aimed at driving up welfare standards. Enhanced licensing conditions for breeders are already due to come into force this year. Under the new rules, breeders or sellers of dogs must be licensed and will not be able to sell puppies and kittens under eight weeks old. Puppies must also be shown alongside their mother before a sale is made, and - amid concern over online sales - purchases must be completed in the presence of the new owner. Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested a ban on third-party sales could lead to the creation of an illegal market. But the Dogs Trust welcomed the government's latest thinking on the issue, which is subject to aconsultation.,external Paula Boyden, veterinary director for the Dogs Trust, said: ""If a ban was introduced now, puppy farmers could exploit loopholes such as setting themselves up as unregulated re-homing centres or sanctuaries. ""Licensing and inspection of dog breeders and sellers must also be stronger to ensure that everyone involved in the trade is on the radar of local authorities."" RSPCA deputy chief executive Chris Wainwright said: ""We have always said that an end to third party sales alone would not be enough to end the puppy trade crisis, and we are pleased that this is being looked at alongside enhanced licensing conditions for breeders."" The RSPCA said many breeders are putting profit ahead of the health and welfare of dogs The charity's chief inspector Ian Briggs said officers had found dogs and puppies ""covered in filth"" while kept in cold, damp pens with no light by breeders and dealers involved in the underground puppy trade. He said: ""We've also found tiny puppies kept in buckets amongst the dead bodies of their siblings."" The Mayhew Animal Home charity highlighted the case of Luna, a Jack Russell terrier who was sold online despite being ill with a suspected skin disease. At six weeks old, Luna was already under the legal age required for puppies to be sold - but the seller claimed the young dog was 10 weeks old. Jack Russell terrier Luna was illegally sold underage online A Mayhew spokeswoman said the new rules, due to come into force at the end of October, will ban third-party sales like in Luna's case. And Mayhew's chief executive Caroline Yates said: ""Getting a dog or cat is not a commercial business and the big puppy farms have no regard for the health or welfare of animals. ""Owners are being duped into buying animals from these places."" In another case, the Dogs Trust said a French bulldog called Lola was forced to travel from eastern Europe so her puppies could be born and sold in the UK at a higher price. Two of her puppies later died. ""The law is not protecting these dogs and we need to be absolutely sure that future legislation is properly resourced and enforceable,"" the charity said.

"Rob Porter, pictured holding the document for President Trump, was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives One of US President Donald Trump's top aides has resigned amid abuse claims from his two ex-wives. White House staff secretary Rob Porter said ""these outrageous allegations are simply false"" as he announced he would step down. The accusations werefirst reported in the Daily Mail,externaland include accounts of physical and emotional abuse. The White House would not comment on a report that Mr Porter, 40, failed to receive security clearance. Colbie Holderness alleged Mr Porter punched her in the face on holiday in Florence, Italy His ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, both recounted stories of Mr Porter's alleged misconduct. His first spouse, Ms Holderness, said the White House aide had been verbally and physically abusive. Ms Holderness, a US government analyst, said Mr Porter had kicked her on their 2003 honeymoon in the Canary Islands. She also alleged he punched her in the face while they were on holiday a couple of years later in Florence, Italy. Jennifer Willoughby told the Daily Mail she filed a protective order against Mr Porter Ms Holderness supplied a photo of herself with a black eye to the media. Ms Willoughby, a motivational speaker, told the Daily Mail she was married to Mr Porter from 2009-13. She wrote about her experiences ina blog post entitled Why I Stayed,external. AnalysisbyTara McKelvey,BBCWhite House reporter Rob Porter was a squeaky-clean aide who made sure that papers landing on the president's desk were in order. The White House staff secretary also helped the president follow protocol. At one event in the East Room, for example, Mr Porter stood in the back of the room and gestured to the president, showing him where he was supposed to go in order to sign documents. Mr Porter's decision to resign - and the allegations against him - have shocked those who know him. She said she filed a protective order against him in June 2010 after he allegedly punched the glass of the door at their Alexandria, Virginia, home. Ms Willoughbytold the Washington Post on Wednesday,external: ""He has never faced repercussions that forced him to confront his issues. ""I care about him and want what's best for him, but that doesn't necessarily mean him keeping his job because he needs to face these underlying issues."" Mr Porter rejected the allegations in a statement read by the White House press secretary on Wednesday. Mr Porter (R) with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner (L) and chief of staff John Kelly (C) ""I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described,"" he said. ""I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a co-ordinated smear campaign."" The Daily Mail reported that Mr Porter did not receive security clearance for his White House job after the FBI interviewed his ex-wives during background checks. Mr Porter has been romantically linked with White House communications director Hope Hicks But the White House press secretary refused to be drawn on that issue. ""Background checks involve a complex investigation run by intelligence and law enforcement agencies,"" Mrs Sanders told reporters. ""As has always been our policy, we do not comment on security clearances. Rob Porter has been effective in his role as Staff Secretary. ""The President and Chief of Staff have full confidence in his abilities and his performance."" Mr Porter attended Harvard with the President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. He formerly worked for Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who said he was ""heartbroken"" by the allegations. Mr Porter (L), White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn (2nd L) and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ""My staff loved him and he was a trusted advisor,"" Senator Hatch said in a statement. ""I do not know the details of Rob's personal life. ""Domestic violence in any form is abhorrent. I am praying for Rob and those involved."" Mr Porter's White House role involved working with the president and his chief of staff John Kelly. Before Mr Porter resigned, Mr Kelly told the Daily Mail the staff secretary was ""a man of true integrity and honour"". According to the reports, Mr Porter has recently been romantically linked with White House communications director Hope Hicks.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju were hailed at the parade North Korea has held a military parade attended by leader Kim Jong-un, a day before the opening of the Winter Olympics in the South. The North often boasts of its parades but reports of this surfaced afterwards with TV only airing delayed footage. This event is usually held in April and moving it had been seen as a setback to the warming of ties over the Olympics. But the South announced on Thursday its president would meet the North's Olympics delegation on Saturday. Moon Jae-in will have lunch with the 22-strong team, which will include the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, and Kim Yo-jong, the influential sister of Kim Jong-un who will become the first member of the ruling dynasty to visit the South. Both were at the parade. Early on Thursday state TV began showing patriotic films in what appeared to be a prelude to a live broadcast. But delayed and unscheduled footage of the event only appeared on TV in the North at 17:00 local time (08:30 GMT). The parade this year marks the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army The parade was reportedly smaller than recent years and the footage showed Kim Jong-un inspecting troops, alongside his wife Ri Sol-ju. There was the traditional goose-steeping and a show of heavy weapons. Mr Kim said the North had become a ""world-class military power"". The annual parade, which this year marks the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army, is normally held in April and this was the first time in 40 years it had been given a February date. Such parades are often given a much higher profile. In 2017, North Korea aired a live broadcast of its military parade on state television. Foreign journalists were invited to cover the event. South Korean government officials said last month that some 13,000 troops and 200 pieces of equipment had been spotted near an airport in Pyongyang in what appeared to be a rehearsal for the parade. Analysis: Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring While much of the parade was standard fare, it was the event's climax with the appearance of North Korea's missile force that drew the greatest attention. The stars of the show were four Hwasong-15 ballistic missiles on their nine-axled TEL vehicles (Transport Elevator Launcher). The Hwasong-15 made its maiden flight in November last year and has a claimed range of more than 13,000km (8,000 miles), which would theoretically put Washington DC in range. It's the first time that multiple examples of the type have been seen together. Also on display were several Hwasong-14 missiles (designated KN-20 by the US) on extended truck mounts, as well as Hwasong-12 (KN-17) and Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) intermediate range missiles. Most notable by their absence were any additional TEL vehicles, possibly meaning the North is still struggling to overcome a shortage. Some observers also saw possible clones or copies of Russian 9K720 Iskander short-range ballistic missiles. The North had insisted on the event, despite criticism from the US and others about its timing - a day before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February in the mountain town of Pyeongchang. It had appeared to be a setback to the rapprochement with the South over the Games, which has generally seen a political charm offensive by the North. But commentators in the South said avoiding live TV coverage may have been an attempt to keep the parade low key. The parade is not the only challenge the apparent warming of ties has faced. There has been criticism in the South about a joint women's ice hockey team, andthe North cancelled a pre-Olympics cultural event, citing media bias in the South. How the attendance of the North's delegation fits in with international sanctions and blacklists has also been a problem. South Korea has had to ask the UN for an exemption to allow Choe Hwi, a UN sanctioned North Korean official, to attend. Koreas Olympics: The politics in brief N Korea leader's sister takes 'real power' south North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The Games will see both Koreas march under one flag at Friday's opening ceremony. The South said President Moon would meet the North's team on Saturday, although no location was given. Kim Yo-jong is seen in a 2015 picture with her brother, touring a military unit The top officials from the North will arrive by plane on Friday. Most of its 280-strong delegation, including 229 cheerleaders, four officials from the National Olympic Committee, 26 taekwondo demonstrators and 21 journalists. arrived via a border crossing on Wednesday. On Thursday, North Korea said it had no intention of meeting US officials during the event. 'Peace Olympics' politics explained Vice-President Mike Pence arrived in South Korea on Thursday and met President Moon later in the day. Mr Moon said the ""most important thing is close co-operation between South Korea and the United States"" and that the US's ""firm stance"" had created the opportunity for North-South dialogue. The US has been sceptical of the North's actions. Mr Pence said earlier he wanted to ""make sure North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the [Games] to paper over the truth about their regime"". This video can not be played Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono: ""N Korea charm offensive shows sanctions work"" He also said the US would soon unveil ""the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever"". Although he did not close the door to talks, saying there was the ""possibility for any kind of an encounter"", he said he would tell the North it would need to ""once and for all abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile ambition"". It has now been confirmed Kim Jong-un's sister will attend Friday's opening ceremony. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says this could provide a diplomatic headache, as Mr Pence will be there with the father of Otto Warmbier, who died after being imprisoned in North Korea.

"MPs found to have bullied or harassed their staff will have to write a letter of apology and undergo training, under new proposals. In more serious cases, they could be suspended or forced to face a public vote on their future. The plans were drawn up by a cross-party committee after widespread allegations of sexual harassment. At the moment, MPs don't have any formal disciplinary procedures. Discipline is handled by their parties and there are no independent channels for staff to raise complaints about their behaviour. MPs' staff tell of bullying and abuse Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, who chaired the committee, said: ""This is a major step in bringing about the culture change that Parliament needs."" She acknowledged how difficult it was for MPs to be ejected from Parliament under the current rules, given how many had continued to sit after admitting, or being found guilty of, misconduct. ""It's for individual perpetrators to make a decision on whether to resign or retire,"" she told MPs. ""But it is absolutely the intention of this new procedure that they will and can be forced to do so, regardless of who they are and what their role is."" The committee also wants MPs to be given mandatory training in appropriate behaviour in the workplace, which would start after the next general election. ""Consent training"" and lessons in how to recruit staff and avoid ""unconscious bias"" will also be made available. This video can not be played Kate Maltby tells Today there needs to be ""political will"" to change attitudes towards harassment in Parliament Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who sat on the committee, rejected claims that training was unnecessary because MPs should already be aware of how to behave towards staff and colleagues. ""The MPs who are kicking up the most fuss about the training are precisely the ones who should be first in the queue for it,"" she told BBC News. She also defended plans to grant anonymity to both the accusers and alleged perpetrators, amid claims that keeping the identity of an offender secret could prevent other alleged victims from coming forward. The committee had wanted to ensure complainants were ""given the power in this process"", she said, but ""it doesn't take very much investigation"" to work out the identity of an accuser if the MP employing them is named. If the most serious sanctions were applied, the identity of the alleged perpetrator would be made public, under the committee's proposals. This video can not be played The complainant can ""seek justice without having their names splashed across the newspapers"" says Mrs Leadsom MPs are in a ""constant media spotlight"" and ""checks and balances"" were needed to guard against ""vexatious"" complaints, the report said. Under the new proposals, which will also apply to members of the House of Lords, a trained sexual violence adviser will be appointed to handle complaints. The adviser would lead an ""informal"" resolution process, which could result in a written apology for the complainant or workplace training for the perpetrator. Complainants would be given ""practical and emotional"" support, whether or not they decide to take the matter to the police or pursue their claim. In more serious cases, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner would investigate and recommend the suspension of an MP or peer for a specified period. This could trigger proceedings for recall of an MP - resulting in a new election in his or her constituency - or the expulsion of a peer, under procedures introduced in 2014 by the coalition government. The committee also called for a new code of behaviour, independent of the political parties, applying to everyone on the Parliamentary estate, including visitors. In a survey carried out by the MPs' working group more than 250 people said they had seen or experienced sexual harassment in the past year. The survey, which got 1,377 responses, or 17% of the Westminster workforce, found that as well as 19% reporting experience of sexual harassment, 39% had experienced non-sexual harassment or bullying in the past 12 months. It was ""unacceptable"" that such ""inappropriate behaviours"" have taken place across the ""parliamentary community"", the report added. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said she hoped the report would create a ""safe and secure and constructive workplace"" for everyone working at Westminster. The SNP's Pete Wishart, who also helped draw up the recommendations, said he hoped they would ""signal the end of the poisonous patriarchal culture that has characterised so many of the relationships in this House"". The proposals will be debated by MPs later this month.

"A ban on puppy sales by pet shops and other third-party dealers in England is being considered by the government. Under the proposals, people buying or adopting a dog would deal directly with a breeder or rehousing centre. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the plan would be examined as part of a new package of measures aimed at driving up welfare standards. Enhanced licensing conditions for breeders are already due to come into force this year. Under the new rules, breeders or sellers of dogs must be licensed and will not be able to sell puppies and kittens under eight weeks old. Puppies must also be shown alongside their mother before a sale is made, and - amid concern over online sales - purchases must be completed in the presence of the new owner. Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested a ban on third-party sales could lead to the creation of an illegal market. But the Dogs Trust welcomed the government's latest thinking on the issue, which is subject to aconsultation.,external Paula Boyden, veterinary director for the Dogs Trust, said: ""If a ban was introduced now, puppy farmers could exploit loopholes such as setting themselves up as unregulated re-homing centres or sanctuaries. ""Licensing and inspection of dog breeders and sellers must also be stronger to ensure that everyone involved in the trade is on the radar of local authorities."" RSPCA deputy chief executive Chris Wainwright said: ""We have always said that an end to third party sales alone would not be enough to end the puppy trade crisis, and we are pleased that this is being looked at alongside enhanced licensing conditions for breeders."" The RSPCA said many breeders are putting profit ahead of the health and welfare of dogs The charity's chief inspector Ian Briggs said officers had found dogs and puppies ""covered in filth"" while kept in cold, damp pens with no light by breeders and dealers involved in the underground puppy trade. He said: ""We've also found tiny puppies kept in buckets amongst the dead bodies of their siblings."" The Mayhew Animal Home charity highlighted the case of Luna, a Jack Russell terrier who was sold online despite being ill with a suspected skin disease. At six weeks old, Luna was already under the legal age required for puppies to be sold - but the seller claimed the young dog was 10 weeks old. Jack Russell terrier Luna was illegally sold underage online A Mayhew spokeswoman said the new rules, due to come into force at the end of October, will ban third-party sales like in Luna's case. And Mayhew's chief executive Caroline Yates said: ""Getting a dog or cat is not a commercial business and the big puppy farms have no regard for the health or welfare of animals. ""Owners are being duped into buying animals from these places."" In another case, the Dogs Trust said a French bulldog called Lola was forced to travel from eastern Europe so her puppies could be born and sold in the UK at a higher price. Two of her puppies later died. ""The law is not protecting these dogs and we need to be absolutely sure that future legislation is properly resourced and enforceable,"" the charity said.

" Falmata is getting a full beauty treatment - a thick paste of henna, with its delicate pointed swirls, adorns her feet. While it dries, a woman is battling with her hair. Comb in hand she’s stretching and straightening Falmata’s tight curls. “We were allowed to choose any style for the hair and the henna,” remembers Falmata. “We got the henna to dye our hands, legs and sometimes even the neck.” Falmata knows she is going to look beautiful. But there’s a deadly consequence. Once she's been made up, a suicide bomb will be attached to her waist. Falmata is one of hundreds of young women, most of them teenagers, who have been abducted by militants in Nigeria and forced to carry out missions for them. Remarkably, she survived. She was just 13 when she was snatched by two men on a motorbike while she was walking to a relative’s house near the border with Cameroon. They rode for hours - Falmata pinned between the two men - leaving the road and travelling deep into a forest. Eventually they reached their destination - a huge, makeshift camp. Falmata had no idea where she was. “There were many tents and thatched houses,” she says, almost whispering. “The young girls were put in the tents. There were nine in mine and we had to sleep on big mats.” The camp belonged to Boko Haram, the militant group that has been fighting a long insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic state in northern Nigeria. “At first I wanted to escape but there was no chance,” she says. Men were stationed all around the camp to catch anyone who tried to leave. It wasn’t long before Falmata was forced to make a choice - marry a fighter, or go on a “mission”. She refused to get married. “I told them that I was still too young,” she says. But she had no idea what the “mission” was. At first Falmata found the camp frightening. Conditions were rough, and the captives - women, girls and boys - feared being caught up in the war between government forces and the militant group. Particularly the women. “We were scared that soldiers would storm the camp at any time and not spare us, the women, because they would think we were the fighters’ wives,” says Falmata. If a helicopter or plane appeared in the sky, the captives would panic, certain that the camp was about to be bombed by the Nigerian forces. “When we saw them many of us cried,” she says. “Some would even soil themselves.” Life in the camp was incredibly monotonous. Wake up, pray, eat, clean, pray, eat, and clean - all day long. There were daily religious lessons, long hours reciting verses from the Koran. Falmata says that while she hated everything in the camp, she welcomed the religious teaching. One day, the monotony of her daily routine was interrupted. Falmata was approached by armed men and instructed to prepare herself for something important. Her feet were to be decorated with henna. Her hair was to be straightened. Was she being prepared for her wedding, she wondered. Was she going to be married off to a fighter after all? “My friend Hauwa had agreed to get married as a way of trying to stay alive,” Falmata says. “She wanted to find a way to escape. “Other girls hated her for getting married and so did I at first. But then I understood her and felt sorry for her because she was unhappy.” The women helped Falmata get ready for whatever was in store for her. “All I was thinking was, ‘Is it for marriage or what?’ But you can’t ask why you’re getting this done. Instead friends just console you and tell you to be patient.” Two days later, she was approached by fighters. A bomb was forced around her waist. Falmata was told that if she killed non-believers, she would go straight to paradise. Like other women, her target would be a market or another crowded place. “I was so scared that I started crying. But they kept telling me to be patient, to accept that this is what life is about,” she says. “[They said] that on reaching paradise, everything would be better.” Two other girls from the camp had also been strapped to explosives, and the three of them were taken to the outskirts of a village. They were ordered to start walking towards the busy areas - someone would be watching them from a distance, they were told. In their hands were small, homemade detonators. On the way, the three of them discussed whether to carry out the “mission” or abandon it. Should they just do as they were ordered, or try to make their escape? They decided not to carry out the attack. After asking a stranger to help her remove the belt, Falmata made off down a dusty road. She had not gone far before she met two men on the side of the road. What she didn't know was that they, too, belonged to Boko Haram - but a different unit. Falmata was kidnapped for a second time. Sanaa Mehaydali is thought to have been the first female suicide bomber in modern history. The 16-year-old killed herself and two Israeli soldiers in a suicide attack in southern Lebanon in 1985. Since then, militant groups  such as Hezbollah, the Kurdish PKK, Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, Hamas and Black Widows in Chechnya, have all used women and girls to carry out  suicide attacks. But Boko Haram has outstripped any one group by far in the scale of its brutality, according to Elizabeth Pearson, associate fellow at the Royal United Service Institute in London. She estimates that hundreds of young girls have been forced to carry out attacks in the past three years, in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. By the end of 2017, 454 women and girls had been deployed or arrested in 232 incidents, Pearson says. The attacks killed 1,225 people. Pearson is the author of a study about Boko Haram’s use of female suicide bombers. The first time a girl was forced by the group to carry out an attack was June 2014. The bombing of a military barracks took place shortly after the notorious kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls, who became known as the Chibok girls. The mass abduction from a school dormitory in Borno state caused an international outcry. “[Boko Haram] got a lot more publicity with this attack than they did with previous suicide attacks using young boys. That’s why they kept using girls,” says Pearson. Fatima Akilu is a psychologist and executive director of the Neem Foundation which gives mental health support to communities affected by Boko Haram. She says at first it was mainly young men who carried out suicide attacks - ones who were inspired by Boko Haram’s ideology and rhetoric. “They mostly volunteered because they truly believed that they were going straight to paradise,” she says. “But when the [Nigerian] military offensive got more intense, the pool of young men volunteering dropped significantly, so Boko Haram started kidnapping and coercing young girls for suicide missions. And there seems to be no age limit to this cruelty. In December 2016, two girls said to be aged seven or eight were used in a double suicide bombing in a market in north-east Nigeria. After being abducted for a second time, Falmata was taken back into the forest. This time to a different camp. Had her captors known she had just abandoned a suicide mission, they would probably have killed her. Life at this camp was much the same as the other. It was the same daily cycle - eat, clean, pray, recite Islamic verses for hours, sleep. According to the Neem Foundation, women and children rescued from militants often adopt Boko Haram’s beliefs while under their control. “A lot of the people we meet who have been in these camps haven’t had much education before, neither Western nor Islamic,” says Akilu. “Many actually learn about the Koran for the first time while they’re in Boko Haram captivity. “They hold hundreds of people in their camps, and there is really nothing to do to keep them busy all day, so they end up having four or five hours of religious teachings. They find that religion is a coping strategy.” After a month or so of being in the new camp, Falmata was again presented with a choice - marriage or mission. Again, she refused to marry. But this time she was wiser when it came to the mission. She was painted with henna and given a beautiful dress and a headscarf. A belt of explosives was attached to her stomach. But this time she ran into the forest as soon as the fighters left her. “I met some farmers and asked them to help me remove the belt. I told them I was being forced to carry out a mission, but that I didn’t want to do it,” she says. Falmata left the farmers and spent several days in the forest trying to find her way back to Maiduguri, and to her family. On the way she joined a group of hunters who allowed her to travel with them across the woods. But the hunters were attacked by Boko Haram fighters. In the confusion, Falmata managed to slip away into the forest. “I didn’t know the forest. Every little sound would scare me, so I kept moving. I’d sleep on trees when I could,” she says. “I think I spent a whole week without food. I would drink stagnated water and also use this water to wash my hands and feet when praying. “I would pray two or three times a day whenever I could find water. I was so scared, but God helped me and I reached a town.” A local family gave her shelter for a few days and then helped her to get back to Maiduguri. For months after her escape, Falmata was in hiding. She was afraid the authorities would find out about her and she would be arrested. Fatima Akilu  has met a number of youngsters like Falmata. She says that when they return, they need time to re-establish family bonds. “She’s been away from her family for too long and she might have changed during this time. But her family may also have changed and have traumas of their own.” Like many families in Nigeria’s north-east, Falmata’s was split up by the fighting. She is now living with her mother in a camp for displaced people. Conditions are difficult, but at least no-one knows her story. Girls like Falmata face an incredibly difficult time. Most of those who don’t detonate their bombs are captured by the security forces and taken to a “deradicalisation centre”. These centres are run by the army and very little is known about what happens there. In mid January, the army said they had released the first group of “deradicalised” people, although it’s unclear where they are now. The few who do manage to slip back into their community unnoticed remain in the shadows. They are referred to by some in their communities as “annoba”, which means something like “epidemic”. Any girl that spent time with the militants will be seen as Boko Haram by many people, says Akilu. “I think that people in these communities tend to look at the act, rather than the girl. “They see the girl and think, ‘This is a young person who is willing to eliminate our whole community, how can we then take her back?’” She says the girls also remind them of the terror that they have lived through. Boko Haram is considered one of the deadliest militant groups in modern history. Since 2009 they have killed more than27,000 innocent people- including Muslims - in Nigeria alone. Many more have been killed in Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The fighting has displaced more than two million people. “Almost 90% of the communities in the north-east [of Nigeria] have been affected by Boko Haram. Either they have lost loved ones or entire families,” says Akilu. “So when the girls come back it’s almost like a secondary trauma. There’s a big problem with stigma. “We don’t really spend enough time looking at it from the point of view of the girls, and see them as the victims they are.” The second time Falmata had a suicide belt strapped to her, she was 14 years old.

"This video can not be played Abuse survivor Andrew Collins recounts his story Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he will deliver a national apology to victims of child sexual abuse.

The crimes, over decades, took place in institutions including churches, schools and sports clubs. The apology would be given later this year, Mr Turnbull said. ""As a nation, we must mark this occasion in a form that reflects the wishes of survivors and affords them the dignity to which they were entitled as children, but which was denied to them by the very people who were tasked with their care,"" he told parliament on Thursday.

"Theresa May has told Japanese business leaders that Brexit will allow the UK to strike a free trade deal with Japan. In the Downing Street meeting she told bosses, including from Nissan, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, and Honda, that Brexit was ""no small undertaking"". The prime minister also said the government's modern industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"". The meeting comes amidconcern over estimates of the impactof Brexit on economic growth. Chancellor Phillip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also attended the meeting. ""I recognise that the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union is no small undertaking, but importantly it does present the opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world and build on our already very strong relationship that we have with Japan,"" Mrs May told the assembled bosses. ""As we look to the relationship between the UK and Japan we see already year-on-year trade between our two countries continues to increase, with Japans's investment in the UK reaching Â£46.5bn in 2016."" ""Just today we have seen the Bank of England raise its forecast for UK growth compared with its estimates three months ago,"" Mrs May added. Representatives from Japanese banks and drug companies also attended the meeting. Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over the past decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent. EU 'seeks single market sanction power' Pressure on May to choose over Brexit Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their UK operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars. The big majority of these are exported. The motor industry has expressed concern that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10% and be subject to customs delays after Britain leaves the European Union. Japanese drug companies have also made Britain their European base. Some are concerned about future drug regulations, with any divergence with the EU likely to pose regulatory challenges. London is also home to Japanese banks, such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. Like other foreign banks, they are keen to know about trading and so-called ""passporting"" arrangements for access to the EU. In 2016 Nissan chief executiveCarlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May amid fears over the future of its production plant in Sunderland. Nissan sought assurances over post-Brexit arrangements ahead of future investment in the Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest car factory.

"Low rates of pay and workload pressures mean care services can no longer fill key posts in England, a watchdog says. TheNational Audit Office,externalsaid a lack of government planning and funding had undermined the ""Cinderella"" service and its 1.34 million staff. The sector was struggling in particular to recruit nurses and senior staff to run services, causing the elderly and disabled to go without care, it said. The warning comes as ministers draw up plans to overhaul the sector. The government has promised a Green Paper with proposals to change the way care services work will be published by the summer. This will cover care homes and support in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing paid for both by councils and privately by individuals. The NAO said changes were desperately needed, as there was no guarantee the extra Â£2bn being invested in the sector over the next three years would have any significant impact. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care Tammy Ardron works as a nurse in a nursing home in South Yorkshire. She says she is not surprised nurses turn their backs on the sector because it is an incredibly demanding job. She says she works 12-hour shifts and has to care for 30 different people at a time, many with complex conditions and challenging behaviour. ""It is busy. You've got to be on the ball all the time. ""When you are hospital based you have doctors at the end of the beep, somebody to call on. Here you are on your own."" The review warned low rates of pay - most of the 815,000 carers in the system were paid less than Â£7.50 an hour and a third were on zero-hour contracts - was making it difficult to attract staff. Across the sector, 6.6% of posts remained unfilled, with 28% of staff leaving their jobs each year - double the rate in the wider economy. But the most serious problems were being seen in key posts: One in 11 nursing posts was vacant, after the numbers working in the sector fell by 8,000 to 43,000 in the past four years One in nine register-manager jobs was unfilled, these are considered vital to ensure services comply with laws and regulations The NAO said it was clear councils were struggling to find the money to fund the services properly. And this had meant that people who paid their own fees - the system is means-tested - were effectively subsidising the state. NAO chief Amyas Morse said: ""Social care cannot continue as a Cinderella service - without a valued and rewarded workforce."" Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said councils were doing all they could to ""protect services"", but without extra funding in the forthcoming change of the system she feared providers of services would start pulling out of the sector. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the report was a ""damning indictment of the failure of successive governments"" and meant frail older people were going without the care they needed. The government said it would unveil its plans for the sector later in the year and also pointed out Health Education England was currently putting together a 10-year workforce strategy which would take a long-term look at the sustainability of the health and care sectors.

"Robin Williams was famous for films such as Good Morning,Vietnam and won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting US suicide rates spiked in the months after Robin Williams killed himself in 2014, according to researchers. In the five months after the actor's death there were 10% more suicides than might be expected, or 1,841 extra cases, PLOS One journal reports. The potential risk of copycat incidents after celebrity cases is known to public health bodies. It cannot be known for certain if his death led to the spike but it appeared to be connected, the new study said. Experts say ""irresponsible"" media coverage of suicides can play a big part in copycat cases. Williams, who starred in films such as Good Morning, Vietnam and Good Will Hunting,was found dead in August 2014. At the time of his death,the Samaritans warned about a large number of news articles giving too much detail about the nature of his suicide,external, against media guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organization, the Independent Press Standards Organisation's editors' code of practice, the Ofcom broadcasting code and the BBC's editorial guidelines all advise against going into explicit detail about the methods used. However, researchers said there was ""substantial evidence"" that many media outlets had tended to deviate from these guidelines. Williams won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting For the latest study, they looked at the monthly suicide rates from the US government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between January 1999 and December 2015 to see if there had been a spike. They found there were 18,690 suicides between August and December 2014 compared with the 16,849 cases they would have expected. In the weeks after Williams's death, there was a ""drastic"" increase in references to suicide and death in news media reports, as well as more posts on an internet suicide forum researchers monitored, the study found. David Fink, one of the study's authors, from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said research had previously shown that suicide rates increased following a high-profile celebrity suicide, but this was a first time such a study had been done within the era of the 24-hour news cycle. He told the BBC: ""By other people being aware of this person that they saw and can relate to having this experience, they gained the ability to take this action that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. ""That is where the press comes in. ""The more people hear and learn about the specific details of it, the more they can relate to it, potentially."" The researchers said it was possible another event also capable of increasing suicide rates had occurred during the same period as Williams's death but ""unlikely"". Netflix added an extra warning to a TV series called 13 Reasons Why Last year,Netflix added an extra warning to a TV series called 13 Reasons Whyamid concerns that viewers might copy its depiction of suicide. Lorna Fraser, from the Samaritans' media advisory service, said: ""This study builds on a strong body of research evidence that shows that irresponsible or overly detailed depictions of suicide can have a devastating impact. ""In the case of celebrities, the potential for someone at risk to make an emotional connection and over-identify with them is greater, in some cases even to interpret their death as affirmation that they could take their own life."" The influence celebrities can have on the public, whether positive or negative, should not be underestimated, said Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. When British reality TV star Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer, in 2008, and died, in 2009, research showed about an extra 400,000 women attended cervical screening appointments. Goody had spoken out publicly about her disease and the importance of screening. Mr Music said the ""Jade Goody"" effect had since faded and screening attendance in England was now at a 20-year low.

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi ""Black cab rapist"" John Worboys faced one of his victims in court as an appeal to challenge his release was granted. Worboys, who was jailed for drugging and sexually assaulting passengers, was due to be freed on licence. He appeared at the High Court earlier, where judges heard a judicial review application lodged by two of his victims, one of whom attended court. Worboys was told he would remain in jail until a full hearing on 13 March. He was summoned to appear in person at the Royal Courts of Justice by Sir Brian Leveson after the judge had a ""bad experience"" with a prison video link. Worboys' victims were unaware he would be present, but Sir Brian said it was important there was ""no interruption"" in proceedings. Launch of legal bid against Worboys' release Would London ban be enforceable? Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Solicitor Harriet Wistrich said one of the victims, who was in court throughout the hearing, found it ""very, very difficult"" that Worboys was also there. She added: ""She felt it was really necessary to be there and to say she wasn't going to be frightened of him being there, and to challenge his power. ""But obviously it is hard seeing him there in the flesh after all this time."" Ms Wistrich, who is representing both victims behind the judicial review action, said after the hearing: ""We are obviously very pleased that permission has been granted to proceed. ""We are looking forward to being able to understand and scrutinise all the material before the Parole Board, to consider how to bring forward a challenge."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences including one count of rape, but is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. He was given an indefinite jail sentence in 2009, with a minimum term of eight years. This video can not be played 'Fiona', a victim of John Worboys, tells Today police told her in 2003 she wasn't 'believable' On 4 January the Parole Board announced its decision to release Worboyson licence, prompting anger among his victims and in Parliament. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys' release, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. However, the government said it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Justice Secretary David Gauke said at the time ""it would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review, but added that his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" The legal challenge was described in court as ""unique"" and ""unprecedented"", never before has someone other than a prisoner tried to overturn a Parole Board release decision. The hearing itself was also highly unusual, with John Worboys appearing in person, looking frail, thin and slightly hunched. It's the first time he's been seen in public since he was sentenced in 2009. During the proceedings Sir Brian Leveson spoke to Worboys - referring to him by his new name, Mr Radford - to seek his agreement on the disclosure of documents about his release. Halfway through, a solicitor, who had taken an interest in the case and was in court, agreed to represent the convicted sex offender, assuming he's granted legal aid. What wasn't a surprise about the case was the outcome - it will go to a full hearing next month when the decision to sanction Worboys' release can be scrutinised in detail. The case was brought forward by two of Worboys' victims and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. They are crowdfunding their action and have been pledged more than Â£62,000. Earlier in the hearing, Worboys agreed that the victims and Mr Khan should be allowed to see the Parole Board's reasons for ordering his release. Ben Collins, for the Parole Board, told the court: ""The board does not wish to take any step to prevent a review of the decision and does not propose to stand in the way."" Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing two of Worboys' victims, said it appeared something had gone ""very wrong"" and the victims were ""concerned not only for themselves but for the wider public and women in particular"". The victims were also concerned that the decision was ""made entirely in secret,"" Ms Kaufmann said. Reacting to the ruling, mayor Sadiq Khan said Worboys' victims and Londoners would be ""relieved"". ""I'm pleased that there will now be an opportunity for thorough scrutiny of this decision by the Parole Board,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju were hailed at the parade North Korea has held a military parade attended by leader Kim Jong-un, a day before the opening of the Winter Olympics in the South. The North often boasts of its parades but reports of this surfaced afterwards with TV only airing delayed footage. This event is usually held in April and moving it had been seen as a setback to the warming of ties over the Olympics. But the South announced on Thursday its president would meet the North's Olympics delegation on Saturday. Moon Jae-in will have lunch with the 22-strong team, which will include the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, and Kim Yo-jong, the influential sister of Kim Jong-un who will become the first member of the ruling dynasty to visit the South. Both were at the parade. Early on Thursday state TV began showing patriotic films in what appeared to be a prelude to a live broadcast. But delayed and unscheduled footage of the event only appeared on TV in the North at 17:00 local time (08:30 GMT). The parade this year marks the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army The parade was reportedly smaller than recent years and the footage showed Kim Jong-un inspecting troops, alongside his wife Ri Sol-ju. There was the traditional goose-steeping and a show of heavy weapons. Mr Kim said the North had become a ""world-class military power"". The annual parade, which this year marks the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army, is normally held in April and this was the first time in 40 years it had been given a February date. Such parades are often given a much higher profile. In 2017, North Korea aired a live broadcast of its military parade on state television. Foreign journalists were invited to cover the event. South Korean government officials said last month that some 13,000 troops and 200 pieces of equipment had been spotted near an airport in Pyongyang in what appeared to be a rehearsal for the parade. Analysis: Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring While much of the parade was standard fare, it was the event's climax with the appearance of North Korea's missile force that drew the greatest attention. The stars of the show were four Hwasong-15 ballistic missiles on their nine-axled TEL vehicles (Transport Elevator Launcher). The Hwasong-15 made its maiden flight in November last year and has a claimed range of more than 13,000km (8,000 miles), which would theoretically put Washington DC in range. It's the first time that multiple examples of the type have been seen together. Also on display were several Hwasong-14 missiles (designated KN-20 by the US) on extended truck mounts, as well as Hwasong-12 (KN-17) and Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) intermediate range missiles. Most notable by their absence were any additional TEL vehicles, possibly meaning the North is still struggling to overcome a shortage. Some observers also saw possible clones or copies of Russian 9K720 Iskander short-range ballistic missiles. The North had insisted on the event, despite criticism from the US and others about its timing - a day before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February in the mountain town of Pyeongchang. It had appeared to be a setback to the rapprochement with the South over the Games, which has generally seen a political charm offensive by the North. But commentators in the South said avoiding live TV coverage may have been an attempt to keep the parade low key. The parade is not the only challenge the apparent warming of ties has faced. There has been criticism in the South about a joint women's ice hockey team, andthe North cancelled a pre-Olympics cultural event, citing media bias in the South. How the attendance of the North's delegation fits in with international sanctions and blacklists has also been a problem. South Korea has had to ask the UN for an exemption to allow Choe Hwi, a UN sanctioned North Korean official, to attend.

Most of its 280-strong delegation, including 229 cheerleaders, four officials from the National Olympic Committee, 26 taekwondo demonstrators and 21 journalists. arrived via a border crossing on Wednesday. On Thursday, North Korea said it had no intention of meeting US officials during the event. 'Peace Olympics' politics explained Vice-President Mike Pence arrived in South Korea on Thursday and met President Moon later in the day. Mr Moon said the ""most important thing is close co-operation between South Korea and the United States"" and that the US's ""firm stance"" had created the opportunity for North-South dialogue. The US has been sceptical of the North's actions. Mr Pence said earlier he wanted to ""make sure North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the [Games] to paper over the truth about their regime"". This video can not be played Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono: ""N Korea charm offensive shows sanctions work"" He also said the US would soon unveil ""the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever"". Although he did not close the door to talks, saying there was the ""possibility for any kind of an encounter"", he said he would tell the North it would need to ""once and for all abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile ambition"". It has now been confirmed Kim Jong-un's sister will attend Friday's opening ceremony. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says this could provide a diplomatic headache, as Mr Pence will be there with the father of Otto Warmbier, who died after being imprisoned in North Korea.

"Stotts Tours did not set up pensions for staff A bus company has become the first UK firm to be sentenced for failing to enrol staff on a pension scheme. Stotts Tours of Oldham, Greater Manchester, should have begun pension contributions for staff from 2015, The Pensions Regulator (TPR) said. The firm and its managing director Alan Stott previously admitted wilful failure to comply with pensions law. They were ordered to pay more than Â£39,000 at Brighton Magistrates' Court. District Judge Teresa Szagun said: ""Initially Mr Stott's attitude was to bury his head in the sand. This later left him in a position where he was out of his depth."" The fines and court costs come on top of Â£14,400 in civil fines already owed for failing to comply with the law on automatic pension enrolment. Stotts Tours must also pay an estimated Â£10,000 in backdated pension contributions for its staff, as well as ongoing contributions. Magistrates fined the company Â£27,000 and ordered it to pay Â£7,400 in costs and a Â£120 victim surcharge on Wednesday. Stott, 69, was ordered to pay a Â£4,455 fine and a Â£120 victim surcharge. According to the Pensions Act 2008,,externalevery employer in the UK, where appropriate, must contribute towards a pension scheme for their staff in a process known as automatic enrolment. Auto-enrolment has been phased inby the government since 2012, so that workers can save to top-up their state pension on retirement. Unless they are already signed up to a workplace pension, a slice of a worker's pay packet is automatically diverted to a pension savings pot, which is invested until retirement Their employer also makes a contribution, as does the government Individuals have the option to opt out if they wish, although that will mean losing the employer's contribution Anyone on a short-term contract, working where an agency pays their wages, or who is on maternity, adoption or carer's leave should still be eligible The total minimum contribution is currently set at 2% of earnings (0.8% from the worker, 1% from an employer, and 0.2% as tax relief from the government) From April 2018, it will increase to 5% of earnings (2.4% from the worker, 2% from the employer, and 0.6% as tax relief) From April 2019 onwards, it will rise to 8% of earnings (4% from the individual, 3% from the employer, and 1% as tax relief) In the first prosecution of its kind, TPR found 36 staff from Stotts Tours should have been put on a pension scheme from June 2015. TPR director Darren Ryder said ""automatic enrolment is not an option, it is the law"". He said: ""It's extremely disappointing that a tiny minority of employers continue to flout the law by denying their staff the pensions they are entitled to.""

"On the centenary of some British women winning the right to vote, 100 Women speaks to six women who share their first name with suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Spread across the globe, from Kigali to Sao Paulo, they all say their name has made them more inclined to fight for women's rights, even if they weren't originally named after the feminist icon. I am 40 this year, so experiencing my own big anniversary, in a way. I remember as a child being very proud of being born on on the 60th anniversary of limited suffrage and the 50th of full suffrage. I am fairly sure I ended up such a loudmouthed feminist because of my early childhood fascination with Pankhurst and what she represented. My mum said she'd always hoped that naming me after Pankhurst would produce a strong and powerful person. I wasn't a child that was afraid to have an opinion - even when I was little I would challenge my mum's friends if they said things that I didn't think were OK. Kids like seeing their names in books so every time I saw a reference to Pankhurst I got excited - it's not really taught as part of our history syllabus. And whilst I hated it as an awkward early teenager because it made me different, it made me aware of the responsibility that Emmelines have to be a force for good. I started a blog in 2014 to document my journey in giving up drinking, but after a while I got bored of writing about alcohol and started writing about feminism and self esteem.""Consent: Not Actually That Complicated"" was one of those weekly blogs,,externallike many I had written before, but for some reason it caught people's attention, and when I woke up in the morning my little blog had gone viral. It feels amazing to have written something that has started so many conversations about sex and consent. I am currently doing a history masters degree part-time in gender, sexuality and culture, and realising there is so much more to the women's movement than just the fight for suffrage. The downside to my name is there's never anything in a gift shop with Emmeline on! I had a great aunt who was called Emmeline, born around the turn of the century. I've always been very inspired by the name -  I like the idea of a feisty female role model who fought for women's rights. From a young age I always knew about Emmeline Pankhurst and last year for International Women's Day everyone in the office nominated a woman who inspired them for a photo wall and I put Emmeline Pankhurst up as my woman. I work for Dfid (UK Department for International Development) and have been in Kigali for almost four years, working as a social development adviser. I do a lot of work on gender and equality and women's empowerment. I don't think anyone in Rwanda knows who Pankhurst is - I think she's very much a figure of British history. Interestingly Rwanda ranks number one on the Gender Representation Index, due to the high proportion of women in parliament - far above the UK. In Rwanda 62% of parliamentarians are female and there are several powerful female ministers in government, but gender-based violence remains widespread and accepted, and in contrast to the large proportion of female parliamentarians, at the local level only 10% of mayors are women. Soon I'm being posted to Mozambique to work on an innovative programme empowering adolescent girls and women - where the situation for women is much more challenging, with high rates of child marriage, teenage pregnancy and much weaker female political representation. I think it's nice to have a name that has a story behind it. I actually named my daughter after Isolde in the story Tristan and Isolde and my son after Prince Caspian by CS Lewis. Christabel Pankhurst worked alongside her mother in the campaign to get women the vote I am the only Emmeline that I know. My mother searched in a name book and it said ""industrious and striving"". She said that she had heard of Emmeline Pankhurst - she didn't study her in the history syllabus but she knew she was an important person in history. I would have really loved to have learned about her - when I was younger I would search online to see if there were any other Emmelines out there and her name would come up first. I think looking back now I would say that it did have an impact on me - I am fairly outspoken and I do seek fairness in certain situations. There is a fine line between feminism and sexism - and in Asia those who aren't well versed with the term would relate it to a woman who was outspoken or demanding of more than they should. But it really is about having a voice in gender equality and creating a level playing field in terms of salary and equal opportunities. That is what feminism is ultimately, so if you were to ask me if I was a feminist then yes I would say I am. About 10 years ago I represented Malaysia for Miss World. I think these days it's a really good platform for women to speak out about the domestic issues in their country. In recent years there have been more women speaking up about women's rights and providing platforms for abused women in bad relationships or domestic violence, but the problem at the moment is there are not enough shelters provided to help these people. It would be good if the government would step up and provide more funding. There are more women-only facilities now - like women-only car parks closer to the entrance of shops, and they have train cabins that are women only. I think there should be more of it - you want to feel safe. It's a bit sad that it's necessary, but it's a good fix for now. I don't think Emmeline Pankhurst was the only reason my mum named me Emmeline - she liked the name and she never raised me saying 'you're named after Emmeline Pankhurst', but she was very interested in the suffragettes and she would describe herself as a feminist, so I think it played a part. People often say to me, 'That's a really beautiful name', and sometimes they'd say, 'Were you named afterthat Hot Chocolate song,external?' Very few people thought it might have been because of Pankhurst but I've always enjoyed that it gave me the opportunity for me to say, 'My mum's a feminist and was a fan of Pankhurst'. It was a start to a conversation about it. When we were growing up in the 1990s [in the UK] there was less talk about feminism than there is now - my mum talked about these ideas in the home but outside the home they weren't talked about. I studied GCSE history and we studied that time - and the suffragettes just came up as a sentence or a paragraph in our notes in a two-year course. It really was just a sentence of history. To think it's only 100 years ago - it's extraordinary because as you get older your sense of time and history changes. I would say I'm a feminist but I would like to not have to say that about myself. I want to be able to live in a world where I don't have to make that statement in order to get my rights. I think it's an amazing time for women but I believe that people just have to keep having conversations with themselves and with their friends, partners, with their sons and daughters. The only way things really change is when everyone is included in these conversations. It feels very media focused and that the media tends to polarise everything and that doesn't reflect in any way my own reality and my experience of talking to other people in my life. If you respect the opinions of others, people are also happy to listen to your point of view. It's these conversations that can help lead to change. My mum's told me I was named after Emmeline Pankhurst and it's always been important to me - the equality of both genders - and I really feel that's part of my character. I do feel there's a level of expectation to meet the fact I was named after her - especially when it comes to feminist issues. I feel it's important to stand up and talk about these things. My mum talked about the difference between when she was younger compared to when I was young- the opportunities to go abroad, to take on different career options, the flexibility for women to participate in all these different career options, and I've always tried to take those opportunities. But when I talk about Emmeline Pankhurst it's usually older generations (40-somethings onwards) who know who she is - I normally get blank faces from people younger than that. It is an unusual name here. The first choice was Larissa but my parents had a neighbour who had a daughter called Larissa and they didn't get on with each other so they decided to choose another name. And then my dad read Emmeline by Judith Rossner. It's a really good book. It's about a little girl who needed to leave her home and move to Massachusetts when she was 13 years old, to help her parents survive financially. It's kind of a sad story but she learned a lot about life really early on and the way that the author wrote it is really interesting. My parents weren't aware of the link with Emmeline Pankhurst. They have never left Brazil. But I like the fact that I share her name. I think it sounds like a strong name. Maybe I have been inspired by it. I left home at 21 and I live in Sao Paulo alone. I could develop my career far away from the family home and comfort zone. And I am a volunteer ina group called Startup Weekend Women,external- we have more than 1,000 girls in this movement for women in tech - we help people transform ideas into business. Feminism is growing in Brazil. Because the tech environment is very male that's my vision - we are getting strong about female inclusion and I think it's getting better.

"Frustrating. That's how some women describe accessing the vote, 100 years after the law changed. Despite having a legal right to vote, some are still unable to cast a ballot at election time - or at least not in secret. The government has put systems in place to help, but many people say these are often cumbersome and leave people reliant on family or friends. ""There is no autonomy,"" Ruksana Khanum, a law graduate who is partially-sighted, says. Blind and partially-sighted people are provided with a tactile overlay for their ballot paper, but this only indicates numbers down the left-hand side and where the boxes are to cross. No names or parties are rendered in braille. Ruksana says this leaves her reliant on a family member or friend to read out the ballot paper for her and then, as the overlay has a tendency to slip, to check that she has actually crossed the intended box. As the youth forum advisor for the Royal Society for Blind Children, she is campaigning for a more accessible ballot paper. ""Frustration is pervasive,"" she adds. With technology ""we can do things - but with this fundamental right, we are stuck in the dark ages"". Ruksana Khanum campaigns for better access to voting for blind and partially-sighted people Despite the Electoral Commission's directions to local authorities,external, advising them to ensure polling stations do not disadvantage disabled people,a 2010 survey by the disability charity Scope,externalfound two-thirds of them had access issues. From simple problems such as steps and tables being too high - creating barriers for wheelchair users - to difficulties arranging proxy votes for people who cannot use a pen, disabled women and men are finding themselves struggling to access the democratic process. Domestic violence vote law plans unveiled Why do disabled people feel ignored when it comes to voting? Remembering suffragist Millicent Fawcett Scope's head of policy, James Taylor, said he had heard of disabled people being turned away from polling stations. ""This should not be happening and councils must work to make all necessary changes. If we want everyday equality, then an equal share in our democracy is one of the fundamental places we need to start,"" he added. Before the last election, social media was awash with pleas for people to register to vote. Many emphasised how quick and easy it was to do; simply fill out a very short online form and you were good to go. But for homeless women, including some of the 60,000 living in temporary accommodation, this simple-sounding task is almost impossible. People who cannot provide a permanent address cannot use the standard online form but must instead print a different one and return it - by post or by hand - to a local electoral office. The resources needed to do this (access to the internet, a printer etc) are hard to come by for these women. Combined with a general lack of knowledge about the possibility of registering without an address, this means that although a system exists to allow homeless women to vote, many remain unregistered and unheard. The same appears to be true for survivors of domestic violence - a system is in place, but it is complicated and difficult to navigate. For many abuse survivors, registering to vote in the regular way is dangerous. Being registered means their names and addresses would appear on the public electoral roll, allowing perpetrators to find out exactly where they live. One survivor of domestic violence explained the lengths she went to to keep her address secret. ""I even removed the house numbers from the front door in case he came looking,"" she said of her abuser. Describing her time in a safe house, she says: ""I was unaware at the time that not registering would adversely affect my credit rating for a prolonged time and, of course, I forfeited my right to vote."" She says that women need protection so they can rebuild their lives, including regaining their democratic voice. Mehala Osborne survived abuse and launched the campaign to have the law changed to allow anonymous registration Currently, there is a system in place which allows survivors to register anonymously, so long as they can provide documentation (almost always a court order) proving that regular registration would compromise their safety. The issue, according to the charity Women's Aid, is that many survivors do not have these documents; they have not been through a legal process. Nor can they easily get them. According to Women's Aid, letters of evidence ""can only be signed by very senior figures in specific agencies, such as the director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency"". The charity is calling for the bar for eligible evidence to be lowered, so that refuge workers and health professionals can attest to a woman's status. Domestic violence vote law plans unveiled The charity's chief executive, Katie Ghose, said that ""while 2018 is a time for us to celebrate the long hard battle our sisters fought to secure suffrage... we must remember that some women continue to be silenced"". She emphasised that anonymity ""is a matter of life and death"" and that ""women are often on the run for the rest of their lives"". The charity is therefore also calling for anonymous registration to be valid indefinitely. ""We urge the government to mark this centenary by sending out a clear message to all survivors of domestic abuse: that their voices matter, and their right to vote will never be taken away.""
